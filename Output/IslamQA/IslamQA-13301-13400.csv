I attend a Catholic College, and many of my muslims friend have stated that it is not a rightful act to attend a catholic school. However, I'm not forced to take any of the classes that relate to the Catholisicm. Also, I pray in school, so is there anything wrong with praying in a Catholic school?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Undoubtedly these schools pose a great danger to the Muslim 
    who is ignorant of Islam and its teachings, because they give lessons and 
    teach information in which there is approval and praise of the kaafirs and 
    their religions and beliefs, and usually attack Islam and condemn the 
    Muslims. But if the student in these schools has a sound understanding of 
    the beliefs of Islam, and knows the pillars of Islam and what is halaal and 
    what is haraam in Islam, and he needs to go to such a school in order to 
    learn a skill or profession or a gain specific knowledge, and he is 
    confident that he will not be influenced by their lessons and teachers, and 
    he will not be forced to learn any of the subjects that have to do with 
    Catholicism, then in that case we think that it is o.k. for him to study 
    there. Rather we worry about one who is ignorant and does not understand the 
    plots of the kaafirs and their tricks against the Muslims. But whoever is 
    confident and adheres to the beliefs and practices of Islam, then usually 
    such a person would not be affected by their teachings and practice.",Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Jibreen
13307,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13307,Making food during the mourning period,What is the ruling on making food during the period of mourning? What is the ruling on guests of the household eating the food that has been brought to them?,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is better for neighbours and relatives to make food 
          in their own houses then bring it to the household (of the deceased), 
          because it was narrated that when the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) heard that his cousin Ja’far 
          ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him) had died in the Battle 
          of Mu’tah, he told his family to make food for the family of Ja’far, 
          and said, “Because there has come to them that which will preoccupy 
          them.” 
 But it is not permitted for the family to make food 
          for people because for the sake of the deceased. This is one of the 
          actions of the Jaahiliyyah, whether it is done on the day of the death, 
          or on the fourth or tenth day after the death, or at the new year. All 
          of that is not permitted, because it was narrated that Jareer ibn ‘Abd-Allaah 
          al-Bajali (may Allaah be pleased with him) – one of the companions of 
          the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) – said, “We used to count gathering with the 
          family of the deceased and making food for them after the burial to 
          be a kind of wailing (niyaahah).”  
But if guests come to the family of the deceased during 
          the mourning period, there is nothing wrong with them making food for 
          them for the sake of hospitality, and there is nothing wrong with the 
          household inviting whoever they want of their neighbours and relatives 
          to eat with them from the food that has been given to them. And Allaah 
          is the Source of strength.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 9, p. 325"
13308,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13308,Shaytaan’s Enmity Towards Man,I want to know some details about the Shaytaan – can you help me?,,,"Praise be to Allah.When Iblees (the Satan)refused to prostrate to Adam, Allaah expelled him from heaven and the curse of Allaah is upon him until the Day of Resurrection.  Allaah said to him: 
“Then get out from here; for verily, you are outcast.
And verily, My Curse is on you till the Day of Recompense”
[Saad 38:77-78 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Then he asked Allaah to grant him respite until the Resurrection, and He granted him that: 
“(Iblees) said: ‘Allow me respite till the Day they are raised up (i.e. the Day of Resurrection).’
(Allaah) said: ‘You are of those respited’”
[al-A’raaf 7:14-15 – interpretation of the meaning] 
When Iblees felt safe from destruction, he rebelled and transgressed: 
“(Iblees) said: ‘Because You have sent me astray, surely, I will sit in wait against them (human beings) on Your straight path.
Then I will come to them from before them and behind them, from their right and from their left, and You will not find most of them as thankful ones (i.e. they will not be dutiful to You)’”
[al-A’raaf 7:16-17 – interpretation of the meaning] 
When Iblees said that, Allaah said to him: 
“(Allaah) said: ‘Go, and whosoever of them follows you, surely, Hell will be the recompense of you (all) an ample recompense.
And befool them gradually those whom you can among them with your voice (i.e. songs, music, and any other call for Allaah’s disobedience), make assaults on them with your cavalry and your infantry, share with them wealth and children (by tempting them to earn money by illegal ways usury, or by committing illegal sexual intercourse), and make promises to them.’ But Satan promises them nothing but deceit.
‘Verily, My slaves (i.e. the true believers of Islamic Monotheism) — you have no authority over them. And All-Sufficient is your Lord as a Guardian’”
[al-Israa’ 17:62-64 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Hence the Shaytaan declared his evil and his enmity towards the children of Adam, so he started to make sin attractive to them and to tempt them with haraam (unlawful)and evil things, and to enjoin evil and immoral actions upon them. Thus most of the people were deceived by him and they fell into those sins and haraam things: 
“And indeed Iblees (Satan) did prove true his thought about them, and they followed him, all except a group of true believers (in the Oneness of Allaah)”
[Saba’ 34:20 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Everything that happens among the sons of Adam of kufr (disbelief), murder, enmity, hatred, the spread of immorality and zina (adultery/fornication), the wanton display of women’s beauty, drinking alcohol, worshipping idols and other major sins, is all the work of the Shaytaan, in order to prevent people from following the way of Allaah and to corrupt mankind and drag them to the Fire of Hell with him: 
“O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al-Ansaab (stone altars), and Al-Azlaam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytaan’s (Satan’s) handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.
Shaytaan (Satan) wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants (alcoholic drinks) and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allaah and from As Salaah (the prayer). So, will you not then abstain?”
[al-Maa’idah 5:90-91 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Allaah has warned us against following the Shaytaan and walking in his footsteps, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Follow not the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan). And whosoever follows the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan), then, verily, he commands Al Fahshaa’ [i.e. to commit indecency (illegal sexual intercourse)], and Al Munkar [disbelief and polytheism (i.e. to do evil and wicked deeds; and to speak or to do what is forbidden in Islam)]
[al-Noor 24:21] 
When a person turns away from Allaah, the Shaytaan gains control over him and encourages him to commit sin and transgression: 
“See you not that We have sent the Shayaateen (devils) against the disbelievers to push them to do evil
[Maryam 19:83 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Everyone who turns away from Allaah and follows the Shaytaan is only destroying his own self and is a loser in this world and in the Hereafter: 
“And whoever takes Shaytaan (Satan) as a Wali (protector or helper) instead of Allaah, has surely, suffered a manifest loss
[al-Nisa’ 4:119 – interpretation of the meaning] 
The Shaytaan uses strange ways to tempt people; he has corrupted many of mankind and made their evil deeds attractive to them, so he is the cause of their going to Hell, what a terrible fate! 
“He [Shaytaan (Satan)] makes promises to them, and arouses in them false desires; and Shaytaan’s (Satan) promises are nothing but deceptions.
The dwelling of such (people) is Hell, and they will find no way of escape from it
[al-Nisa’ 4:120-121 – interpretation of the meaning] 
The enmity of the Shaytaan towards Adam and his descendants is ancient. Allaah caused Adam and his wife to dwell in Paradise, then the Shaytaan came to Adam and made sin attractive to him, so Adam obeyed him, thinking that he was sincere. Thus Adam disobeyed his Lord and was expelled from Paradise, then Allaah accepted his repentance. Allaah warns us against obeying the Shaytaan, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O Children of Adam! Let not Shaytaan (Satan) deceive you, as he got your parents [Adam and Hawwa’ (Eve)] out of Paradise
[al-A’raaf 7:27] 
Because the enmity of Shaytaan towards mankind is so clear and obvious, Allaah tells us to beware of him and to declare war on him and to show enmity to him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Surely, Shaytaan (Satan) is an enemy to you, so take (treat) him as an enemy. He only invites his Hizb (followers) that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire
[Faatir 35:6] 
Allaah has told us to seek refuge with Allaah from the outcast Shaytaan every time we think of sinning. He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if an evil whisper from Shaytaan (Satan) tries to turn you away (O Muhammad) (from doing good), then seek refuge in Allaah. Verily, He is the All Hearer, the All Knower
[Fussilat 41:36] 
On the Day of Resurrection, the Day of truth and justice, the Shaytaan will confess to his crimes and will declare before all of creation that Allaah is the One Who tells the truth and that he is a liar. He will say that there is no blame on him; rather the blame is on those who followed him. Then everyone who followed him will regret it, but at that time regret will be of no avail: 
“And Shaytaan (Satan) will say when the matter has been decided: ‘Verily, Allaah promised you a promise of truth. And I too promised you, but I betrayed you. I had no authority over you except that I called you, and you responded to me. So blame me not, but blame yourselves. I cannot help you, nor can you help me. I deny your former act in associating me (Satan) as a partner with Allaah (by obeying me in the life of the world). Verily, there is a painful torment for the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers)’”

13317,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13317,Abortion of pregnancy resulting from rape,What can those Muslim women do who have been assaulted and become pregnant as a result of rape? Is it permissible for them to abort the foetus or not?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Because the Muslims have become so weak and humiliated, they, along with their lands and their honour, have become fair game for anyone; the nations call one another to attack them from all sides. Many Muslim women have often become a target for the scavenging wolves of humanity, who do not fear Allaah or any deterrent, as is the case in many countries in the Muslim world, and as has happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the Philippines, in Chechnya, in Eritrea, and in the prisons of some of the contemptible systems of the Arab world.
There follow some important points concerning the woman who has been raped:
1 – The raped woman who did her utmost to resist these thugs and their ilk is not guilty of any sin, because she was forced into it, and the one who is forced to do something is not guilty of sin in the case of kufr, which is worse than zinaa (unlawful sexual activity), as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“except him who is forced thereto and whose heart is at rest with Faith…”
[al-Nahl 16:106]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah has forgiven my ummah for their mistakes, what they forget and what they are forced to do.” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah in al-Talaaq, 2033; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan Ibn Maajah, 1664).
The Muslim woman who has fallen prey to a rapist will be rewarded for bearing this calamity with patience, if she seeks reward with Allaah for the harm that has befallen her. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No stress or exhaustion befalls the Muslim, nor worry or distress, even a thorn which pricks him, but Allaah will expiate for his sins because of that.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim).
2 – Young Muslim men should hasten to marry women such as these who have been tormented, so as to reduce their suffering and console them, to compensate them for the loss of the most precious thing that they possess, which is their virginity.
3 – With regard to their having abortions – the basic principle concerning abortion is that it is haraam and is not allowed from the moment of conception when it becomes a new being and is “placed in a place of safety” [cf. al-Mursalaat 77:21], i.e., the womb, even if this being is the result of a haraam relationship such as zinaa. In the case of the Ghaamidi woman who had confessed to zina and thus the punishment of stoning became obligatory, the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told her to go away until after she had given birth, then after she had given birth, he told her to go away until the child was weaned.
4 – There are some fuqahaa’ who think that it is permissible to have an abortion within the first forty days of pregnancy. Some of them even permit it until before the soul is breathed into the embryo. The stronger the excuse, the clearer the reason for the concession is, and if that is within the first forty days it is, this means that the concession is more appropriate.
5 – Undoubtedly the rape of a Muslim woman by an evil enemy is a strong reason for the Muslim woman and for her family to have an abortion. For she will hate this foetus, the result of this iniquitous attack, and she will want to get rid of it. So this concession is to be given because of necessity, especially in the first days of the pregnancy.
6 – Nevertheless, there is nothing wrong with a Muslim woman who has suffered this disaster keeping the foetus without being forced to get rid of it. If it is decreed that it should remain in her womb for the usual term and she gives birth to it, then it will be a Muslim child, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Every newborn is born in a state of fitrah (the natural state of man, i.e., Islam).” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari). The fitrah is the religion of Tawheed, i.e., Islam. It has been stated in fiqh that if the parents have different religions, the child should follow the parent who has the best religion. This is in cases where the father is known, but what about the child who has no father? He is a Muslim child, no doubt, and the Muslim society is obliged to take care of his upbringing, to spend on him and to bring him up well. They should not leave the burden to his poor, suffering mother.
One of the basic principles of Islam is to relieve distress and hardship, so if a Muslim girl who is keen to remain chaste is exposed to bestial aggression and fears the effect that this may have on her reputation or her honour, or fears that she may be an outcast or that she may be subjected to harm such as being killed, or she fears that she may suffer psychological or nervous diseases, or that her sanity may be affected, or that shame may be brought upon her family for a matter in which she is not guilty of any sin, or that the child will not find any place of safety, then I say: that if this is the case, there is nothing wrong with her aborting the foetus before the soul is breathed into it, especially when it has become easy for a woman to find out if she is pregnant or not, with the advance of medical means of detecting pregnancy in the first week. The earlier the abortion is carried out, the more appropriate this concession is. And Allaah knows best.","From Ahkaam al-Janeen fi’l-Fiqh al-Islami, by ‘Umar ibn Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem Ghaanim"
13318,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13318,Ruling on setting up a recorder to watch over a relative’s conversations,"I have many brothers and sisters, so I use a telephone recording device to protect against wrongdoing and mischief. What do you think of this means, as this method has prevented wrongdoing in the past, noting that they are unaware of it?",,,"Praise be to Allah.This question was put to Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy
on him) and he said:
I think that this is a kind of spying
and it is not permissible for anyone to spy on anyone else, because we have no
right the judge anybody except by what is apparent. If we start spying on
people we will have a lot of headaches because of this spying and we will be
upset by what we hear and see. 
Allaah says
(interpretation of the meaning) “And spy not” [al-Hujuraat
49:12]
after saying (interpretation of the meaning), “O you who believe! Avoid much
suspicion; indeed some suspicions are sins. And spy not” [al-Hujuraat 49:12].
But if the head of the household sees indications
of these evil telephone calls, then there is nothing wrong with setting up a
recording device without their knowledge, but he realizes that there is
something going on, he should not keep quiet and keep listening, rather he
should rebuke them straightaway, because if he communities to listen,because he may hear
something that will upset him even more. For example, if he comes across a bad
telephone conversation, he must rebuke the one who is doing it straight away,
and not delay it until the next day; he must put a stop to it from the
beginning.
But with regard to mere suspicion
based on waswaas (insinuating whispers of the Shaytaan), it is not permitted (for him to set up this
device), but if he knows that the matter is serious and that it is actually
happening, then it is OK to set up a recorder so as to find out what is going on.",Fataawa Al-Liqa’ al-Shahri by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen no. 50
13319,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13319,Abortion after the soul has been breathed into the foetus,What is the ruling on abortion after the fifth month of pregnancy?,,,"Praise be to Allah.The fuqaha’ of the Sunni Islamic madhhabs are agreed that it is haraam to kill the foetus after the soul has been breathed into it, i.e., after 120 days have passed since conception. It is not permissible to kill it under any circumstances except when continuing the pregnancy would lead to the mother’s death. 
The differences among the fuqaha’ have to do with abortion in the period before the soul is breathed into the foetus. After the soul is breathed into it, the fuqaha’ are agreed that the foetus has become a human being and a soul which has dignity and is to be respected. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And indeed We have honoured the Children of Adam…”[al-Israa’ 17:70]
And He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“… if anyone killed a person not in retaliation of murder, or (and) to spread mischief in the land — it would be as if he killed all mankind, and if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of all mankind…”[al-Maa'idah 5:32]  
The Maaliki faqeeh Ibn Jizzi narrated in al-Qawaaneen al-Fiqhiyyah that there was scholarly consensus that it is haraam to have an abortion after the soul has been breathed into the foetus. He said: “When the womb has accepted the sperm it is haraam to interfere with it. It is worse (to do so) when it has been formed; and it is worse when the soul has been breathed into it, for that is considered to be the killing of a soul, according to scholarly consensus.” (al-Qawaaneen al-Fiqhiyyah, 141) 
Similarly it says in Nihaayat al-Muhtaaj: “The prohibition becomes stronger the closer the time is for the soul to be breathed into the foetus, because it is a crime. Then if it has taken on a human form and the midwives can palpate it, it must be protected fully.” (Nihaayat al-Muhtaaj, 8/442) 
The author of al-Bahr al-Raa’iq stated that when some of the features of the foetus become distinct, it is to be considered as a child. The author of al-Binaayah said: “It is not permitted to interfere with the foetus once its features have become distinct. If it can be distinguished from the ‘alaqah (clot) and the blood, it should be considered as having become a soul, and there is no doubt that the sanctity of the soul is protected by scholarly consensus and by the texts of the Qur’aan.” 
Thus it is clear to us that abortion after the soul has been breathed into the foetus is a crime which it is not permitted to commit, except in cases of extreme and certain necessity, not where necessity is merely imagined, i.e., where the necessity is proven. This means cases where preserving the foetus would put the mother’s life in danger, noting that with the advances in modern medicine and the scientific possibilities available nowadays, abortions performed to save the mother’s life have become very rare.",Ahkaam al-Janeen fi’l-Fiqh al-Islami by ‘Umar ibn Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem ‘Aamir
13331,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13331,Abortion of a foetus resulting from a zina relationship,Is it permissible for a woman who has committed immoral actions to abort the foetus?,,,"Praise be to Allah.The efforts and ijtihaad of 
          the fuqaha’ have focused on abortion in general terms, and the rulings 
          on that and the consequences that may follow. They have not gone into 
          details concerning cases where the pregnancy results from immorality. 
          This may be because they consider that to come under the same ruling 
          as abortion of a pregnancy resulting from a proper marriage. If abortion 
          of a pregnancy resulting from a proper marriage is haraam under normal 
          circumstances, then it is even more so in cases where the pregnancy 
          results from immorality, because permitting abortion of pregnancy which 
          results from immorality would encourage evil actions and the spread 
          of immorality. One of the basic principles of Islam is that it forbids 
          immorality and all the ways that lead to it, e.g., it forbids tabarruj 
          (wanton display of one’s charms) and free mixing (of men and women).
In addition, an innocent foetus 
          which has committed no sin should not be sacrificed because of a sin 
          committed by someone else. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
          
“No one laden with burdens 
          can bear another’s burden”
[al-Israa’ 17:15]
It is known that the Messenger 
          of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent the Ghaamidi woman 
          who was pregnant as a result of zinaa away until she gave birth, then 
          after the birth he sent her away until she had breastfed the child and 
          weaned him. She came back with the child who had a piece of bread. The 
          Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave the child to one of 
          the Muslims, then he gave orders that she should be placed in a hole 
          up to her chest, and commanded the people to stone her. Imaam al-Nawawi 
          said concerning this hadeeth: “A pregnant woman should not be stoned 
          until she gives birth, whether her pregnancy is the result of zina or 
          otherwise. This is agreed upon, lest her foetus be killed. The same 
          applies if her hadd punishment is flogging; a pregnant woman should 
          not be flogged, according to consensus, until she has given birth.” 
          (Saheeh Muslim bi Sharh al-Nawawi, 11/202)
This incident shows us the 
          extent to which Islam is concerned with the foetus, even if it is the 
          result of zina: the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) delayed the carrying out 
          of the hadd punishment on the mother in order to save the life 
          of the foetus.
Can it be imagined that the 
          Lawgiver would permit killing the foetuses by abortion in order to fulfil 
          the wishes of those who follow their whims and desires?
Furthermore, those who say 
          that abortion is permitted within the first forty days of a legitimate 
          pregnancy based their ijtihaad on a concession, like not fasting in 
          Ramadaan for those who have valid excuses, or shortening the four-rak’ah 
          prayers whilst travelling, but it is stated in sharee’ah that concessions 
          cannot be connected to sins. 
Imaam al-Quraafi said: “With 
          regard to sins, they cannot be taken as reasons for concessions. Hence 
          one who is travelling for the purpose of sin cannot shorten his prayers 
          or break his fast, because the reason for doing these is travelling, 
          but in this case the reason for travelling is to commit sin, so the 
          concession does not apply, because granting a concession on the basis 
          of sin will encourage people to sin further.” (al-Furooq, 2/33)
Similarly, the basic principles 
          of Islamic sharee’ah do not give the same concessions to a woman who 
          is pregnant as a result of zinaa as are given to a woman who is pregnant 
          as a result of proper marriage, lest that help her in her sin, and it 
          does not make it easy for her to get rid of the results of her evil 
          actions.
In addition, the foetus in the case of 
          zinaa has no guardian, because according to sharee’ah the title of father 
          can only be given to the one who has a child from a woman in a proper 
          marriage. This is part of the meaning of the hadeeth: “The child goes 
          to the owner of the bed and the adulterer gets nothing but the stones 
          (despair, i.e. to be stoned to death).” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari and 
          Muslim). The guardian of the foetus in such cases is the sultan or ruler 
          – the one who is in charge of the Muslims’ affairs – for he is the guardian 
          of those who have no guardian. The way in which the ruler disposes of 
          people’s affairs is based on the interests of the people, and there 
          is no interest to be served in destroying the soul of the foetus in 
          order to preserve the mother’s interests, because that would involve 
          encouraging her and others to persist in this evil action.","From Ahkaam al-Janeen fi’l-Fiqh al-Islami, by ‘Umar ibn Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem Ghaanim"

          al-Bayt, the best of Bani Haashim after the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It was proven that the 
          Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) threw his cloak over ‘Ali, 
          Faatimah, Hasan and Husayn and said, “O Allaah, these are the members 
          of my household, so to remove  Ar-Rijs (evil deeds and 
          sins) from them and purify them with a thorough purification [cf. al-Ahzaab 
          33:33].” 
 
          With regard to sending blessings exclusively upon him, 
          this issue leads us to another issue, which is whether it is permissible 
          to send blessings exclusively upon anyone other than the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), such as saying, “O Allaah 
          send blessings on ‘Umar, or ‘Ali (Allaahumma salli ‘ala ‘Umar 
          etc.)”. The scholars disputed concerning that. Maalik, al-Shaafa’i and 
          a group of the Hanbalis said that we should not send blessings exclusively 
          upon anyone except the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as it was narrated that 
          Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “I do not know that blessings should be sent upon 
          anyone except the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Imaam Ahmad and most of 
          his companions said that there was nothing wrong with that, because 
          ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib said to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, “May Allaah send 
          blessings upon you.” This is the more correct view. But singling out 
          one of the Sahaabah or relatives of the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), such as ‘Ali, or anyone 
          else, to send blessings upon them, is a form of making them rival the 
          Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), in such a way that this 
          phrase becomes like a symbol or slogan that is attached to his name, 
          this is what is bid’ah.","Al-Fataawa al-Kubra, 1/56"
13337,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13337,Do You Need to Utter Intention for Acts of Worship?,"Should a Muslim utter the intention (Niyyah) when he starts to do an act of worship, such as saying, “I intend to do Wudu’”, “I intend to pray”, “I intend to fast” and so on?","According to the consensus of scholars, the intention of doing Wudu or Ghusl, of praying, fasting, paying Zakah, and other acts of worship does not need to be uttered verbally. Rather the place of intention is the heart.",,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the intention when starting to do an act of worship such as praying etc., do we need to utter it verbally, such as saying, “I intend to pray, I intend to fast”? 
He (may Allah have mercy on him) replied: 
“The intention of purifying oneself by doing Wudu, Ghusl or Tayammum, of praying, fasting , paying Zakah, offering expiation and other acts of worship does not need to be uttered verbally, according to the consensus of the Imams of Islam. Rather the place of intention is the heart, according to the consensus among them. If a person utters something by mistake that goes against what is in his heart, then what counts is what he intended, not what he said. 
No one has mentioned any difference of opinion concerning this matter, except that some of the later followers of Ash-Shafi`i expressed approval of that, but some of the leaders of this Madhhab said that this was wrong. But in the dispute among the scholars as to whether it is recommended to utter one’s intention, there are two points of view. Some of the companions of Abu Hanifah, Ash-Shafi`i and Ahmad said that it is recommended to utter the intention so as to make it stronger. 
Some of the companions of Malik, Ahmad and others said that it is not recommended to utter it, because that is an innovation. It was not narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or his Companions did it or that he commanded anyone among his Ummah to utter the intention. That is not known from any of the Muslims. If that had been prescribed then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his Companions would not have neglected it, as it has to do with worship which the Ummah does every day and night. 
This is the more correct view. Indeed, uttering the intention is an irrational thinking and falling short in religious commitment. In terms of falling short in religious commitment, that is because it is an innovation. 
In terms of irrational thinking, that is because it is like a person who wants to eat some food saying, “I intend to put my hand in this vessel, take out a morsel of food, put it in my mouth and chew it, then swallow it, and eat until I have had my fill.” This is sheer foolishness and ignorance. 
Intention is connected to knowledge. If a person knows what he is doing, then he has obviously made an intention. It cannot be imagined, if he knows what he wants to do, that he has not formed an intention.
The Imams agreed that speaking the intention out loud and repeating it is not prescribed in Islam, rather the person who has made this a habit should be disciplined and told not to worship Allah by following Bid`ah and not to disturb others by raising his voice.

13340,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13340,Description of the Prophet’s Prayer,How did Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) pray?,"When Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood up to pray, he used to face the Ka`bah in a standing position, then say ‘Allahu Akbar’, then recite Al-Fatihah, then recite another surah, then make ruku`, then raise up from ruku`, then make sujud, then raise up from sujud, then make a second sujud, then stand up to make the second rak`ah.","Facing the direction of the Ka`bah 


Qiyam (standing in prayer) 


Niyyah (intention) 


Takbir 


Ruku` (bowing) 


Sujud (prostration)","Praise be to Allah.Facing the direction of the Ka`bah 

When you stand up to pray, face the direction of the Ka`bah wherever you are, in both fard (obligatory) and nafl (supererogatory) prayers. This is one of the pillars of prayer , without which prayer is not valid.
The obligation of facing the direction of prayer does not apply to one who is engaged in warfare, when he prays the fear prayer (salat al-khawf) or is engaged in heavy fighting. It also does not apply to those who are unable to do it, such as one who is sick, or one who is traveling on a ship, in a car or on a plane, if they fear that the time of the prayer will elapse (before they reach a place where they can find the correct direction). And it does not apply to one who is praying a nafl prayer or witr prayer whilst riding on a riding-animal etc., but it is mustahabb for him to face the qiblah if he is able to do so when pronouncing the takbir of ihram (at the beginning of the prayer), then he may face whatever direction he is facing.
Everyone who can see the Ka`bah must face it; those who cannot see it must face its direction. 


Ruling on not facing the Ka`bah in prayer by mistake 


If a person prays not facing the qiblah, because of clouds [preventing him from working out the direction from the position of the sun] or some other reason, after he did his best to work out the right direction, his prayer is valid and he does not have to repeat it.
If someone whom he trusts comes – whilst he is praying – and tells him of the right direction, then he must hasten to turn that way, and his prayer is valid. 

Qiyam (standing in prayer) 

It is obligatory to pray standing. This is a pillar (essential part of prayer), except for the one who is praying the fear prayer or at times of intense fighting, when it is permitted to pray whilst riding; for the one who is sick and unable to stand, he should pray sitting if he is able, otherwise lying on his side; and the one who is praying a nafl prayer, he may pray whilst riding or sitting if he wishes, and he indicates the ruku` and sujud with his head. The one who is sick may also do this, and he should make his sujud lower than his ruku`.
It is not permissible for one who is praying sitting down to put something raised up on the ground in order to prostrate on it. Rather he should make his sujud lower than his ruku` – as we have mentioned – if he is unable to touch the ground directly with his forehead. 


Prayer on board a ship or airplane


It is permissible to pray fard prayers on board a ship or airplane.
It is permissible to pray them sitting down if one fears that one may fall.
It is permissible to lean on a pillar or stick when standing, if one is old or weak in body. 


Combining standing and sitting in prayer 


It is permissible to pray qiyam al-layl standing or sitting with no excuse, or to do both. So a person may pray and recite sitting down, and just before doing ruku` he may stand up and recite the rest of the ayahs standing up, then do ruku` and sujud, then he can do likewise in the second rak`ah.
If he prays sitting down, he should pray sitting cross-legged or in whatever position he finds comfortable.  


Praying wearing shoes  


It is permissible to pray barefoot, or to pray wearing shoes.
It is better to pray sometimes barefoot and sometimes wearing shoes, according to what is easy; one should not make it difficult to put shoes on or to take them off in order to pray. If a person is barefoot, he should pray barefoot and if he is wearing shoes then he should pray wearing shoes, except when there is a reason not to do so.
If he takes them off, then he should not place them to his right; rather he should place them to his left, if there is no one on his left, otherwise he should put them between his feet. There is a subtle hint that he should not place them in front of himself. This is the etiquette which most worshippers ignore, so you see them praying facing their shoes! This is what was narrated in the sahih reports from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 


Praying on the minbar 


It is permissible for the imam to pray on an elevated place such as the minbar, in order to teach the people. So he should stand up on it to pray, then say takbir, recite Quran and do ruku` whilst he is on that place, then he should come down backwards so that he can prostrate on the ground at the base of the minbar, then he may go back to it and do the same in the second rak`ah as he did in the first. 


It is obligatory to pray facing a sutrah and be close to it 


It is obligatory to pray facing a sutrah (screen or cover), there is no difference whether that is in the mosque or elsewhere, whether the mosque is big or small, because of the general meaning of the hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Do not pray except facing a sutrah, and do not let anyone pass in front of you, and if he insists then fight him, for he has a companion (qarin) with him” – meaning the Shaytan.
It is obligatory to be close to the sutrah, because this is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded.
Between the place where the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prostrated and the wall there would be a space nearly big enough for a sheep to pass through. Whoever does that is close enough [to the sutrah] as is required. I say: from this we know that what people do in all the mosques that I have seen in Syria and elsewhere, by praying in the middle of the mosque far away from the wall or pillars is but negligence towards the command and action of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 


How high should the sutrah be? 


The sutrah should be approximately a handspan or two above the ground, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When one of you places in front of him something such as the stick on the end of a saddle, he should pray and not worry about anyone who passes in front of that.” This hadith indicates that a line on the ground is not sufficient, and the hadith narrated concerning that is da’if (weak).
He should face the sutrah directly, because this is the apparent meaning of the command to pray towards the sutrah. Stepping slightly to the right or left so that one is not facing it directly, is not correct.
It is permissible to pray facing a stick planted in the ground and the like, or a tree, or a pillar, or one’s wife lying down in bed underneath her blanket, or an animal, even if it is a camel. 


Prohibition of praying towards graves 


It is not permitted to pray facing graves at all, whether they are the grave of prophets or of others. 


Prohibition of walking in front of one who is praying even in al-Masjid al-Haram 


It is not permitted to walk in front of one who is praying if there is a sutrah in front of him [i.e., it is not permissible to come between him and his sutrah]. There is no difference in this regard between al-Masjid al-Haram and other mosques, all of them are the same in that this [walking in front of one who is praying] is not permitted, because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “If the person who passes in front of one who is praying knew how great a burden of sin resulted from that, standing for forty [years] would be better for him than passing in front of one who is praying.” This refers to passing between him and the place of his prostration. The hadith which speaks of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) praying in Hashiyat al-Mataf without a sutrah and with people passing in front of him is not sahih, even though it does not say that they were passing between him and his place of prostration. It is obligatory for the one who is prostrating to prevent the one who wants to pass in front of him, even in Masjid al-Haram.
It is not permissible for the one who is praying towards a sutrah to let anyone pass in front of him, because of the hadith quoted above, “Do not let anyone pass in front of you…” And because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When one of you is praying towards something which is a sutrah between him and the people, and someone wants to pass in front of him, then he should push him in the upper chest and repel him as much as he can.” According to another report: “… he should stop him twice, but if he insists then he should fight him, for he is a devil.” 


Stepping forward to prevent someone passing in front of him 


It is permissible for a person to take one or two steps to the front, in order to prevent one who is not responsible from passing in front of him, such as an animal or a small child, and to make them pass behind him. 


What breaks prayer 


The sutrah is so important to prayer that it prevents a person’s prayer from being invalidated, if someone passes in front of him. This is in contrast to the one who does not use a sutrah, whose prayer is broken if an adult woman, a donkey or a black dog passes in front of him.  

Niyyah (intention) 

The worshipper must have the intention of praying the prayer for which he is standing. He must have the intention in his heart of performing a specific prayer, such as the fard (obligatory prayer) of Zuhr or of ‘Asr, or the Sunnah of those prayers. This is a condition or pillar (essential part) of the prayer, but uttering the intention verbally is a bid’ah which goes against the Sunnah, which was not suggested by any of the imams who are followed. 

Takbir 

Then he should start the prayer by saying “Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great).” This is an essential part of the prayer, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The key to prayer is purifying oneself (wudu’), it is entered by takbir (saying ‘Allahu akbar’) and exited by taslim (saying ‘al-salamu ‘alaykum’)” i.e, once you say takbir, certain things are prohibited and this prohibition ends when you say taslim.
He should not raise his voice when saying takbir in all the prayers, unless he is acting as an imam.
It is permissible for the muadhdhin to convey the takbir of the imam to the people, if there is a need to do so, such as if the imam is sick and his voice is weak, or because there are many worshippers praying behind him.
The one who is following the imam should not say takbir until the imam has finished saying takbir. 


Raising the hands – how it is to be done 


He should raise his hands when saying the takbir, or before or after doing so. All of these are proven in the Sunnah.
He should raise them with the fingers stretched out.
He should raise them level with his shoulders, or sometimes until they are level with his earlobes. I say: with regard to touching the earlobes with the thumbs, there is no basis for this in the Sunnah, rather in my view this has to do with waswas (insinuating whispers of the Shaytan).                                            


Placing the hands – how it is to be done 


Then he should place his right hand on his left, immediately after the takbir. This is the way of the prophets (peace be upon them), and this is what the Messenger of Allah  (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined upon his Companions. It is not permissible to let the arms hang at the sides.
The right hand should be placed on the back of the left hand, wrist and forearm.
Sometimes the left hand may be grasped with the right. The combination of placing and grasping, which was favoured by some later scholars, has no basis.  


Where they should be placed 


The hands should be placed on the chest only; there is no difference between men and women in this regard. I say: placing them anywhere other than on the chest is da’if (weak) or has no basis.
It is not permissible to put the right hand on the waist. 


Humility and looking at the place of prostration 


The worshipper must be humble in his prayer, and should avoid everything that may distract him from it, such as adornments and decorations. He should not pray where there is food that he wants to eat, or when he needs to urinate or defecate.
Whilst he is standing, he should look towards the place where he will prostrate.
He should not look to the right or the left, because looking here and there is a snatching away which the Shaytan steals from the prayer of the slave.
It is not permissible for him to look up at the sky. 


Du`a al-Istiftah (du`a at the start of prayer) 


Then he should start the prayer with some of the du`as which are narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). There are many of these, the most famous of which is “Subhanaka Allahumma wa bihamdika, wa tabaraka ismuka wa ta'ala jadduka, wa la ilaha ghayruka (Glory and praise be to You O Allah, blessed be Your name and exalted be Your Majesty, and there is no god but You).” The command to do this is proven so we should adhere to it. Whoever wants to see the other du`as may refer to Sifat al-Salah, p. 91-95, Maktabat al-Ma’arif, Riyadh, edition. [In English, see “The Prophet’s Prayer described” by Shaykh al-Albani, al-Hanif Publications, p. 14-19] 


Recitation of Quran 


Then he should seek refuge with Allah – this is obligatory, and he is sinning if he omits to do so.
The Sunnah is sometimes to say “A’udhu Billahi min al-Shaytan ir-rajim, min hamzihi wa nafkhihi wa nafathihi (I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Satan, from his madness, his arrogance and his poetry),” – poetry here refers to blameworthy kinds of poetry.
And sometimes he may say, “A’udhu Billah is-Sami’ il-A’lieem min al-Shaytan… (I seek refuge with Allah, the All-Hearing, All-Knowing, from the Shaytan…).”
Then he should say silently – whether the prayer is to be recited aloud or silently – “Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Rahim (In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful).” 


Reciting al-Fatihah 


Then he should recite Surat al-Fatihah (the first surah of the Quran) in full, including the Basmalah (Bismillahi ar-Rahman ar-Rahim). This is an essential part of the prayer, without which the prayer is not valid. Those who do not speak Arabic must memorize this surah.
Those who cannot remember it should say: “Subhan Allah, wa’l-hamdu-Lillah, wa la ilaha ill-Allah, wa Allahu akbar, wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah (Glory be to Allah, praise be to Allah, there is no god but Allah, Allah is Most Great, and there is no strength and no power except with Allah).”
The Sunnah is to recite it one verse at a time, and to pause at the beginning of each ayah. So he should say: “Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Rahim (In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful),” then pause. Then say, “Al-Hamdu Lillahi Rabb il-‘Alamin (All the praises and thanks be to Allâh, the Lord of the ‘Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists), then pause. Then say: ‘al-Rahman ar-Rahim (The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful), then pause… and so on, until the end of the surah.

This is how the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite the whole surah, pausing at the end of each ayah and not joining one ayah to the next, even if there is continuity of the meaning.

It is permissible to read it as Maliki Yawn id-Din or Maaliki Yawm id-Din. 


How the one who is praying behind the imam should recite it 


The one who is praying behind the imam should recite it behind the imam in prayers where Quran in recited silently and in prayers where it is recited aloud, if he cannot hear the imam’s recitation, or if he pauses after completing it so that those who are praying behind him can recite it. We think that this pause was not proven in the Sunnah. I say I have mentioned the evidence of those who think that this pause is permissible and the refutation of that evidence, in Silsilat al-Ahadith al-Da’ifah, no. 546, 547, part 2, p. 24-26, Dar al-Ma’arif edition. 


Recitation after al-Fatihah 


It is Sunnah to recite – after al-Fatihah – another surah , even in Salat al-Janazah (funeral prayer), or some ayahs, in the first two rak`ahs.
The recitation may be made lengthy sometimes , and shorter sometimes, for reasons of travel, coughing, sickness or the crying of an infant.
The recitation varies according to the prayers. The recitation in Fajr prayer is longer than it is in all the other prayers. Next longest is Zuhr, then ‘Asr, then ‘Isha, then Maghrib, usually.
The recitation in the night prayers (qiyam al-layl ) is longer than all of these.
The Sunnah is to make the recitation longer in the first rak`ah than in the second.
He should make the recitation in the last two shorter than in the first two rak`ahs, half the length. If you want more details on this topic, see Sifat al-Salah p. 102 (Arabic original). 


Reciting al-Fatihah in every rak`ah 


It is obligatory to recite al-Fatihah in every rak`ah.
It is Sunnah to add to it in the last two rak`ahs as well.
It is not permissible for the imam to make his recitation longer than that which is described in the Sunnah, because that is difficult for those who may be praying behind him, such as the elderly and sick, or nursing mothers, or those who have other things to do. 


Reciting aloud and reciting quietly 


Quran should be recited aloud in Fajr and Jumu’ah prayers, ‘Eid prayers, prayers for rain (istisqa), prayers at the time of an eclipse (kusuf) and in the first two rak`ahs of Maghrib and ‘Isha.

He should recite silently in the first two rak`ahs of Zuhr and ‘Asr, in the third rak`ah of Maghrib and in the last two rak`ahs of ‘Isha.

It is permissible for the imam occasionally to make an ayah audible in the prayers where recitation is to be done silently.
In Witr and Qiyam al-Layl, he should recite silently sometimes and aloud sometimes, and he should be moderate in raising his voice. 


Tartil – reciting at a measured pace 


The Sunnah is to recite the Quran at a measured pace, not quickly or hastily. It should be read in a manner that clearly distinguishes each letter, beautifying the Quran with one’s voice. He should observe the well known rulings of the scholars of Tajwid and he should not recite it in the innovated manner of singers or according to the rules of music. 


Prompting the imam 


It is prescribed for the one who is praying behind the imam to prompt the imam if he hesitates in his recitation.  

Ruku` (bowing) 

When he has completed the recitation, he should pause briefly, to catch his breath.
Then he should raise his hands in the manner described for takbirat al-ihram (the takbir at the beginning of prayer).
And he should say takbir (“Allahu akbar”). This is obligatory.
Then he should do ruku`, bowing as deeply as his joints will let him, until his joints take the new position and are relaxed in it. This is an essential part of prayer. 


How to do ruku` 


He should put his hands on his knees, firmly, spacing the fingers out, as if he is grasping his knees.
He should spread his back and make it level so that if water were poured on it, it would stay there (not run off).
He should not lower or raise his head, but make it level with his back.
He should keep his elbows away from his sides.
In ruku`, he should say “Subhana Rabbiy al-‘Azim (Glory be to my Lord, the Almighty) three times or more. There are other kinds of dhikr which may be said in ruku`, some of which are long, some of medium length and some short. See Sifat Salat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), p. 132, Maktabat al-Ma’arif edition [The Prophet’s Prayer Described, p. 44]. 


Making the essential parts of prayer equal in length  


It is Sunnah to make the essential parts of prayer equal in length, so the ruku`, the standing after ruku`, the prostration and the sitting between the two prostrations should be made approximately the same in length.
It is not permissible to recite Quran in ruku` or in sujud. 


Straightening up from ruku` 


Then he should straighten up from ruku`. This is an essential part of the prayer.
Whilst straightening up, he should say, “Sami’a Allahu liman hamidah (Allah listens to the one who praises Him).” This is obligatory.
He should raise his hands when straightening up, in the manner described above.
Then he should stand straight until every vertebra has returned to its place. This is an essential part of the prayer.
Whilst standing thus, he should say, “Rabbana wa laka al-hamd (our Lord, to You be all praise).” (There are other kinds of dhikr which may be said at this point. See Sifat al-Salah, p. 135/The Prophet’s prayer described, p. 47). This is obligatory for every person who is praying, even if he is following an imam, because this is the dhikr of standing after ruku`, and saying “Sami’a Allahu liman hamidah” is the dhikr of straightening up from ruku`. It is not prescribed to put the hands one over the other during this standing, because this was not narrated (from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)). For more details, see Sifat Salat al-Nabi, 1 – Istiqbal al-Qiblah (The Prophet’s Prayer Described – Facing the Ka`bah).
He should make this standing equal in length to the ruku`, as stated above. 

Sujud (prostration) 

Then he should say “Allahu akbar” – this is obligatory.
He should raise his hands sometimes. 


Going down on the hands 


Then he should go down into sujud on his hands, putting them down before the knees. This is what was commanded by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and it is proven that he did this, and he forbade imitating the manner in which a camel sits down, which is by kneeling with its forelegs first. 
When he prostrates – which is an essential part of the prayer – he should put his weight on his palms and spread them out.
He should keep the fingers together.
And point the fingers towards the qiblah.
He should put his palms level with his shoulders.
Sometimes he should make them level with his ears.
He should keep his forearms off the ground. This is obligatory. He should not spread them along the ground like a dog.
He should place his nose and forehead firmly on the ground. This is an essential part of the prayer.
He should also place his knees firmly on the ground.
The same applies to his toes.
He should hold his feet upright with his toes touching the ground. All of this is obligatory.
He should make his toes point in the direction of the qiblah.
He should put his heels together. 


Being at ease in sujud 


He should be at ease in sujud, distributing his weight equally on the parts of the body which should be in contact with the ground during sujud. They are: the nose and forehead, the palms, the knees, and the toes.
Whoever is at ease in his sujud in this manner has got it right. And this being at ease is also an essential part of the prayer.
In sujud, he should say, “Subhana Rabbiy al-‘A’la (Glory be to my Lord Most High)” three times or more. (There are other kinds of dhikr also, see Sifat Salat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), p. 145/The Prophet’s Prayer described, p. 55).
It is mustahaab to offer a lot of du`a during sujud, because it is a time when du`a is likely to be answered.
He should make his sujud almost as long as his ruku`, as described above.
It is permissible to prostrate on the bare ground, or on something covering the ground such as a garment or carpet, or a mat, etc.
It is not permitted to recite Quran whilst prostrating. 


Iftirash and Iq’a between the two sajdahs 

[Iftirash means sitting on the left thigh with the right foot upwards and its toes pointed towards the qiblah; iq’a means resting on both heels and feet] 

Then he should raise his head, saying takbir. This is obligatory.
He should raise his hands sometimes.
Then he should sit at ease, until every vertebra returns to its place. This is obligatory.
He should spread his left leg and sit on it. This is obligatory.
He should put his right foot upright.
And make its toes point towards the qiblah.
It is permissible to sit in iq’a sometimes, which means resting on the heels and feet.
Whilst sitting thus, he should say, “Allahumma ighfir li warhamni wajburni, warfa’ni, wa’afini warzuqni (O Allah, forgive me, have mercy on me, strengthen me, raise me in status, pardon me and grant me provision).”
If he wishes, he may say, “Rabbi ighfir li, Rabbi ighfir li (My Lord, forgive me, my Lord, forgive me).”
He should make this sitting almost as long as his sujud.  


The second sajdah 


Then he should say takbir – this is obligatory,
He should raise his hands sometimes when saying this takbir.
He should do the second prostration – this is also an essential part of the prayer.
He should do in the second prostration what he did in the first. 


The sitting of rest 


When he raises his head from the second prostration and he wants to get up for the second rak`ah, he should say takbir. This is obligatory.
He should raise his hands sometimes.
He should sit up straight, sitting on his left foot, until every bone returns to its place. 


The second rak`ah 


Then he should get up for the second rak`ah, supporting himself on his hands with his fists clenched as if kneading dough. This is an essential part of the prayer.
He should do in the second rak`ah what he did in the first.
Except that he should not recite the du`a for starting the prayer.
He should make it shorter than the first rak`ah. 


Sitting for the Tashahhud 


When he completes the second rak`ah, he should sit for the Tashahhud . This is obligatory.
He should sit in iftirash, as described above for the sitting between the two prostrations.
But it is not permitted to sit in iq’a at this point.
He should put his right hand on his right thigh and knee, and the end of the right elbow on the thigh, not far from it.
He should spread his left palm on his left thigh and knee.
It is not permissible to sit resting on one’s arms, especially the left arm. 


Moving the finger  and looking at it 


He should clench all the fingers of his right hand, and put the thumb on the middle finger sometimes.
Sometimes he should make a circle with them.
He should point with his index finger towards the qiblah.
He should look towards it.
He should move it, making du`a with it, from the beginning of the Tashahhud until the end.
He should not point with the finger of his left hand.
He should do all of this in every Tashahhud. 


How to say Tashahhud and the du`a following it 


The Tashahhud is obligatory, and if he forgets it, he must do the two prostrations of forgetfulness (sajdat al-sahw).
He should recite it silently.
The wording of the Tashahhud is: “Al-tahiyyatu Lillahi wa’l-salaawatu wa’l-tayyibat. Al-salamu ‘alayka ayyuha’l-Nabiyyu wa rahmat-Allahi wa barakatuhu. Al-salamu ‘alayna wa ‘ala ‘ibad-Illah il-salihin. Ash-hadu an la ilaha ill-Allah wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan ‘abduhu wa rasuluhu (All compliments, prayers and pure words are due to Allah. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy and blessings of Allah. Peace be upon us and upon the righteous slaves of Allah. I bear witness that there is no god except Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the slave and Messenger of Allah).” [Other versions are mentioned in Sifat Salat al-Nabi/The Prophet’s Prayer Described, but what is mentioned here is the most sound].

Sending salams upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): this is what was prescribed after the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and is narrated in the Tashahhud of Ibn Mas’ud, ‘Aishah and Ibn al-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with them). For more details see Sifat Salat al-Nabi, p. 161, Maktabat al-Ma’arif, Riyadh, edition/ The Prophet’s Prayer Described, p. 67).

After that, he should send prayers upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), by saying: “Allahumma salli ‘ala Muhammad wa ‘ala ali Muhammad kama salayta ‘ala Ibrahim wa ‘ala ali Ibrahim, innaka hamidun majid. Allahumma barik ‘ala Muhammad wa ‘ala ali Muhammad kama barakta ‘ala Ibrahim wa ‘ala ali Ibrahim, innak hamidun majid (O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent prayers upon Ibrahim and upon the family of Ibrahim; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory. O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad as You sent blessings upon Ibrahim and upon the family of Ibrahim); You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory).”
If you wish you may shorten it and say: “Allahumma salli ‘ala Muhammad wa ‘ala ali Muhammad, wa barik ‘ala Muhammad wa ‘ala ali Muhammad, kama salayta wa barakta ‘ala Ibrahim wa ‘ala ali Ibrahim, innaka hamidun majid (O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and send blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, as You sent prayers and blessings upon Ibrahim and the family of Ibrahim; You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory).”
Then in this Tashahhud he may choose any of the du`as that he likes of those that have been narrated, and call upon Allah using these words. 


The third and fourth rak`ahs 


Then he says takbir – which is obligatory. The Sunnah is to say takbir whilst still sitting.
He should raise his hands sometimes.
Then he should stand up for the third rak`ah, which is an essential part of prayer, as is the following rak`ah.
He should do likewise if he wants to get up for the fourth rak`ah.
But before he gets up, he should sit up straight, by adjusting his left leg, until every bone returns to its place.
Then he should get up, supporting himself on his hands, as he did when getting up for the second rak`ah.
Then in the third and fourth rak`ahs, he should recite al-Fatihah. This is obligatory.
He may add an ayah or more to that occasionally. 


Reciting Al-Qunut  when calamity strikes 


It is Sunnah to recite Qunut and pray for the Muslims when any disaster befalls them.
Qunut should be recited after standing up from ruku` and saying “Rabbana wa laka’l-hamd (Our Lord, to You be praise).”
There is no specific du`a to be recited regularly in Qunut, rather one should recite whatever is appropriate when disaster strikes.
He should raise his hands when reciting this du`a
He should recite it aloud if he is acting as an imam.
Those who are praying behind him should say “Amin” to this du`a.
When he has finished, he should say takbir and prostrate. 


Qunut al-Wit – when it is to be recited, and what wording it should have 


Qunut in Witr is prescribed occasionally.
It should be recited before ruku`, unlike Qunut recited at times of calamity.
He should recite the following words:

“Allahumma ihdini fiman hadayta, wa ‘afini fiman ‘afayta, wa tawallani fiman tawallayta, wa barik li fima a’tayta, wa qini sharra ma qadayta, fa innaka taqdi wa la yuqda ‘alayk, wa innahu la yadhillu man walayta, wa la ya’izzu man ‘adayta, tabarakta rabbana wa ta’alayta, wa la manja minka illa ilayk
(O Allah, guide me amongst those whom You have guided; pardon me amongst those whom You have pardoned; turn to me in friendship amongst those to whom You have turned in friendship; bless me in what You have bestowed; save me from the evil of what You have decreed; for indeed You decree, and none can influence You; and he is not humiliated whom You have befriended; nor is he honoured whom You take as Your enemy. Blessed are You, O Lord, and exalted. There is no place of safety from You except towards You).”

This du`a was taught by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so it is permissible, because it was narrated from the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them).
Then he should do ruku`, and the two prostrations, as before. 


The final Tashahhud and placing the left foot under the right leg


Then he should sit for the final Tashahhud. This is obligatory.
He should do the same as in the first Tashahhud.
But he should sit mutawarikan, which means placing the left foot under his right leg.
He should put his right foot upright.
It is also permissible to lay the right foot along the ground sometimes.
He should cover his left knee with his left palm, leaning heavily on it. 


The obligation of sending prayers upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and of seeking refuge with Allah from four things 


It is obligatory for him in this Tashahhud to send prayers upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), some versions of which we have quoted above when discussing the first Tashahhud.
He should also seek refuge with Allah from four things and say: “Allahumma inni a’udhu bika min ‘adhab Jahannam wa min ‘adhab al-qabri wa min fitnat il-mahya wa’l-mamat, wa min sharri fitnat il-masih al-dajjal (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the torment of Hell, from the torment of the grave, from the trials of life and death and from the evil of the tribulation of the Dajjal).”

The trials of life means the temptations of this world and its desires which a person faces in his life. The trials of death means the torment of the grave and the questioning of the two angels. The tribulation of the Dajjal means the extraordinary feats that will be done at his hands, by which means people will be led astray, and they will follow him and believe his claim to be divine. 

Du`a before the salam 


Then he may pray for himself as he sees fit, as narrated in the Quran and Sunnah. There are many such good du`as. If he does not know any such du`as then he can say whatever is easy for him, for things that will benefit him in his religion and in his worldly affairs. 


Various kinds of taslim (saying salams) 


Then he should say salams to his right, which is an essential part of the prayer, turning his face so that the whiteness of his right cheek may be seen (from behind).
Then he should say salams to his left, turning his face so that the whiteness of his left cheek may be seen, even in the funeral prayer
The imam should raise his voice when saying salam, except in the funeral prayer.
The salam takes various forms:


“Al-Salamu ‘alaykum wa rahmat-Allahi wa barakatuhu” to the right, and “Al-salamu ‘alaaykum wa rahmat-Allah” to the left.
The same, but without saying “wa barakatuhu”.
“Al-Salamu ‘alaykum wa rahmat-Allahu” to the right, and “Al-salamu ‘alaykum” to the left.
Saying one salam, tilting the head slightly to the right. 

O my Muslim brother, this is what I was able to summarize from Sifat Salat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) [The Prophet’s Prayer Described], in an attempt to make it more accessible to you, so that it would be clear to you, as if you could see it with your own eyes. If you pray in the manner described to you of how the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), prayed, then I hope that Allah will accept that from you, because by doing that you will have truly put into practice the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Pray as you have seen me pray.” 
Moreover you must not forget the importance of presence of mind and humility in prayer, for this is the ultimate purpose of standing before Allah in prayer. The more you can develop the attitude of humility and submission in prayer as described to you in the prayer of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the more benefits you will reap, as indicated by our Lord when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, As-Salat (the prayer) prevents from Al-Fahsha (i.e. great sins of every kind, unlawful sexual intercourse) and Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism, and every kind of evil wicked deed).” [Al-‘Ankabut 29:45] 
Finally, I ask Allah to accept our prayer and all our good deeds, and to store up their reward until the Day when we meet Him: 
“The Day whereon neither wealth nor sons will avail, Except him who brings to Allah a clean heart [clean from Shirk (polytheism) and Nifaq (hypocrisy)].” [Al-Shu’ara 26:88 – interpretation of the meaning]

13341,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13341,Selling a product at different prices to different customers,"A brother works in a Muslim Shoe store. However the owners frequently change the price on the items.
Example, for person A, the item may cost $50 and for person B it would be $90 even though the true price of the item (labelled on it) is $ 60.
Is it permissable to change prices like this? Is this fair trade?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The vendor should sell the item for the price for which it is sold in the marketplace; if he sells it for a price different from that for which it is sold in the marketplace, one of two scenarios must apply: 
1 – He sells it for less than its market value, such as if he wants to do a favour for one of his friends. This is permissible and there is nothing wrong with it, and the seller should not be stopped from doing that unless he intends to cause harm to other merchants, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There should be neither harming no reciprocating harm.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 2340; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Irwa’, 896. 
2 – He sells it for more than the market value. If he sells it for slightly more, such as selling something that is worth twenty for twenty-two, then this is permissible because it is something that usually happens and people tolerate it. 
But if the price is greatly increased, and the purchaser does not know the usual price – such as if he sells something that is usually worth sixty for ninety, as mentioned in the question – then this is not permissible, and is a kind of cheating and deception. In this case the purchaser has the option, if he is told of the situation, of returning the goods.  
See al-Mughni, 4/18 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
What is the ruling on merchants who sell things for different prices to different people, even though it is the same product? So he sells it to one person for ten, to another for twenty, and to a third for five? Is this permissible or not? 
He replied: 
If this variation is caused by fluctuations in the market, or the price of this product goes up one day and down the next, then there is nothing wrong with selling it at the market price, and there is nothing haraam in that. But if this variation occurs because of the purchaser’s skill in bargaining – so if he sees that he is not clever in bargaining he will increase the price, and if he sees that he is clever in bargaining then he will give him a lower price – then this is not permissible, because it is a kind of deception and insincerity. It was proven in the hadeeth of Tameem al-Daari that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Religion is sincerity.” It was said: “To whom, O Messenger of Allah?” He said: “To Allah, to His Book, to His Messenger, to the leaders of the Muslims and to their common folk.” Narrated by Muslim, 55. 
Just as he would not like anyone else to do that to him, how can he agree to do that to his Muslim brothers? One should sell according to the normal prices in the place where he is doing business, and not give one price to one person and one price to another, because of the gullibility of the buyer.
 But if he does a favour to some of his friends by lowering the price, there is nothing wrong with that and no sin on him, or if he sells the goods at the market price, then another man comes along who is skilled in bargaining and he lowers the price for him, there is nothing wrong with that, because that does not go beyond the normal price. Fatawa li’l-Tujjaar wa Rijaal al-A’maal, p. 42

          Taking pictures of women is not permitted at all, because 
          of the temptation and evil that results from that, in addition to the 
          fact that taking pictures is forbidden in and of itself. So it is not 
          permissible to take pictures of women when traveling or for any other 
          reason. The Council of Senior Scholars has issued a statement that this 
          is haraam. With regard to traveling to kaafir countries or permissive 
          countries, this is not permitted because it involves temptation and 
          evil, and mixing with the kaafirs, and seeing evil things and being 
          affected by that. It is only permitted within strict guidelines which 
          have been set out by the scholars, namely:
 
          1-For necessary medical treatment 
          which cannot be found in any Muslim country
 
          2-For business purposes which 
          require travel

          In each of these cases, there is the condition that the 
          traveler should be able to practise his religion openly and show pride 
          in his beliefs, and keep away from places of temptation.
 
          With regard to traveling solely for the purpose of a pleasure trip, or for a break, this is emphatically forbidden.

Is this information correct? .",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The scholars differ concerning the number of wives that the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had. The majority 
    are of the view – which is correct – that he had eleven wives with whom he 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) consummated marriage, and 
    he left nine of them behind when he died. Khadeejah bint Khuwaylid and 
    Zaynab bint Khuzaymah – may Allaah be pleased with them both – died before 
    him  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 

    This is the view of his companions, as the imams narrated 
    from them in their saheeh books. 

    It was narrated from Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) 
    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to go 
    around his wives in a single night, and he had nine wives. Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 280. 

    Mu’aadh ibn Hishaam narrated from his father, according to a 
    report narrated by al-Bukhaari (265) from him alone, that there were eleven 
    wives, but he was mistaken; the correct view is that he went around to nine 
    wives. 

    Ibn Hajar said: 

    Ibn Khuzaymah said: Mu’aadh ibn Hishaam was the only one who 
    narrated that from his father, and it was narrated by Sa’eed ibn ‘Uroobah 
    and others from Qataadah but they said “nine wives.” Al-Bukhaari referred to 
    the report of Sa’eed ibn Abi ‘Uroobah in a mu’allaq report here, but twenty 
    chapters later he narrated it in a mawsool report when he said: “He used to 
    go around his wives in one night, and at that time he had nine wives.” 

    Fath al-Baari, 1/377. 
It was 
    narrated that ‘Ata’ said: We, along with Ibn ‘Abbaas, attended the funeral 
    of Maymoonah in Sarif. Ibn ‘Abbaas said: This is the wife of the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). When you lift up her bier, 
    do not shake it or rock it; be gentle, for the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) had nine wives and he used to give a 
    portion of his time to eight and not to one.

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4780; Muslim, 1465. 

    The one to whom he did not give a portion of his time was 
    Sawdah bint Zam’ah, when she gave up her night to ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be 
    pleased with her). 

    Ibn al-Qayyim said: 

    There is no scholarly dispute concerning the fact that he 
    left nine behind when he died and that he used to give a portion of his time 
    to eight of them. Those nine were: ‘Aa’ishah, Hafsah, Zaynab bint Jahsh, Umm 
    Salamah, Safiyyah, Umm Habeebah, Maymoonah, Sawdah and Juwayriyyah. The 
    first of his wives to follow him after he died was Zaynab bint Jahsh in 20

General etiquette regarding food


How to praise Allah after eating","Praise be to Allah.Etiquette for eating in Islam
In Islam, there is an etiquette for eating, which is divided into categories:  
Etiquette before eating
·        Washing the hands before eating. The hands should be washed before eating, so that they may be clean when a person eats with them, and so that he will not be harmed by any dirt that may be on them. 
·        Part of the etiquette of eating is to ask about the food if you are a guest and you do not know what it is (i.e., what type of food it is), and you are not sure about what has been offered to you. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used not to eat food until he had been told about it or told what it was called, so that he would know what it was. Al-Bukhari narrated from Khalid ibn al-Walid that he and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered upon Maymunah, who was his [Khalid’s] maternal aunt and the maternal aunt of Ibn 'Abbas, and found that she had some roasted lizard that her sister Hafidah bint al-Harith had brought from Najd. She offered the lizard to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but he would rarely stretch forth his hand to food until he had been told what it was.  The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stretched forth his hand, then one of the women who were present said, “Tell the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that what has been offered to him is lizard.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) withdrew his hand from the lizard, and Khalid ibn al-Walid asked, “Is lizard haram, O Messenger of Allah?” He said, “No, but it is not found in the land of my people and I feel that I would have no liking for it. Khalid said, Then I chewed it and ate it, and the Messenger of Allah was looking at me. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5391; Muslim, 1946) 
Ibn al-Tin said: 
“He used to ask, because the Arabs would eat anything because food was hard to come by amongst them. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) may not have liked some things, so that was why he asked. It may be understood as meaning that he used to ask because some animals were forbidden in shari’ah and some were allowed, but they (the Arabs) did not regard anything as forbidden, and they may have brought him some grilled or cooked meat that could not have been distinguished from another type except by asking.” (Fath al-Bari, 9/534)
·        Hastening to eat when food is brought by the host. Part of honouring one's guest is to hasten to offer him something, and part of the guest’s honouring the host is to hasten to accept his food and eat from it. If the host sees the guest not eating, he may think badly of him. So the guest has to reassure his hosts by hastening to eat his food, because that will reassure him.
·        Mentioning the name of Allah before eating. It is obligatory to mention the name of Allah before eating. What is meant by that is saying “Bismillah (in the name of Allah)” when starting to eat. It was narrated from Umm Kalthum from ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you eats, let him mention the name of Allah. If he forgets to mention the name of Allah at the beginning, then let him say ‘Bismillahi awwalahu wa akhirahu (In the name of Allah at the beginning and at the end).’” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1858; Abu Dawud, 3767; Ibn Majah, 3264. Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Abi Dawud, 3202).
And ‘Umar ibn Abi Salamah said: I was a young boy in the care of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and my hand used to wander all over the platter (of food). The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to me, “O young boy, say Bismillah, eat with your right hand, and eat from what is directly in front of you.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5376; Muslim, 2022). 
Etiquette while eating
·        Eating with the right hand. It is obligatory for the Muslim to eat with his right hand; he should not eat with his left hand . It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one among you should eat with his left hand, or drink with it, for the Shaytan eats with his left hand and drinks with it.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2020) 
This applies so long as there is no excuse; if a person has an excuse for not eating and drinking with his right hand, such as sickness or injury etc., then there is nothing wrong with eating with his left hand. 
The hadith indicates that a person should avoid doing actions that resemble the actions of the Shaytan. 
·        Eating from what is directly in front of one. It is Sunnah for a person to eat from the food that is directly in front of him, and not reach out to take food that is directly in front of others, or from the middle of the platter, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to ‘Umar ibn Abi Salamah, “O young boy, say Bismillah, eat with your right hand, and eat from what is directly in front of you.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3576; Muslim, 2022)
For a person to eat from his companion’s place is bad manners and impolite. His companion may find this off-putting, especially if the food is soupy etc. That is because Ibn 'Abbas narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The blessing descends in the middle of the food, so eat from the edges and do not eat from the middle.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1805; Ibn Majah, 3277. Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 829) 
But if the food is dates or something of that type, (the scholars) narrated that it is permissible to eat from all parts of the plate. 
·        Washing the hands after eating. The Sunnah may be done by washing with water only. Ibn Raslan said: But it is better to wash the hands with potash or soap or something similar. (See Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi, 5/485)
So washing the hands is mustahabb both before and after eating, even if a person has wudu. 
·        Rinsing the mouth after eating. It is mustahabb to rinse the mouth after eating, because Bashir ibn Yasar narrated that Suwayd ibn al-Nu’man told him that they were with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in al-Sahba – which is some distance from Khaybar – and the time for prayer came. He called for food, but he did not find anything but some sawiq (barley mush). So he ate some and we all ate with him. Then he called for water and rinsed out his mouth, and then he prayed, and we prayed, and he did not do wudu. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5390)
·        Praying for one's host. Anas narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Sa’d ibn ‘Ubadah who brought him some bread and oil, and he ate. Then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “May fasting people break their fast with you, may the righteous eat your food, and may the angels send blessings upon you.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 3854; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Abi Dawud, 3263) 
·        Eating with three fingers. The Sunnah is to eat with three fingers; eating with more than three fingers is a sign of greed and is bad manners, because there is no need for more than three in order to gather up a morsel. If it is necessary to use more than three, because the food is light and cannot be gathered in three fingers, then he may use the fourth or fifth.  (See Fath al-Bari, 9/578)
This applies if a person is eating with his hand. But there is nothing wrong with using a spoon etc., as we shall see below. 
·        Eating a piece of food that falls on the floor. If a piece of food falls on the floor, then the person eating should remove any dirt that gets onto it and eat it; he should not leave it for the Shaytan, because he does not know where the blessing is in his food; it may be in the piece that fell, and leaving it makes a person miss out on the blessing of the food. Anas ibn Malik narrated that when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ate, he would lick his three fingers. Anas said: “And he said, ‘If any one of you drops a piece of food, let him remove any dirt from it and eat it, and not leave it for the Shaytan.’ And he commanded us to clean the plate, and said, ‘For you do not know where in your food the blessing is.’” (Narrated by Muslim, 2034). 
·        Not reclining whilst eating. That is because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I do not eat whilst I am reclining.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5399). The scholars differed as to what reclining meant. Ibn Hajar said: The scholars differed as to what reclining meant. It was said that it means being too comfortable in sitting to eat in whatever manner; or that it meant leaning on one side; or that it meant resting with one’s left arm on the ground… Ibn ‘Adiyy narrated with a da’if (weak) isnad that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) rebuked a man for resting on his left arm when eating. Malik said, this is a kind of reclining. I say, this indicates that Malik regarded as makruh everything that may be counted as reclining whilst eating, and he did not mention any one specific type thereof. (Fath al-Bari, 9/541)
·        Not spitting or blowing one's nose whilst eating, unless that is necessary. 
Other etiquette of eating
The etiquette of eating also includes: eating with a group; not speaking about haram things whilst eating ;
eating with one's wives and children; not keeping a particular food to oneself unless there is a reason for that,
such as it being for medicinal purposes – rather one should offer the best food to others first, such as pieces of
meat and soft or good bread. If the guest has had enough and stops eating, his host should say, “Eat!” and
repeat it, so long as he does not think that his guest has had enough, but he should not repeat it more than three
times.  He should clean between his teeth and not swallow any bits of food that come out from between his teeth. 
Etiquette after eating
It is Sunnah to say the words of praise to Allah and du’a after one has finished eating. When he had finished eating, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say, “Al-hamdu Lillahi hamdan kathiran tayyiban mubarakan fihi ghayra makfiyyin wa la muwadda’in wa la mustaghnan ‘anhu rabbana (Praise be to Allah, much good and blessed praise. O our Lord, You are not in need of anyone, and we cannot do without Your favour nor dispense with it).” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5458)
And whenever he ate food other than milk, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would say, “Allahumma barik lana fihi, wa at’imna khayran minhu (O Allah, bless it for us and feed us with better than it).” And when he drank milk he would say,  “Allahumma barik lana fihi wa zidna minhu (O Allah, bless it for us and give us more.).” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3377; classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 381). 
Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever is fed by Allah, let him say, ‘Allahumma barik lana fihi, wa at’imna khayran minhu (O Allah, bless it for us and feed us with better than it).’ And whoever is given milk to drink by Allah, let him say, ‘Allahumma barik lana fihi wa zidna minhu (O Allah, bless it for us and give us more)’.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3455; classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 2749). 
General etiquette regarding food
·        Not criticizing the food. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) never criticized any food. If he liked it he would eat it and if he did not like it he would leave it. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3370; Muslim, 2046) 
What is referred to here is permissible food; as for haram food he would criticize it and forbid it. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
“Part of the confirmed etiquette of food is not to criticize it such as saying it is too salty, or too sour, or not salty enough, or thick, or thin, or not well-cooked, etc. Ibn Battal said: This is part of good manners, because a person may not like food that others like, but there is nothing wrong with eating anything that is permitted in the Shari’ah.” (Sharh Muslim, 14/26)
·        Part of the etiquette of eating is moderation in eating and not filling the stomach . The most that a Muslim is permitted to do in this regard is to divide his stomach into three thirds: one-third for food, one-third for drink and one-third for air. “A man does not fill any vessel worse than his stomach. It is sufficient for the son of Adam to eat enough to keep him alive. But if he must do that, then one-third for his food, one-third for his drink and one-third for his air.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2380; Ibn Majah, 3349; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 1939) 
This keeps the body healthy and light, because eating one’s fill makes the body heavy, which leads to laziness in worship and work. One-third is defined as being one-third of that which would make you feel full. (Al-Mawsu’ah, 25/332)
·        Avoiding eating and drinking from vessels of gold and silver, because that is haram. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not wear silk or brocade, and do not drink from vessels of gold and silver, or eat from plates thereof. They are for them in this world and for us in the Hereafter.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5426; Muslim, 2067) 
·        Praising Allah after finishing eating. There is a great deal of virtue in this. It was narrated from Anas ibn Malik that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah is pleased with His slave when he eats something and praises Him for it, or drinks something and praises Him for it.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2734) 
How to praise Allah after eating
Several ways of praising Allah have been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): 
·        Al-Bukhari narrated that Abu Umamah said: When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) finished eating, he would say, “Al-hamdu Lillah hamdan kathiran mubarakan fihi ghayra makfiyyin wa la muwadda’in wa la mustaghnan ‘anhu rabbana (Praise be to Allah, much good and blessed praise. O our Lord, You are not in need of anyone, and we cannot do without Your favour nor dispense with it).” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5458). 
Ibn Hajar said: “ ‘ghayra makfiyyin (You are not in need of anyone)’ means that He has no need of any of His slaves but He is the One Who feeds His slaves and suffices them.” 
·        Mu’adh ibn Anas narrated that his father said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever eats some food then says, ‘Al-hamdu Lillahi alladhi at’amani hadha wa razaqnihi min ghayri hawlin minni wa la quwwah (Praise be to Allah Who has fed me this and provided me with it with no power or strength on my part),’ his previous sins will be forgiven.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3458; Ibn Majah, 3285; classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 3348). 
·        Abu Ayyub al-Ansari (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ate or drank anything, he would say, ‘Al-hamdu Lillah alladhi at’ama wa saqa wa sawwaghahu wa ja’ala lahu makhrajan (Praise be to Allah Who has given food and drink,made it easy to swallow and provided an exit for it).’” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 3851 and classed as sahih by al-Albani). 
·        ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Jubayr narrated that a man who served the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for eight years told him that he used to hear the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saying, when food was brought near him, “Bismillah .” And when he had finished eating he would say, “Allahumma at’amta wa asqayta wa hadayta wa ahyayta, fa laka’l-hamd ‘ala ma a’tayta (O Allah, You have fed, given to drink, guided and brought to life, so praise be to You for what You have given).” (Narrated by Ahmad, 16159; classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Sahihah, 1/111) 
Note: it is mustahabb to use all the words of praise that have been narrated to be said after finishing eating. So you can say one du’aa’ on one occasion, another du’a on another occasion, and so on, so that you will have followed the Sunnah in all ways and attain the blessing of these du’as, as well as feeling the meanings of these words in your heart when you say them on various occasions, because if you get used to saying a particular du’aa’ all the time, you think less about its meaning, because you have said it so often.

13350,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13350,"If kaafirs have good morals, will they enter Paradise? Will the children of the kuffaar enter Paradise?","Is it true that all the kuffaar, even if their morals are good and they do not harm anyone, will enter Hell? If the answer is yes, then what about non-Muslim children and those who had no choice but to be born kaafirs?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.You should note that all the kaafirs who hear the message of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and do not enter Islam will go to Hell. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, those who disbelieve (in the religion of Islam, the Quran and Prophet Muhammad) from among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and Al-Mushrikoon will abide in the fire of Hell. They are the worst of creatures”
[al-Bayyinah 98:6]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, no one of this nation, Jew or Christian, hears of me then dies without having believed in that with which I was sent, but he will be one of the people of the Fire.” Narrated by Muslim, 153. 
The point is not whether their morals are good, rather the point is whether they submit to Allah and obey his commands. Do you not see the Magians [Zoroastrians] or the Buddhists, for example, who worship fire or idols instead of Allah, and they do not worship Allah or submit to Him alone, and the Christians who say that God has a son, and other mushriks (those who associate others with Allah). They are being ill-mannered towards Allah, and insulting and reviling Him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah says, ‘The son of Adam denied Me and he had no right to do so. And he reviled Me and he had no right to do so. As for his denying Me, it is his saying: He will not remake me as He made me at first - and the initial creation [of him] is no easier for Me than remaking him. As for his reviling Me, it is his saying: Allah has taken to Himself a son, while I am the One, the Everlasting Refuge. I begot not nor was I begotten, and there is none comparable to Me.’” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4974. 
So how can their morals be good when they are so ill-mannered towards Allah, even though Allah has given them hearing and sight, and has made everything easy for them, and has sent His Messengers to them and revealed His Books to them, and bestowed His blessings upon them, so it is His right that they should thank Him and not be ungrateful to Him or disbelieve in Him. If they do not do that then they deserve His punishment and wrath. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and your Lord treats no one with injustice”
[al-Kahf 18:49]
With regard to the situation of their children who die when still young, Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz was asked about that and he said: 
If one who is not yet accountable dies among kaafir parents, then he comes under the same rulings as them in this world, so he should not be washed and the funeral prayer should not be offered for him, and he should not be buried in the Muslim graveyard. 
But in the Hereafter his case is referred to Allah. It was narrated in a saheeh report that when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about the children of the mushrikeen he said: “Allah knows best what they would have done.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1384.  
Some of the scholars were of the view that Allah’s knowledge about them will be made manifest on the Day of Resurrection, and that they will be tested, as will the people who lived during the fatrah (interval between two Prophets) and others. If they do what they are told to do then they will enter Paradise, and if they disobey then they will enter Hell. There are saheeh ahaadeeth from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which say that the people who lived during the fatrah (interval between two Prophets) will be tested on the Day of Resurrection. These are the people whom the call of the Messengers did not reach and those who come under a similar ruling, such as the children of the mushrikeen, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning)”
[al-Isra’ 17:15]
This is the most correct view among the various opinions concerning the people who lived during the fatrah (interval between two Prophets) and others whom the call did not reach, and it is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and his student Ibn al-Qayyim, and a number of the earlier and later generations.

13356,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13356,Is Touching a Dog Haram?,"Is it haram or even undesirable for us to touch dogs? I have heard many Muslims say that dogs are dirty and Satan has spit on them. Also, if we touch a dog, we have to wash our hands several times. I haven't been able to find anything concerning this in the Quran, Hadith, or Islamic books. Please help.","If you touch a dog when it is not wet, then your hand does not become impure. If you touch a dog when it is wet, this means that the hand becomes impure and must be washed seven times, one of which should be with earth.","Is it haram to keep a dog?


What to do after touching a dog","Praise be to Allah.Is it haram to keep a dog?
It is haram to keep a dog unless it is for the purposes for which Islam permits keeping dogs. Whoever keeps a dog – except a dog for hunting or farming – his reward will decrease each day by one or two qirats. 
Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: ‘Whoever keeps a dog, except a dog that is trained for hunting or a dog for herding livestock, his reward will decrease each day by two qirats.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5059; Muslim, 2941; according to another version narrated by them both, “one qeirat”). 
The word qirat refers to a large amount of reward; if a person’s reward decreases by one qirat, that means that he is sinning, for losing reward is like earning sin, both indicate that something is haram because of the consequences it leads to. 
The impurity of dogs is the greatest of animal impurities. The impurity of a dog can only be removed by washing seven times, one of which should be with earth. Even pigs, which the Quran states are haram and describes as an abomination (rijs) are not najis (impure) to such an extent. 
Dogs are impure and filthy, but unfortunately we find that some people are attracted to the ways of the disbelievers and their filthy habits, so they have started to keep dogs unnecessarily for no reason, keeping them, training them and cleaning them even though they can never be clean, even if they were washed with the waters of the ocean, because they are essentially impure. 
Our advice to them is to repent to Allah and to get the dogs out of their homes. 
But in the case of dogs which are needed for hunting, farming and herding livestock, there is nothing wrong with that because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave permission for that. 
What to do after touching a dog 
If you touch a dog when it is not wet, then your hand does not become impure, but if you touch it when it is wet, this means that the hand becomes impure, according to the opinion of many scholars, and the hand must be washed seven times, one of which should be with earth. 
With regard to vessels, if a dog has licked a vessel (i.e., drunk from it), then the vessel must be washed seven times, one of which should be with earth, as was proven in al-Sahihayn and elsewhere, in the hadith narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If a dog licks the vessel of any one of you, let him wash it seven times, one of which should be with earth.” It is better if the washing with earth be the first washing.

13357,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13357,He is married to his maternal aunt through breastfeeding,"Until recently there were concubines in our country, and this issue has come up; I would like to know the shar’i ruling on it. 

A man had a wife whose name was Aaminah, and he had a concubine whose name was Sa’diyyah. 

Aaminah (his wife) breastfed a girl called Zaynab, and the slave woman Sa’diyyah had a daughter whose name was Haleemah. 

The daughter, Haleemah, got married and had a son called ‘Ali, who grew up and married Zaynab, who had been breastfed by Aaminah. 

They have been married for many years, and have several sons and daughters. 
My question is, what is the ruling on this marriage? 

Is it permissible for me not to tell them, if this marriage is not legitimate?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.One of the rulings on radaa’ah 
    (breastfeeding) is that the milk of the wet nurse has an effect on the child she breastfeeds and on his or her children. If Zayd was breastfed by 
    Faatimah, then Zayd and his children are regarded as children of the wet nurse (Faatimah), but his brothers are not connected to them through 
    breastfeeding. 
But for the wet nurse, the bond established 
    by breastfeeding includes all her relatives, so whoever is related to the wet nurse is also related to the child whom she breastfed. So the 
    husband of the wet nurse is regarded as a father of the child through breastfeeding; her brothers are regarded as maternal uncles through 
    breastfeeding, and her father and grandfathers are regarded as grandfathers of the child through breastfeeding. If her husband has another wife, 
    then this woman is regarded as the wife of the child’s father through breastfeeding, and her children are regarded as his brothers on the father’s 
    side through breastfeeding… and so on. ‘Urwah ibn al-Zubayr narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: Aflah the brother of Abu’l-Qu’ays asked permission to 
    enter upon me after the ruling on hijab had been revealed, and I said, “I will not let you in until I ask the permission of the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), for it was not the brother of Abu’l-Qu’ays who nursed me but the wife of Abu’l-Qu’ays.” The Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) entered upon me and I said to him, “O Messenger of Allaah, Aflah the brother of Abu’l-Qu’ays 
    asked permission to enter upon me, but I refused to let him in until I asked your permission.” 
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “What stopped you from letting him in? He is your (paternal) uncle.” 
I said, “O Messenger of Allaah, the man is 
    not the one who nursed me, rather it was the wife of Abu’l-Qu’ays who nursed me.” 
He said, “Let him in, for he is your uncle, 
    may your right hand be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper)!” 
‘Urwah said: For that reason  ‘Aa’ishah used 
    to say, “Consider those things which are illegal (for marriage) because of blood relations as illegal because of the corresponding relations 
    through breastfeeding.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4796; Muslim 1445. 
This hadeeth confirms that there are parents 
    through breastfeeding, and that the husband of the wet nurse is regarded as a father of the child through breastfeeding. The wife of Abu’l-Qu’ays 
    breastfed ‘Aa’ishah, so she became a mother to her, and her husband became a father to her through breastfeeding, and his brothers became paternal 
    uncles to ‘Aa’ishah through breastfeeding. Hence the brother of Abu’l-Qu’ays said to ‘Aa’ishah, “Do you observe hijab before me when I am your 
    paternal uncle?” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3644. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) confirmed that he was a paternal 
    uncle to ‘Aa’ishah when he said, “Let him in, for he is your uncle, may your right hand be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper)!” 
See al-Mughni ma’a al-Sharh al-Kabeer, 
    9/199; al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 22/248. 
With regard to the matter mentioned in the question, the answer is as follows: 
The daughter, Zaynab, who was nursed by the 
    wife, Aaminah, is regarded as a daughter of Aaminah because of this breastfeeding. She is also a daughter to Aaminah’s husband through 
    breastfeeding. So the husband is her father through breastfeeding, if the child was nursed five times or more when the infant was under the age of 
    two years. Based on that, the husband’s daughter Haleemah from his concubine Sa’diyyah is the sister of Zaynab through her father through 
    breastfeeding, and Haleemah’s children – including ‘Ali – are mahrams to Zaynab because she is their maternal aunt through breastfeeding. So it is 
    not permissible for any of them to marry her. 
You mention in your question that ‘Ali married Zaynab. This marriage is invalid and he must 
    leave her at once, because he is regarded as having married his maternal aunt through breastfeeding. 
With regard to the children who were born as 
    a result of this marriage, they are legitimate children who should be named after their father ‘Ali, because this is regarded as an ambiguous 
    marriage and children born as a result of that are to be named after the father, as the scholars said. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz was asked: I was breastfed by a woman whose husband took a 
    second wife and had children from her. Are they my brothers? 
He replied: If you were breastfed five times 
    or more, and the milk belonged to the husband because it was produced as the result of a baby being born to him, then they are your brothers 
    through your father through breastfeeding.” Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/323. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) was asked a similar question: 
After I had consummated the marriage with my 
    wife, I found out that she is my sister through breastfeeding, because I was breastfed along with her sister. Is she my mahram in this case? 
He replied: Yes, if the matter is as you say, 
    and you were breastfed along with the wife’s sister from her mother, in the sense that you were breastfed by the wife’s mother or her father’s 
    wife, then you are her brother and the marriage is invalid. But you should realize that breastfeeding does not count unless the child is breastfed 
    five or more times in the two years before weaning. If it was less than that, then it has no effect and it does not establish the relationship of 
    mahram. 
If you are certain that you were breastfed 
    five times or more by the mother of the woman whom you have married in the first two years of life, then you must leave her because this marriage 
    is not valid. Any children who were born before you found out are to be named after you according to sharee’ah, because these children were 
    born as the result of an ambiguous marriage and children born as a result of that are to be named after the father, as the scholars said. 
Fataawa Islamiyyah, 
    3/329. 
You have to tell them about that, because 
    they have the right to receive sincere advice from you and so as to denounce an evil action, because their staying in this invalid marriage is an 
    evil action. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his 
    hand (by taking action), and if he cannot then with his tongue (by speaking out) …” Narrated by Muslim.

But if there is no harm in eating them together, then you may do so if you wish.

    anything left of the rent, so no zakaah was due on it, because no full year passed with the money in his possession. In order for zakaah to be 
    obligatory, a full year should pass with it in the person’s possession.","Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 18/208"
13363,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13363,Can Muslims settle in kaafir countries for the sake of a better life?,"I live in a western country, and I can practice my religion without much difficulty, praise be to Allaah. I have seen on your site some ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) which forbid Muslims to settle in kaafir lands or to live among the kuffaar. I am now confused about whether to go back to my country or to stay in this country, knowing that if I go back to my country, I will encounter hardship and persecution because of my adherence to the laws of Allaah, and I will not be able to find freedom of worship such as I enjoy in the country where I live now.
I hope that you can answer my question and explain the ruling on my staying in this country, especially since the Muslim countries are no longer very different from others with regard to adherence to the laws of Islam.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
The basic principle is that it is not permissible for the Muslim to settle among the mushrikeen if he is unable to practice his religion openly while being able to emigrate to a Muslim country. This is indicated by evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnah.
In the Qur’aan, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, as for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (as they stayed among the disbelievers even though emigration was obligatory for them), they (angels) say (to them): “In what (condition) were you?” They reply: “We were weak and oppressed on the earth.” They (angels) say: “Was not the earth of Allaah spacious enough for you to emigrate therein?” Such men will find their abode in Hell — what an evil destination!”
[al-Nisa’ 4:97]
In the Sunnah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I disown every Muslim who settles among the mushrikeen.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2645; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
With regard to common sense, the Muslim who settles among the mushrikeen cannot carry out many of the rituals and visible acts of worship of Islam, in addition to the fact that he is exposing himself to temptation because of the permissiveness in those countries that is protected by their laws. The Muslim should not expose himself to temptations and trials. 
This is if we look at the evidence of the Qur’aan and Sunnah without paying attention to what is really happening in Muslim countries and kaafir countries. But if we look at what is really happening in Muslim countries, we cannot agree with the questioner when he says, “Especially since the Muslim countries are no longer very different from others with regard to adherence to the laws of Islam.” But this generalization is not correct. The Muslim countries are not all the same with regard to how closely or otherwise they adhere to the laws of Islam. Rather they vary in that, and even within one country, regions and cities may vary in that regard. 
Similarly the kaafir countries are not all the same with regard to their permissiveness and moral laxity; they also vary in that regard. 
So given that the Muslim countries vary, as do the kaafir countries, and given that the Muslim cannot go to a Muslim state and settle there because of visa and strict settlement laws etc, and that a Muslim may not be able to practice his religion in some Muslim countries, when he may be able to do so in whole or at least in part in some kaafir countries – for all these reasons it is impossible to issue a general ruling that will cover all countries and all individuals. Rather we should say that each Muslim has his own unique set of circumstances and his own ruling that applies to him, and each person is accountable for himself. If he is able to practise his religion in the Muslim country in which he lives more than he can in a kaafir country, then it is not permissible for him to settle in a kaafir country. But if it is the other way round, then it is permissible for him to settle in a kaafir country, subject to the condition that he is confident that he can resist the desires and temptations to be found there by taking the precautionary measures prescribed in sharee’ah. 
There follow some comments of the scholars which support what we have said above: 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about this matter and he said: This is one of the most difficult issues nowadays because countries vary, as stated above, and because for some Muslims, if they go back to their homelands they will be persecuted for their religion whereas they are safe from that in the kaafir countries. But if we say that it is haraam for them to settle among the kuffaar, then where is the Islamic state that will accept them and allow them to settle there?! This is the meaning of what he said, may Allaah have mercy on him. 
Zakariya al-Ansaari al-Shaafa’i said in his book Asna al-Mataalib (4/207): 
It is obligatory to migrate from the kaafir lands to the Muslim lands for those who are able to do that, if they are unable to practise their religion openly. 
Ibn al-‘Arabi al-Maaliki said: Hijrah (migration) means leaving dar al-harb [non-Muslim lands] and going to dar al-islam [Muslim lands]. This was obligatory at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and remains so after his time for those who fear for their lives. From Nayl al-Awtaar, 8/33, by al-Shawkaani. 
Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said concerning the hadeeth, “I disown every Muslim who settles among the mushrikeen”: 
This is to be understood as referring to those who are not safe to practise their religion there. Fath al-Baari, commentary on hadeeth no. 2825 
In al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (20/206) it says: 
Dar al-harb refers to every place in which the rule of kufr prevails. One of the rulings that have to do with dar al-harb is hijrah (migration). With regard to migration from dar al-harb, the fuqaha’ divided people into three categories: 
(a) Those who are obliged to migrate: they are those who are able to migrate and who cannot practise their religion openly in dar al-harb. It is obligatory upon a female even if she does not have a mahram, if she thinks she will be safe when travelling, or if the risk of travelling is less than the risk of staying in dar al-harb…
(b) Those who are not obliged to migrate: they are those who are unable to do so, either because of sickness or because they are forced to stay in the kaafir land, or those who are weak, such as woman and children, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Except the weak ones among men, women and children who cannot devise a plan, nor are they able to direct their way”
[al-Nisa’ 4:98]
(c)Those for whom migration is mustahabb but not obligatory: they include those who are able to migrate but are also able to practise their religion openly in dar al-harb. It is mustahabb for such a person to migrate so that he can participate in jihad and increase the numbers of the Muslims.
In a fatwa issued by the Standing Committee (12/50): One may also migrate from a mushrik land to another mushrik land that is less evil and where there is less danger to the Muslim, as some of the Muslims migrated from Makkah at the Prophet’s command to Abyssinia.

          He created them from fire before He created Adam, as Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning):  
“And indeed, We created man from 
          dried (sounding) clay of altered mud. 
And the jinn, We created aforetime from the smokeless 
          flame of fire” 
[al-Hijr 15:26-27] 
 Just as Adam had descendents, so Iblees 
          had descendents too, as Allaah says of Iblees (interpretation of the 
          meaning):  
“Will you then take him (Iblees) 
          and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me while they 
          are enemies to you? What an evil is the exchange for the Zaalimoon (polytheists, 
          and wrongdoers, etc)” 
[al-Kahf 18:50]  
Allaah created the jinn and mankind to worship 
          Him. Whoever obeys Him will enter Paradise and whoever disobeys Him 
          will enter Hell:  
“And I (Allaah) created not the 
          jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone). 
I seek not any provision from them (i.e. provision 
          for themselves or for My creatures) nor do I ask that they should feed 
          Me (i.e. feed themselves or My creatures). 
Verily, Allaah is the All Provider, Owner of Power, 
          the Most Strong” 
[al-Dhaariyaat 51:56 – interpretation]  
          
All of the jinn, like mankind, are accountable. 
          Among them there are believers and kaafirs, those who obey Allaah and 
          those who disobey Him, as Allaah tells us that they said: 
 “‘There are among us some that are 
          righteous, and some the contrary; we are groups having different ways 
          (religious sects)’” 
[al-Jinn 72:11 – interpretation of the meaning]  
          
The jinn will be rewarded or punished in the 
          Hereafter just like mankind. Allaah tells us that they said: 
 “‘And of us some are Muslims (who 
          have submitted to Allaah, after listening to this Qur’aan), and of us 
          some are Al-Qaasitoon (disbelievers   those who have deviated 
          from the Right Path)’. And whosoever has embraced Islam (i.e. has become 
          a Muslim by submitting to Allaah), then such have sought the Right Path.’ 
          
And as for the Qaasitoon (disbelievers who deviated 
          from the Right Path), they shall be firewood for Hell” 
[al-Jinn 72:14-15 – interpretation of the meaning] 
          
 The jinn and mankind will all be brought 
          to account on the Day of Resurrection before the Lord of the Worlds. 
          None of them will be able to postpone that or flee from it. 
 “O assembly of jinn and men! If you 
          have power to pass beyond the zones of the heavens and the earth, then 
          pass beyond (them)! But you will never be able to pass them, except 
          with authority (from Allaah)!” 
[al-Rahmaan 55:33 – interpretation of the meaning] 
          
 Whoever among the jinn 
          or mankind tries to flee from the Reckoning will never be able to do 
          so, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
 “There will be sent against you both, 
          smokeless flames of fire and (molten) brass, and you will not be able 
          to defend yourselves 
[al-Rahmaan 55:35] 
 When the Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was in Makkah, a group of 
          the jinn came to him; they heard the Qur’aan and were moved by it: 
 “And (remember) when We sent towards 
          you (Muhammad) a group (three to ten persons) of the jinn, (quietly) 
          listening to the Qur’aan. When they stood in the presence thereof, they 
          said: “Listen in silence!” And when it was finished, they returned to 
          their people, as warners” 
[al-Ahqaaf 46:29 – interpretation of the meaning]  
          
Some of the jinn believed when they heard 
          the Qur’aan, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 “Say (O Muhammad): ‘It has been revealed 
          to me that a group (from three to ten in number) of jinn listened (to 
          this Qur’aan). They said: “Verily, we have heard a wonderful Recitation 
          (this Qur’aan)! 
It guides to the Right Path, and we have believed 
          therein, and we shall never join (in worship) anything with our Lord 
          (Allaah)”’” 
[al-Jinn 72:1-2] 
 Both Adam and Iblees fell into sin, 
          but Adam regretted it and repented, and Allaah accepted his repentance: 
          
 “Then Adam received from his Lord 
          Words. And his Lord pardoned him (accepted his repentance). Verily, 
          He is the One Who forgives (accepts repentance), the Most Merciful” 
          
[al-Baqarah 2:37 – interpretation of the meaning]  
          
But Iblees refused and was arrogant, so he 
          was one of the disbelievers:  
“And (remember) when We said to 
          the angels: ‘Prostrate yourselves before Adam.’ And they prostrated 
          except Iblees (Satan), he refused and was proud and was one of the disbelievers 
          (disobedient to Allaah)” 
[al-Baqarah 2:34 – interpretation of the meaning]  
          
Whoever disobeys Allaah out of pride and arrogance, 
          among the jinn and mankind, is following the Shaytaan and will be gathered 
          with him in the Fire of Hell if he does not repent, as Allaah said to 
          Iblees:  
“(Allaah) said: ‘The truth is — 
          and the truth I say   
That I will fill Hell with you [Iblees (Satan)] and 
          those of them (mankind) that follow you, together’” 
[Saad 38:84-85 – interpretation of the meaning]  
          
The friends of the Most Merciful (Allaah), 
          among the jinn and mankind, co-operate in righteousness and piety, and 
          the friends of the Shaytaan, among the jinn and mankind, co-operate 
          in sin and transgression. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
          
“And so We have appointed for every 
          Prophet enemies — Shayaateen (devils) among mankind and jinn, inspiring 
          one another with adorned speech as a delusion (or by way of deception). 
          If your Lord had so willed, they would not have done it; so leave them 
          alone with their fabrications” 
[al-An’aam 6:112]  
The jinn used to have places near the 
          heavens where they would sit to eavesdrop (on the inhabitants of the 
          heavens), but when Allaah sent His Messenger Muhammad 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) they were no longer allowed 
          to do that. Whoever among them tries to listen is burned with a flaming 
          fire, as Allaah tells us that the jinn said:  
“ ‘And we have sought to reach the 
          heaven; but found it filled with stern guards and flaming fires. 
And verily, we used to sit there in stations, to (steal) 
          a hearing, but any who listens now will find a flaming fire watching 
          him in ambush’” 
[al-Jinn 72:8-9 – interpretation of the meaning]   
          
The jinn are with us on this earth, but 
          by the mercy of Allaah they see us and we do not see them, as Allaah 
          says of Iblees and his tribe (interpretation of the meaning):  
          
“Verily, he and Qabeeluhu (his soldiers 
          from the jinn or his tribe) see you from where you cannot see them” 
          
[al-A’raaf 7:27]  
Whoever can see you when you cannot see him, and 
          he is your enemy, is more dangerous. So you must always beware of him 
          and protect yourself from the devils among the jinn and mankind.","From Usool al-Deen al-Islami, by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem al-Tuwayjri"

Nay, but We have brought them the truth (Islamic Monotheism), and verily, they (disbelievers) are liars”
[al-Mu’minoon 23:84-90 – interpretation of the meaning] 
O mankind, will you not respond? 
“Say (to the disbelievers): “Tell me, if Allaah took away your hearing and your sight, and sealed up your hearts, who is there — an ilaah (a god) other than Allaah who could restore them to you?”
[al-An’aam 6:46 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Will you not understand?

Say (O Muhammad): ‘Tell me! If Allaah made the day continuous for you till the Day of Resurrection, which ilaah (a god) besides Allaah could bring you night wherein you rest? Will you not then see?’”
[al-Qasas 28:71-72 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Will you not think? 
“Then tell Me (about) the (human) semen that you emit.
Is it you who create it (i.e. make this semen into a perfect human being), or are We the Creator?”
[al-Waaqi’ah 56:58-59 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Will you not see? 
“Then tell Me about the seed that you sow in the ground.
Is it you that make it grow, or are We the Grower?”
[al-Waaq’iah 56:63-64 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Will you not understand?  
“Then tell Me about the water that you drink.
Is it you who cause it from the rain clouds to come down, or are We the Causer of it to come down?
If We willed, We verily, could make it salt (and undrinkable); why then do you not give thanks (to Allaah)?
Then tell Me about the fire which you kindle.
Is it you who made the tree thereof to grow, or are We the Grower?
We have made it a Reminder (of the Hell fire in the Hereafter), and an article of use for the travellers (and all the others, in this world).
Then glorify with praises the Name of your Lord, the Most Great”
[al-Waaqi’ah 56:68-74 interpretation of the meaning] 
Will you not realize? Who has subjugated the night and the day, the sun, moon, planets and stars? It is Allaah alone, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And He has subjected to you the night and the day, and the sun and the moon; and the stars are subjected by His Command. Surely, in this are proofs for people who understand
[al-Nahl 16:12] 
Since Allaah is the One Who creates, and He is the One Who provides, and He is the One Who controls all things, and He is the One Who knows all things, then He is the only One Who deserves to be worshipped, because He is Ever-Living, Self-Sustaining, the Creator, Provider, All-Knowing, All-Powerful, and anyone besides Him is incapable and weak, unable to create or provide, with no power of bringing benefit or causing harm: 
“And Allaah knows what you conceal and what you reveal.
Those whom they (Al Mushrikoon) invoke besides Allaah have not created anything, but are themselves created.
(They are) dead, not alive; and they know not when they will be raised up.
Your Ilaah (God) is One Ilaah (God Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped but He). But for those who believe not in the Hereafter, their hearts deny (the faith in the Oneness of Allaah), and they are proud”
[al-Nahl 16:19-22 – interpretation of the meaning]","From Usool al-Deen al-Islami, by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem al-Tuwayjri"
