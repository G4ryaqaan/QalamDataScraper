Side effects of fake eyelashes","Praise be to Allah.Wearing fake eyelashes in Islam
It is haram for a woman to wear false eyelashes because they come under the heading of hair extensions, for which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed those who do that. 
Al-Bukhari and Muslim (2122) narrated that Asma bint Abi Bakr said: A woman came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, I have a daughter who is newly married, and she had the measles and her hair fell out. Can I give her hair extensions?” He said: “Allah has cursed the one who fixes hair extensions and the one who has that done.” 
Al-Bukhari (5205) and Muslim (2123) narrated from ‘Aishah that a girl from among the Ansar got married and she became sick and her hair fell out. They wanted to give her hair extensions, so they asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about that, and he cursed the one who fixes hair extensions and the one who has that done. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
“The one who fixes hair extensions is the one who joins the other hair to the woman’s hair. The one who has that done is the woman who asks someone else to do that for her. These ahadith clearly state that it is haram to fix hair extensions, and the one who fixes hair extensions and the one who has that done are both cursed in general terms. This is the more correct meaning.” 
False eyelashes come under the same heading, because the real eyelashes are extended with the false ones. 
Side effects of fake eyelashes
Moreover some doctors have mentioned that false eyelashes lead to chronic allergies in the skin and eyes, and to infection in the eyelids, and may cause the eyelashes to fall out. So using them is harmful, and the Lawgiver forbids that as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm.” (Zinat al-Marah bayna al-Tibb wa’l-Shar’, p. 33) 
The Muslim woman should note that paying too much attention to such matters may be a kind of over-indulgence in leisure and luxury, and a waste of time and money which she could have used for something more beneficial to the Muslims, especially nowadays when people have no drive to do good and women have been distracted from their basic role which is to raise the next generation, and instead they are paying too much attention to these matters.

39318,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39318,She left her husband’s house and refuses to go back,"I hope you can advise me and tell me what I should do according to sharee’ah and in a manner that will be pleasing to Allaah. I am a young doctor, and got married three years ago. My fiancée (now my wife) was a very good person, and she was easy going. But after marriage all that changed. I had debts, and she knew all about my income, but she still used to ask me for money of her own. When I tried to convince her to be patient and wait until I had paid off my debts, and that she should help me with that, she went crazy and told my mother in law, who kept insisting that I do as her daughter wanted, but I refused.  Then she asked me to let her go to work, although we had agreed that she should not work unless I was unable to work. My mother in law kept bothering me a lot, until I agreed. After that there arose a lot of problems. She used to – and still does – treat my father and mother in an inappropriate manner; it has got to the point where she humiliates them. After we got married, Allaah blessed us with a little girl who is the envy of others. The point is that she went out of the house without my permission more than once, and she was not deterred by my speaking to her or forsaking her in bed or hitting her. She embarrassed me in front of the people who live in the same building as us, because she was talking about our problems to the other residents, our neighbours and her friends and relatives. All attempts to deal with her have failed; even the shaykh at the mosque spoke to her, but it did no good. The result of all this is that I no longer have any feelings for her; we have had a lot of arguments and I have divorced her (talaaq) twice, then we got back together for the sake of our young daughter whom Allaah gave to us. Recently my in-laws came back from a trip and she went to them on the basis that she would stay for a few days, then the time was extended to thirty days because her father is sick and her mother is old. When I asked her and my daughter to come back to my house, she refused, and when I spoke to her father he refused to send her back to her marital home. I threatened to take the matter to court but they did not care. I discovered that my wife and daughter’s personal papers, passports and gold are missing (she took them before she went to her family’s house). Please advise me, may Allaah reward you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If the matter is as you describe, then your wife has made a number of mistakes, by 
    going out without your permission, staying in her family’s house, and refusing to come back to you with no apparent excuse; before all that comes 
    her insistence on going out to work, contrary to what you had both agreed, and her inappropriate treatment of your parents, and her broadcasting 
    the secrets of what goes on in her home. 
What we advise you to do is to follow the guidance given by the Lord of the Worlds 
    when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“If you fear a breach between them twain (the man and his wife), appoint (two) arbitrators, one 
    from his family and the other from hers; if they both wish for peace, Allaah will cause their reconciliation. Indeed Allaah is Ever All-Knower, 
    Well-Acquainted with all things”
[al-Nisa’ 4:35]
So choose one of the righteous men from your family to discuss the matter with one 
    of the righteous men from her family, then whatever they decide, adhere to it, for that is good. If they decide that you should divorce her, then 
    do not be upset, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But if they separate (by divorce), Allaah will provide abundance for everyone 
    of them from His Bounty. And Allaah is Ever All-Sufficient for His creatures’ needs, All-Wise”
[al-Nisa’ 4:130]
If appointing arbitrators does not do any good, then you can refer the matter to court, so 
    that the court can either force her to come home or separate you, as they see fit. 
During this period, try to control what you do and what you say, for the Shaytaan 
    is keen to separate husbands and wives, and a word may have a great impact when there is already dispute and division. Ask Allaah to guide you and 
    to help you to do that which is best for you and your daughter. Do not do anything until you have prayed istikhaarah, and beware of being hasty, 
    for it does not lead to good. You have to be gentle, forbearing and cautious, for how many families have been about to collapse, then they have 
    reconciled and happiness and love returned to them. 
Examine yourself and see if there are any mistakes on your part, and set things 
    straight between you and your Lord, so that He might set things straight between you and His creation, for obedience and disobedience have an 
    effect on whether families are happy or not.  
We ask Allaah to set things straight between you and to help you to obey and 
    please Him.

39328,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39328,It is not valid to combine making up missed Ramadan fasts with fasting six days of Shawwal with one intention,Is it permissible for me to fast the six days of Shawwal with the same intention as making up the days I did not fast in Ramadan because of menstruation?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.That is not valid, because fasting the six days of Shawwal can only be done after fasting Ramadan in full. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in Fatawa al-Siyaam (438): 
Whoever fasts the day of ‘Arafah, or the day of 'Ashura, but still owes days from Ramadan, his fast is valid, but if he intends to fast this day to make up for a missed Ramadan fast, he will have two rewards: the reward for the day of ‘Arafah or'Ashura along with the reward for making up the missed fast. This has to do with voluntary fasts in general that are not connected to Ramadan. With regard to fasting the six days of Shawwal, they are connected to Ramadan and can only done after making up missed Ramadan fasts. If he fasts them before making up missed Ramadan fasts he will not attain that reward, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever fasts Ramadan then follows it with six days of Shawwal, it will be as if he fasted for a lifetime.” It is well known that whoever still owes days from Ramadan is not regarded as having fasted Ramadan until he makes up the days he missed.",Islam Q&A
39344,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39344,Ruling on a non-Muslim who dies defending his homeland,"If a Christian is killed in battle defending his homeland, is he regarded as a martyr (shaheed)? What is the ruling in this case?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Whoever is killed for the sake of Allah is a martyr. What is meant by “for the sake of Allah” is that he is fighting so that the word of Allah will be uppermost. This is the definition of the martyr killed in battle, as stated by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Al-Bukhari (3126) and Muslim (1904) narrated that Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A Bedouin said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “A man fights for the sake of booty, and a man fights so that he will become famous, and a man fights to show off – who is fighting for the sake of Allah?” He said, “The one who fights so that the word of Allah will be uppermost is the one who is fighting for the sake of Allah.” 
Muslim (1915) narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Who do you think is a martyr among you?” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, the one who is killed for the sake of Allah is a martyr,” He said, “The martyrs of my ummah would be few in that case.” They said, “Then who are they, O Messenger of Allah?” He said: “The one who is killed for the sake of Allah is a martyr; the one who dies for the sake of Allah is a martyr; the one who dies of the plague is a martyr; the one who dies of a stomach disease is a martyr; and the one who drowns is a martyr.” 
So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) mentioned both the martyrs who die in battle and those who also share the virtue of martyrdom. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars said: What is meant by the martyrdom of these people who are not killed for the sake of Allah is that in the Hereafter they will have the reward of martyrdom, but in this world their bodies should be washed and the funeral prayer should be offered for them. We have already discussed this in Kitab al-Eeman. The martyrs are of three types: the martyr in this world and the Hereafter, who is the one who is killed in war against the kuffar; the martyr in the Hereafter, who is not treated as a martyr as far as rulings in this world are concerned, who are the people mentioned here; and the martyr in this world who is not regarded as a martyr in the Hereafter, which is the person who steals from the war booty or who is killed when running away from the battlefield. 
End quote. 
Martyrdom is a high status, which can only be attained by the believers (Muslims). 
With regard to the one who heard the call of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and did not believe in him, he is a kafir who disbelieves in Allah and is one of the people of Hell, whether he was killed in battle or died in his bed, whether he was a Jew or a Christian or any other religion of shirk and kufr. The Christians are kafirs because they reject the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and because they claim that the Messiah ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (Jesus the son of Mary) is divine, and because they claim that God has taken a wife and a son – exalted be Allah far above what they say. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Indeed, those who disbelieve in Allah and His messengers and wish to discriminate between Allah and His messengers and say, ""We believe in some and disbelieve in others,"" and wish to adopt a way in between - Those are the disbelievers, truly. And We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment.”
[al-Nisa 4:150-151] 
“The Jews say, ""Ezra is the son of Allah ""; and the Christians say, ""The Messiah is the son of Allah ."" That is their statement from their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved [before them]. May Allah destroy them; how are they deluded?”
[al-Tawbah 9:30] 
“They have certainly disbelieved who say, "" Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary"" while the Messiah has said, ""O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord."" Indeed, he who associates others with Allah - Allah has forbidden him Paradise, and his refuge is the Fire. And there are not for the wrongdoers any helpers.”
[al-Maidah 5:72] 
“They have certainly disbelieved who say, "" Allah is the third of three."" And there is no god except one God. And if they do not desist from what they are saying, there will surely afflict the disbelievers among them a painful punishment.”
[al-Maidah 5:73] 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, no one of this nation, Jew or Christian, hears of me then dies without having believed in that with which I was sent, but he will be one of the people of Hell.” Narrated by Muslim, 153. 
The above comments have to do with the rulings on his situation in the Hereafter if he is killed. With regard to the rulings on his situation in this world, if a non-Muslim joins the fight to defend a Muslim country without that involving any compromise on religious matters on the Muslims’ part, then there is nothing wrong with thanking him and rewarding him for that.

39357,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39357,A brother’s responsibility towards his siblings at home,"My father works overseas, and I am the oldest son in the family. I live with my mother and siblings. Am I regarded as responsible for my siblings, in the sense that I should enjoin them to do what is good and forbid them to do what is evil, and do they have to obey me in that, or is this my mother’s responsibility? If my mother falls short in that and lets my siblings do some evil actions, what should I do?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil is obligatory upon you at all times, whether your father is there with you or he is absent from the home. It is also everybody’s responsibility, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand [by taking action]; if he cannot, then with his tongue [by speaking out]; and if he cannot, then with his heart [by hating it and feeling that it is wrong] – and that is the weakest of faith.” Narrated by Muslim, 78. 
Based on this, it is obligatory for all Muslims in general, and on fathers and mothers with their children in particular. If the father or mother falls short in that regard, then it is obligatory on the son, whether he is young or old, to do that to the best of his ability, with good manners and wisdom. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can”
[al-Taghaabun 64:16] 
And he also says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope”
[al-Baqarah 2:286]
You should pay attention to the best way of achieving the shar’i interests, and if the evil you are trying to ward off is greater than any evil that may result from your speaking up, then you should go ahead. You have to show them that you care about them and want what is best for them, so that this will make your advice more acceptable and they will do what you tell them, without doing that in a harsh or suppressive manner.

He replied: 
It is prescribed to write the Basmalah on invitations and other kinds of letters, because it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every matter of concern that is not started in the name of Allah is bereft of barakah (blessing).” And because he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to start his letters by mentioning the name of Allah.

Should we say the same as we say in the obligatory prayer?,"There is no specific Dhikr to be said in the two prostrations of forgetfulness (Sujud As-sahw). You can say what you say in the prostration in prayer such as (Subhan Rabbiy Al-a`la). Between the two prostrations, you can say ‘Rabbiy ighfir li’.",,"Praise be to Allah.There is no specific Dhikr to be said in the two prostrations of forgetfulness as far as we know. Based on this, they come under the same ruling as prostration in prayer, and the same should be said as in the prostration in prayer, such as Subhan Rabbiy Al-a’la (Glory be to my Lord Most High) and Du`a, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The closest a person can be to his Lord is when he is prostrating, so say a great deal of Du`a (at that time).” (Narrated by Muslim, 482) 
The same should be said between the two prostrations as is said between the two prostrations in prayer, namely “Rabbiy ighfir li (my Lord forgive me). 
Al-Nawawi said in Al-Majmu’ (4/72): 
“The prostration of forgetfulness is two prostrations, sitting in between them. It is Sunnah to sit Muftarishan (with the left foot lying along the ground and sitting on it) in between them, and to sit Mutawarrikan (with the left upper thigh on the ground and both feet protruding from one (i.e., the right) side) after them until one says the Salam. The way in which the prostrations are done and the Dhikr to be said in them is the same as in the prayer. And Allah knows best.” 
It says in Al-Sharh Al-Kabir (4/96): 
“He should say in the prostration of forgetfulness the same as he says in the prostration of prayer, by analogy with it.”
It says in Asna Al-Matalib (1/195): 
“The prostration of forgetfulness is two prostrations … the way in which they are done is the same as in prayer. He should sit Muftarishan between them, and recite the same Dhikr as in the prostration during the prayer.”
It says in Mughni Al-Muhtaj (1/439): 
“The way in which it is done is the same as in prayer, both obligatory and Nafl (supererogatory) prayers , such as putting the forehead on the ground and being at ease (in the posture)… and he should say the same Dhikr as in the prostration of prayer . 
Al-Athra`i said: “And they (scholars) did not say anything about the Dhikr to be said in between them. It seems that it is the same as the Dhikr between the two prostrations of the prayer.”
It says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Al-Da’imah (6/443): 
“When doing the prostration of forgetfulness and the prostrations required when reading the Quran, he should say the same as he says when prostrating during the prayer: “Subhan Rabbiy Al-a’la (Glory be to my Lord Most High)”. What is required is to say it once, but the least level of perfection is to say it three times. It is commendable to say Du`a whilst prostrating, saying whatever Du`as prescribed in Shari`ah one can say.”
Some of the scholars stated that it is commendable to say in these prostrations: “Subhana man la yanamu wa la yas-hu (Glory be to the One Who does not sleep or forget).” 
However, Ibn Hajar said in Al-Talkhis (2/12): “I could not find any basis for this.”
