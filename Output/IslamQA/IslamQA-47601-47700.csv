47618,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47618,Is it correct to read al-Sajdah and al-Mulk between Maghrib and ‘Isha’?Is there any saheeh report about the virtues of reciting three verses from Soorat al-An’aam?,Is there any report which speaks of reading Soorat al-Sajdah and Soorat al-Mulk between Maghrib and ‘Isha’? or about reciting three verses of Soorat al-An’aam immediately after Fajr prayer?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Before 
    replying to this question, we must establish an important point about the 
    virtues of certain soorahs. 
There are 
    fabricated ahaadeeth about the virtues of various soorahs which have been 
    falsely attributed to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him). Among the most famous of those who are known for that 
    are the following: 
1 – Nooh 
    ibn Abi Maryam al-Jaami’, of whom it was said: He encompassed everything 
    except the truth. He regarded it as permissible to tell lies in hadeeth in 
    the interests of the religion, and he made up ahaadeeth by himself and 
    attributed them to the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) concerning the virtues of the soorahs of the Qur’aan, soorah by 
    soorah. 
Abu ‘Ammaar 
    al-Husayn ibn Hurayth al-Marwazi said: It was said to Abu ‘Ismah – i.e., 
    Nooh ibn Abi Maryam - : “From where do you get (a hadeeth) from ‘Ikrimah 
    from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) concerning the virtues of 
    the Qur’aan soorah by soorah, when the companions of ‘Ikrimah have no such 
    hadeeth?” He said: “I saw that the people had turned away from the Qur’aan 
    and were distracted by the fiqh of Abu Haneefah and the Maghaazi of Muhammad 
    ibn Ishaaq, so I made up this hadeeth, seeing reward.” 
Narrated by 
    al-Haakim in al-Madkhal (p. 54); Ibn al-Jawzi in al-Mawdoo’aat 
    (16). Its isnaad is saheeh.
2 – 
    Maysarah ibn ‘Abd Rabbihi al-Faarisi, of whom Ibn Hibbaan said in 
    al-Majrooheen (2/345, no. 1038): He is the author of a lengthy hadeeth 
    about the virtues of the Qur’aan, in which it says: “Whoever recites such 
    and such will have such and such.” 
In 
    Lisaan al-Meezaan (7/198) by al-Haafiz ibn Hajar it says: In 
    al-Du’aafa’, Ibn Hibbaan narrated from Ibn Mahdi that he said: I said to 
    Maysarah ibn ‘Abd Rabbihi: “From where did you get these ahaadeeth, ‘Whoever 
    recites such and such will have such and such’?” He said: “I made them up in 
    order to encourage the people.”   
These are 
    examples of people who made up false ahaadeeth and attributed them to the 
    Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) for a purpose 
    that they thought fit, by means of which Iblees deceived them. 
The 
    scholars drew attention to the fact that the ahaadeeth which list the 
    virtues of all the soorahs of the Qur’aan soorah by soorah, are not proven. 
    Among those who drew attention to that was al-Mawsili in al-Mughni ‘an 
    al-Hifz wa’l-Kitaab (1/121). He said: And he narrated: “Whoever recites 
    such and such will have such and such… from the beginning of the Qur’aan to 
    the end. Ibn al-Mubaarak said: I think this was fabricated by the zindeeqs 
    (heretics). The editor – i.e., al-Mawsili – said: There is no saheeh report 
    concerning this. 
Attention 
    was also drawn to this by Ibn al-Qayyim in al-Manaar al-Muneef (p. 
    113-144) and Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd in al-Tahdeeth bima qeela Laa yasahhu 
    fihi hadeeth (p. 122-123). He added: It should be noted that the virtues 
    of the Holy Qur’aan and the virtues of certain soorahs and verses are known 
    from saheeh texts which are attributed to the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him). What Ibn al-Mubaarak and those who came 
    after him meant was to discuss the lengthy ahaadeeth which discuss the 
    soorahs of the Qur’aan soorah by soorah, such as the hadeeth which is 
    attributed to Ubayy ibn Ka’b (may Allaah be pleased with him), which was 
    quoted by some of the mufassireen – such as al-Tha’labi, al-Waahidi and 
    al-Zamakhshari – in their Tafseers, which is fabricated. This is what 
    is meant by the discussions of Ibn al-Mubaarak and others. And Allaah knows 
    best. End quote. 
Secondly: 
With regard 
    to the ahaadeeth that you asked about, the answer is as follows: 
Source of 
    the first hadeeth: 
It was 
    narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: 
    The Messenger of Allaah (S) said: “Whoever reads ‘Alif‑Laam‑Meem. The 
    revelation of the Book’ [al-Sajdah 32] and ‘Blessed be He in Whose Hand 
    is the dominion’ [al-Mulk 67], between Maghrib and ‘Isha’, it is as if 
    he spent Laylat al-Qadr in prayer.” 
This was 
    quoted by al-Suyooti in al-Durr al-Manthoor (6/535) at the beginning 
    of Soorat al-Sajdah. He said: “Ibn Mardawayh narrated from Ibn ‘Umar …” and 
    quoted it. 
al-Aloosi 
    quoted it in Rooh al-Ma’aani (21/116) from al-Suyooti, then he said: 
    A similar report was narrated by him – meaning al-Suyooti – and al-Waahidi 
    from the hadeeth of Ubayy ibn Ka’b, and by al-Tha’labi from the hadeeth of 
    Ibn ‘Abbaas. Wali al-Deen commented on that by saying: “I do not agree with 
    that; all of these reports are fabricated.” End quote. 
Several 
    versions of the hadeeth have been narrated, some of which are general in 
    meaning and do not specify a time for reading, and some of which do specify 
    a time, as in the report of Ibn ‘Umar. It has been narrated as marfoo’ and 
    mawqoof. Al-Ghaafiqi mentioned them in Lamahaat al-Anwaar (1127, 
    1129, 1140, 1141, 1142, 1143, 1144, 1146), except the report of Ibn ‘Umar. 
Commentary 
    on the second hadeeth: 
It was 
    narrated via two isnaads: 

    1-   
    
    From Ibn ‘Abbaas (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him) in a marfoo’ report: “Whoever recites when he 
    prays Fajr three verses from the beginning of Soorat al-An’aam up to the 
    words (interpretation of the meaning): ‘and He knows what you earn (good 
    or bad)’ [al-An’aam 6:3], forty thousand angels will come down to him 
    and the like of their deeds will be written for him. And there will be sent 
    to him an angel from seven heavens with an iron rod, and if the shaytaan 
    instils any evil in his heart he will strike him until there will be seventy 
    veils between him and him. When the Day of Resurrection comes, Allaah will 
    say: ‘I am your Lord and you are My slave, walk in My shade, and drink from 
    al-Kawthar, and wash in al-Salsabeel, and enter  
    Paradise without being brought to account or punished.’” 
This was 
    mentioned by al-Suyooti in al-Durr al-Manthoor (3/245-246). He said: 
    al-Salafi narrated it with a unreliable isnaad from Ibn ‘Abbaas as a marfoo’ 
    report, and al-Ghaafiqi mentioned it in Lamahaat al-Anwaar (941). 

    2-   
    
    It was narrated that 
    Ibn Mas’ood said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays Fajr in congregation and sits in 
    his prayer place, and recites three verses from the beginning of Soorat 
    al-An’aam, Allaah will appoint seventy angels for him who will glorify 
    Allaah and pray for forgiveness for him until the Day of Resurrection.” 
This was 
    quoted by al-Suyooti in al-Durr al-Manthoor (3/246) and he attributed 
    it to al-Daylami and al-Ghaafiqi in Lamahaat al-Anwaar (935) in a 
    version close to that of the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas. 
Al-Aloosi 
    said in Rooh al-Ma’aani (7/76), after quoting a number of ahaadeeth 
    and reports about Soorat al-An’aam, including the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas and 
    Ibn Mas’ood: And there are other reports, but most of that is da’eef (weak) 
    and some of it is mawdoo’ (fabricated), as is obvious. End quote. 
There is no 
    proven hadeeth which speaks of the virtues of Soorat al-An’aam. 
With regard 
    to Soorat al-Sajdah and al-Mulk, there is no proven report about reading 
    them between Maghrib and ‘Isha’, but there is a proven report about the 
    virtue of reciting Soorat al-Sajdah in Fajr prayer on Friday. 

    Al-Bukhaari (891) and Muslim (880) narrated 
    that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to recite in Fajr prayer on 
    Friday: “Alif‑Laam‑Meem. The revelation…” [al-Sajdah 32] and “Has 
    there not been over man a period of time…” [al-Insaan 76] . 
And 
    concerning the virtue of Soorat al-Mulk, it is narrated that it may be 
    recited when going to sleep or in general. Al-Tirmidhi (2891), Abu Dawood 
    (1400) and Ibn Maajah (3786) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: There is a soorah in the Qur’aan, with thirty verses, which 
    will intercede for its companion [the one who recites it] until he is 
    forgiven: “Tabaarak allaadhi bi yadihi’l-mulk (Blessed be He in Whose 
    Hand is the dominion)” [al-Mulk, 
    soorah 67]. Al-Tirmidhi said: This is a hasan hadeeth. 
Ibn Hajar 
    said in al-Talkhees (1/234): al-Bukhaari stated that there is a 
    problem with it in al-Tareekh al-Kabeer by noting that it is not 
    known that ‘Abbaas al-Jashami (who is the one who narrated it from Abu 
    Hurayrah) heard it from Abu Hurayrah. End quote. 
It was 
    classed as hasan by al-Albaani in some places and as saheeh in others. See:
    Saheeh Sunan Ibn Maajah, Saheeh Sunan Abi Dawood. Before him 
    al-Mundhiri said:  It was narrated by Abu Dawood, by al-Tirmidhi, who 
    classed it as hasan and this version was narrated by him, and by al-Nasaa’i, 
    Ibn Maajah, Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh, and by al-Haakim who said its 
    isnaad is saheeh. 
Al-Tirmidhi 
    (2892) narrated from Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not sleep until 
    he had recited “Alif‑Laam‑Meem. The revelation…” [al-Sajdah 32] and
    “Blessed is He in whose hand is dominion…” [al-
Mulk 67]

47627,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47627,"Their imam forgot a prostration then he repeated the rak’ah, but some of them did not repeat it","During ‘Isha’ prayer the imam led us in prayer, but he was not the official imam. In the last rak’ah he did not do the second prostration, and he said the salaam without anyone noticing it or reminding him. A few minutes later, one of the worshippers came and told him about that, so he got up straight away and said, “We will repeat the last rak’ah in order to do the prostration that was forgotten.” 

Is this correct? Is it was not correct, then what is the correct thing to do? What is the ruling on those who did not do the second prostration with them?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Firstly: 

    If the imam forgets something during the prayer, then the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded the 
    members of the congregation to remind him. He said: “I am only human like 
    you, and I forget as you forget, so if I forget then remind me.” Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 401. So the congregation in the mosque should have said tasbeeh 
    (“Subhaan Allaah”) so that the imam would notice and would do the second 
    prostration. 

    Secondly: 

    Both the first and second prostrations are pillars or 
    essential parts of the prayer, without which the prayer is not valid. 
    Whoever deliberately omits one or both of them has sinned, and his prayer is 
    invalid. Whoever forgets one or both of them has to do what he forgot when 
    he remembers it, whether he is leading a congregation, following an imam or 
    praying on his own. Whoever does not do that, his prayer is invalid. 

    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him) said: 

    The pillars or essential parts (of the prayer) are obligatory 
    and more important than the waajibat (obligatory parts of prayer), but they 
    differ from then in that the pillars are not waived if one forgets them 
    whereas the waajibaat are waived in that case and may be made up for by 
    doing the prostration of forgetfulness (sujood al-sahw), unlike the pillars. 
    Hence whoever forgets a pillar, his prayer is not valid without it. 

    Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 3/315 

    And he said: 
The evidence that the 
    pillars cannot be made up for by the prostration of forgetfulness is the 
    fact that when the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said the salaam after praying two rak'ahs of Zuhr or ‘Asr, he completed it 
    and did what he had omitted, and did the prostration of forgetfulness. This 
    indicates that the pillars of prayer cannot be waived by doing the 
    prostration of forgetfulness, and they must be done. 

    Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 3/323 

    With regard to what your imam did by repeating the final 
    rak’ah in full after being reminded, this is in accordance with one of the 
    two scholarly opinions on this matter, which is that the one who omits a 
    pillar or essential part of the final rak’ah and does not realize it until 
    after saying the tasleem should do the rak’ah in full. This is the view of 
    Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him). See al-Mughni, 1/658. 
This view was favoured 
    by Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), who was asked about an 
    imam who forget the final prostration in ‘Asr prayer. He stood up and 
    offered a complete rak’ah, then he said the tashahhud and the tasleem, then 
    he did the prostration of forgetfulness. He said: This is what is prescribed 
    in Islam. If the imam forgot a prostration and said the tasleem, then he 
    remembered it or it was pointed out to him, he should stand up and do a full 
    rak’ah, then say the salaam, then do the prostration of forgetfulness after 
    saying the salaam. This is better. The same ruling applies to one who is 
    praying alone. But if he does the prostration of forgetfulness before the 
    salaam, there is nothing wrong with that, but doing it after the salaam is 
    preferable. 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 
    11/277 

    The second view concerning this matter is that he does not 
    have to do the rak'ah in full, rather he should do the pillar that he forgot 
    and whatever comes after it. This is the view of Imam al-Shaafa’i (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him). See al-Majmoo’, 4/33. This view was 
    favoured by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him). See 
    Sharh al-Mumti’, 3/374. 
The point is that the 
    prayer of the imam, and the prayer of those who completed the prayer with 
    him, is valid. 

    But for those who did not complete the prayer and did not do 
    the prostration that was omitted, their prayer is not valid, and they have to repeat it.

47643,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47643,Can a person who travels and stays somewhere for one day join and shorten his prayers?,"I went with my father on a trip and we stayed for one day then we came back. During this day, could we join and shorten our prayers, or should we shorten them without joining them?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differed concerning the length of stay during which a traveller might shorten his prayers and if he stays longer than that he must offer the prayers in full. There are many different opinions. The four madhhabs say that if the traveller’s stay does not exceed three days, then he may avail himself of the concession granted to travellers. 
Ibn Rushd said: 
With regard to the differences of opinion concerning the period of stay in a place during which it is permissible for a traveller to shorten his prayers, there is a great deal of difference. Abu ‘Umar – meaning Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr – narrated approximately eleven different views, but the most well known views are those of the well known fuqaha’, among whom there are three opinions: 
1-The view of Maalik and al-Shaafa’i, which is that if the traveller decides to stay for four days, he should offer the prayers in full.
2-The view of Abu Haneefah and Sufyaan al-Thawri, which is that if he decides to stay for fifteen days, he should offer the prayers in full.
3-The view of Ahmad and Dawood, which is that if he decides to stay for more than four days he should offer the prayers in full.
The reason for this difference of opinion is that it is a matter concerning which sharee’ah is silent and using analogy is regarded as a weak method by all. Hence all of these scholars tried to quote as evidence for their views different scenarios which were narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), in which he stayed in a place and shortened his prayers or he applied the ruling of travel to a situation. 
Bidaayat al-Mujtahid, 1/122, 123 
Based on this, the case asked about here, which is that of a traveller who stays in a place for one day, does not fall into the area concerning which there is this difference of opinion among the imams, so he should shorten his prayers. 
Secondly: 
With regard to joining the prayers: if he is on the road, then it is better for him to join Zuhr and ‘Asr, and Maghrib and ‘Isha’, at the time of the earlier or later prayer according to what is easiest for him. 
When he has stopped in a place (such as when he has reached the city to which he is travelling, or he has stopped en route for a few hours to rest) then it is better for him not to join them, but if he does join them then there is no sin on him, because both options were narrated in saheeh reports from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
The apparent meaning of the words “on a journey during which it is permissible to shorten one’s prayers” is that it is permissible for a traveller to join his prayers whether he has stopped or is on the road. There is a difference of opinion among the scholars concerning this matter. 
Some of them said that it is not permissible for the traveller to join his prayers except whilst he is on the road, not when he has stopped. 
They quoted as evidence the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to join Maghrib and ‘Isha’ when he was travelling (when he was on the road).
 And they quote the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not join two prayers in Mina during the Farewell Pilgrimage, because he had made stop, but he was undoubtedly still a traveller because he shortened the prayers. 
The second view is that it is permissible for the traveller to join the prayers whether he has made a stop or is on the road. 
They quoted the following as evidence: 
1 – The fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) joined the prayers during the campaign of Tabook when he had made a stop. 
2 – The apparent meaning of the hadeeth of Abu Juhayfah which is proven in al-Saheehayn: that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made a stop in al-Abtah during the Farewell Pilgrimage, and he came out one day wearing a red hullah (suit) and led the people in praying Zuhr with two rak’ahs and ‘Asr with two rak’ahs. They said that the apparent meaning of this hadeeth is that these two prayers were joined. 
3 – The general meaning of the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas which says that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) joined Zuhr and ‘Asr, and Maghrib and ‘Isha’, in Madeenah when there was no fear and no rain. 
4 – That if it is permissible to join prayers in the case of rain etc, then it is more appropriate that it be permissible in the case of travel. 
5 – That it is difficult for a traveller to offer each prayer at its proper time, either because of inconvenience or because there is no water available, or for some other reason. 
The correct view is that it is permissible for the traveller to join his prayers, but it is mustahabb in the case of one who is on the road and is permissible but not mustahabb for one who has made a stop: if he joins his prayers there is nothing wrong with that but if he does not join them, that is better.

But if these banks are Islamic in name only and they deal with riba and other forbidden transactions, then dealing with them is haram, even if they call themselves “Islamic banks”, because what counts is what really happens, not mere names.

47652,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47652,Dyeing the hair black if there is no intention to cheat or deceive,"Is it permissible to dye the hair black if it was originally black? My hair is black but then its colour changed to red, and now I want to dye it black.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that dying the hair black is not allowed. That is mentioned in the hadith of Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) that Abu Quhaafah, the father of Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq, was brought to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to give his oath of allegiance, and his hair was completely white. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Change this, but avoid black.” Narrated by Muslim. 
Dyeing the hair black is not allowed, whether the hair was red or white. The scholars have stated that the reason why it is not allowed to dye the hair black is because of the deception involved, as it makes a person appear to be something he is not, especially since a person’s age may be known from the colour of his hair, whether it is black or white or a mixture of the two. So dyeing the hair black makes him look young when he may be middle aged or an old man. 
Based on this reason, if there are no white hairs and there is no intention to deceive, as in the case asked about here – where the questioner’s hair was black then its colour changed to red – is it permissible to dye the hair black? 
It better to be on the safe side and avoid that, because of the wording of the hadith and in accordance with it, especially since the reason mentioned – namely cheating and deception – is an implicit reason which some of the scholars stated was what was meant here, but it was not stated expressly by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
It should be noted that the Muslim woman understands the importance of time, and recognizes that this world is a preparation for the Hereafter.  So she should not spend much of her time or most of her time on matters of her body, clothing and adornments at the expense of her worship, educating her children, calling others to her religion and treating others with kindness. That does not mean that she should not adorn herself, rather she should adorn herself with that which Allah has permitted, within reasonable limits as regards how she does it and how much time she spends on that. 
Moreover she should not pay attention to every new thing that comes along, adopting and following every new fashion that she sees. That may lead her to imitate kaafir women and immoral women, let alone wasting time and money that she could put to better use which would be more beneficial to herself and to her ummah.

Or is it haram like hair extensions, or not?","It is permissible to have a hair transplant because it is aimed at correcting a fault, not at changing the creation of Allah.",,"Praise be to Allah.Hair transplant refers to moving the hair follicles from one area of a person’s head to another. The ruling on that is that it is permissible, because it is aimed at correcting a fault, not at changing the creation of Allah. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:  
Hair transplants are done for one who has become bald by taking hair from the back of the head and transplanting it in the bald spot . Is that permissible? 
He replied: 
“Yes, that is permissible, because this comes under the heading of restoring that which Allah has created, or correcting a fault; it does not come under the heading of cosmetic procedures or adding to what Allah has created, so it is not regarded as changing the creation of Allah . Rather it is restoring something that is lacking or removing a fault. There is the well-known story of the three people, one of whom was bald and said that he wished that Allah would restore his hair, so the angel touched him and Allah restored his hair and gave him beautiful hair.” (Al-Bukhari, 3277, and Muslim, 2964) (Fatawa ‘Ulama al-Balad al-Haram, p. 1185)

47672,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47672,Is it obligatory for those who embrace Islam in kaafir lands to migrate (hijrah)?,"What is the ruling on those who become Muslim in kaafir countries? Are they included in the hadeeth, “I have nothing to do with any Muslim who settles among the mushrikeen”? And does he have to migrate (hijrah)?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If a person becomes a Muslim in a kaafir land and he is not able to practise his religion openly and establish regular worship, or he fears for himself tribulation regarding his religious commitment, and he cannot protect his honour, then he is obliged to migrate, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I have nothing to do with any Muslim who settles among the mushrikeen. But if he is able to practise his religion openly and establish regular worship, and he is able to migrate, then it is mustahabb for him to migrate, but in this case it is not obligatory. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni: It is mustahabb for him (to migrate) so that he will be able to wage jihad against them – i.e., the kuffaar – and he will increase the numbers of the Muslims and support them. End quote. 
But if he is able to practise his religion openly, and he is safe from fitnah (tribulation, temptation), and he can call people to Allaah and teach the Muslims about their religion, then he may stay and not migrate, because his staying there serves an interest. When Maalik ibn al-Huwayrith (may Allaah be pleased with him) and his companions came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and stayed with him, when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) noticed that they were missing their families, he told them to go back and to teach their people, and he said: “Go back to your families and teach them.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6008; Muslim, 674.  
Al-Bukhaari (1452) and Muslim (1865) narrated from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri that a Bedouin asked the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about migration (hijrah) and he said: “Woe to you! Migration is very important. Do you have any camels?” He said: “Yes.” He said: “Do you pay zakaah on them?” He said: “Yes.” He said: “(Even) if you are in the remotest region, Allaah will not cause any of your deeds to be lost.” 
Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:  
“Allaah will not cause any of your deeds to be lost” means: He will never allow the reward for any of your deeds to be lost, no matter where you are.  
The scholars said that what is meant by the migration (hijrah) which this Bedouin asked about is staying close to Madeenah with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and forsaking one’s family and homeland. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) feared that he would not be able to bear that, and he would not fulfil his rights towards them, and that he would turn back (from Islam), so he said to him: This migration that you asked about is very important, but do good in your own land, and wherever you are it will benefit you, and Allaah will not allow anything of it to be lost. 
So migration depends on whether one is able to practise Islam openly and worship openly. If a person cannot do that and he fears fitnah (tribulation), then he must migrate; if he is able to practise Islam openly but he is able to migrate, then migration is mustahabb (recommended); if he is able to practise Islam openly and he engages in da’wah and teaches the Muslims, then he may stay. And Allaah knows best. May Allaah help us all to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.

47682,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47682,Ruling on singing the adhaan,Is it permissible to sing the adhaan?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is makrooh to sing 
      the adhaan in the sense of elongating the words excessively without 
      changing the meaning. If the meaning is changed then it becomes haraam and 
      the adhaan is not correct in this case. 

    Ibn Abi Shaybah (259) narrated that a muezzin gave the adhaan 
    and elongated the words in his adhaan and made it sound like singing. ‘Umar 
    ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez said to him: Give a gentle adhaan otherwise keep away 
    from us. 

    What is meant by a gentle adhaan is one without any singing 
    it. 

    See al-Maghrib fi Lughat al-Fiqh by Abu’l-Makaarim 
    al-Matrazi al-Hanafi (p 234) 

    It says in al-Mudawwanah (1/159): 
Maalik regarded it as 
    makrooh to sing the adhaan and disliked that intensely. 

    Imam al-Shaafa’i said in al-Umm (1/107): 

    I like the adhaan to be recited clearly without elongating 
    any words or rushing it. 

    It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah: 
The fuqaha’ are agreed 
    that elongating the words of the adhaan and singing it and adding any 
    elongation or letter at the beginning or the end is makrooh, because it is 
    contrary to proper focus and dignity. But if the singing and elongation  
    changes the meaning then it is haraam and there is no scholarly dispute on 
    this point, because it was narrated that a man said to Ibn ‘Umar: “I love 
    you for the sake of Allaah.” He said: “I hate you for the sake of Allaah, 
    for you sing the adhaan.” 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, 
    concerning adhaan that is sung, this means giving the adhaan with a tune as 
    if singing a song. It is valid but it is makrooh. 
And he said: But making 
    grammatical mistakesi n the adhaan falls into two categories, one which 
    renders the adhaan invalid, which is when the meaning is changed, and one in 
    which the adhaan is valid but is makrooh, which is when the meaning is not 
    changed. For example, if the muezzin says “Allaahu akbaar” (elongating the 
    ‘a’ sound), this is not valid because it changes the meaning, because akbaar 
    is the plural of kabar, which is a type of drum. 

    From al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 2/62 

    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said: Excessive elongation is not appropriate, and if the vowels are 
    elongated to such an extent that the meaning is changed, this is not valid, 
    otherwise it is makrooh. From Fataawa al-Shaykh, 1/125. 
The point is that singing 
    the adhaan is makrooh, and may render the adhaan invalid if it changes the 
    meaning.

47693,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47693,Is Ghusl Required If Semen Is Emitted without Desire?,"I suffer from a lot of discharge, and most of what is discharged is semen (fluid usually emitted at the point of climax) which may or may not be accompanied by feelings of desire, but semen is discharged several times a day, and I do Ghusl each time.
 Similarly, if I am not sure whether or not it is semen, I do Ghusl. I may end up doing Ghusl six times in one day, which makes me unable to pray on time.","The most correct view is that if semen is discharged without desire, Ghusl is not required but you have to do Wudu. If the discharge of semen is accompanied by feelings of desire, Ghusl is required according to scholarly consensus.",,"Praise be to Allah.Please note that if the discharge of semen is accompanied by feelings of desire, Ghusl is required according to scholarly consensus. (See Al-Majmu`, 2/111; Al-Mughni, 1/266)
With regard to semen being discharged without desire, the scholars differed concerning that. The most correct view is that if it is emitted without desire, Ghusl is not required but you have to do Wudu. 
The evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to `Ali ibn Abu Talib (may Allah be pleased with him): “If water gushes forth then Ghusl is required.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 206; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Al-Irwa’, 125. See also Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 1/278) “Gushes forth” means that it comes out forcefully, with feelings of desire. 
One has to distinguish between the kinds of discharge that come out; not every discharge that comes out of the private part is semen for which Ghusl is required . There is Wadiy (a fluid emitted after urination), semen (fluid emitted at the point of climax) and various discharges experienced by women. 
You have to know the difference between these and be able to distinguish between them. Madhiy and Wadiy do not necessitate Ghusl, rather what is required is to wash the private parts with water and do Wudu. 
It is proven that `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I was a man who used to emit a great deal of Madhiy, so I told Al-Miqdad ibn Al-Aswad to ask the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about that. He asked him and he said: `Wudu is required for that.’” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 132; Muslim, 303) 
These discharges are not impure, but they break Wudu
If the emission of semen is accompanied by feelings of desire , then Ghusl is required. If it is not accompanied by feelings of desire then Ghusl is not required. 
Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“The difference between semen and Madhiy is that semen is thick and has a smell, and it comes out in gushes when desire intensifies. Madhiy is a thin liquid that has no smell, and it does not gush out or come out when desire intensifies, rather it comes when desire has calmed down. 
Wadiy is a liquid that comes out after urinating, a few white drops that appear at the end of urination.
This is a description of these three things. 
With regard to the rulings on them, Wadiy is subject to the same rulings as urine, in all aspects. 
Madhiy is somewhat different to urine with regard to purification, because it is less impure, so it is sufficient to sprinkle water on it. So one should put water on the area (of the clothes) affected, without squeezing it or rubbing it. Similarly a man should wash his entire penis and testicles even if no Madhiy got on them. 
Semen is pure and there is no need to wash what it gets onto, unless that is to remove any marks or traces, but it necessitates Ghusl . Madhiy, Wadiy and urine, on the other hand, necessitate Wudu.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthyamin, 11/169)

But if the purpose is simply to make it more beautiful, then it is not permissible to do this cosmetic nose surgery.","Types of cosmetic surgery 


1 – Essential surgery 


Cosmetic surgery for the purpose of beautification","Praise be to Allah.Types of cosmetic surgery 
Cosmetic surgery may be divided into two categories: 
1 – Essential surgery 
These are operations that are done to remove faults, such as those that result from sickness, traffic accidents, burns, etc. or to remove congenital defects with which a person was born, such as to remove an extra digit or separate fused digits, etc. 
This kind of operation is permissible. There is evidence in the Sunnah to indicate that they are permissible and that the one who does them does not intend to change the creation of Allah. 
(i) ‘Arfajah ibn As’ad narrated that he lost his nose in the battle of al-Kulab during the Jahiliyyah, so he wore a nose made of silver but it became putrid, so the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told him to wear a nose made of gold. Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1770; Abu Dawud, 4232; al-Nasai, 5161. This hadith was classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albani in Irwa al-Ghalil, 824.
(ii) ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursing those women who pluck their eyebrows and file their teeth for the purpose of beautification and change the creation of Allah. Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim.
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
With regard to the phrase “those who file their teeth”, this refers to those who did that for the purpose of beautification and looking younger. This indicates that what is haram is that which is done for the purpose of beautification; but if it is needed for medical treatment or to correct a fault in the teeth and so on, there is nothing wrong with it. And Allah knows best. 
Cosmetic surgery for the purpose of beautification
2 – The second type of cosmetic surgery is that which is done for the purpose of beautification. 
These are operations that are done to improve the appearance in the eye of the beholder, such as making the nose look more beautiful by making it smaller, or making the breasts look more beautiful by making them smaller or larger, or facelifts, and so on. 
This kind of surgery is not for any necessary reason, rather the purpose is to change the creation of Allah and tinker with it according to people’s whims and desires. So this is haram and it is not permissible to do it, because it is changing the creation of Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They (all those who worship others other than Allah) invoke nothing but female deities besides Him (Allah), and they invoke nothing but Shaytan (Satan), a persistent rebel! Allah cursed him. And he [Shaytan (Satan)] said: ‘I will take an appointed portion of your slaves. ‘Verily, I will mislead them, and surely, I will arouse in them false desires; and certainly, I will order them to slit the ears of cattle, and indeed I will order them to change the nature created by Allah’” [al-Nisa’ 4:117-119]
The Shaytan is the one who tells people to change the creation of Allah. 
Please see: Ahkam al-Jarahah al-Tibbiyyah by Shaykh Muhammad al-Mukhtar al-Shanqiti. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
What is the ruling on cosmetic surgery? What is the ruling on learning the science of beautification? 
He replied: 
Cosmetic procedures are of two types: 
1 – Those which are done to remove a fault resulting from an accident etc. There is nothing wrong with that because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave permission to a man whose nose had been cut off in battle to wear a nose made of gold. 
2 – Those which are unnecessary and are not done to remove a fault but rather to increase beauty. This is haram and is not permissible, because the Messenger of Allah cursed women who pluck eyebrows, those who have their eyebrows plucked, those who fix hair extensions, those who have hair extensions done, those who do tattoos and those  who have tattoos done, because that is done as an enhancement and is not done to remove faults. 
With regard to the medical student who learns about cosmetic surgery during the course of his studies, there is nothing wrong with him learning that, but he should not do that in haram cases, rather he should advise those who ask for that to avoid it because it is haram. Perhaps if this advice comes from the lips of a doctor it will have more effect on a person. (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 4/412)
See also the answer to question no. 1006 . 
In conclusion, if there is some defect in the nose and the purpose of the cosmetic surgery is to remove that defect, then there is nothing wrong with that. 
But if the purpose is simply to make it more beautiful, then it is not permissible to do this surgery.
