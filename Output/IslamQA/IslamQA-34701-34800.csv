34701,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34701,The obligation to treat co-wives fairly in giving gifts,"I have two wives, and I want to buy some gold for one of them as a gift. Is it permissible for me to do that, or would this be unfair treatment of co-wives? Please note that I do not fall short in giving the other wife her rights.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Whoever has two or more wives has to treat them fairly. It is 
    not permissible for him to single out one of his wives with regard to 
    spending, accommodation or spending the night, to the exclusion of the 
    others. There is a stern warning issued to the one who has two wives and 
    does not treat them fairly. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever has two wives and inclines more towards 
    one of them than the other, will come on the Day of Resurrection with half 
    of his body falling.”  According to another version: “Dragging half of his 
    body which will be falling or leaning.” Narrated by Imam Ahmad in 
    al-Musnad, 2/295, 347, 471. A similar hadeeth was also narrated by 
    al-Nasaa’i and Ibn Maajah in their Sunans. 

    And it was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “Whoever has two wives and inclines more towards one of them, will 
    come on the Day of Resurrection with half of his body leaning.” Narrated by 
    Abu Dawood in his Sunan, 2/601. Al-Tirmidhi narrated something 
    similar in al-Jaami’. 

    This evidence indicates that it is obligatory to treat 
    co-wives fairly and equally, and that it is haraam for the husband to 
    incline more to one of them in a way that will hurt the other. This does not 
    include the inclination of the heart, for a person has no control over the 
    inclination of the heart. Hence the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to divide his time equally among his 
    wives, and he said: “O Allaah, this is my division of that which I can 
    control, so do not take me to task for that over which You have control and 
    I have no control” [meaning love in the heart]. 
Based on this, it is not 
    permissible for this husband to single out one of his wives with regard to 
    something over which he has control. If he gives a house etc to one of his 
    wives, he must treat all his wives equally in that regard, and give a 
    similar gift or something of equal value to all of them, unless the second 
    wife allows that.",Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (16/189)
34715,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34715,Falseness Hadeeth About Adam Praying by Virtue of the Prophet,"I read this hadeeth (prophetic narration) and I would like to know whether it is saheeh (authentic) or not.
“When Adam committed his sin, he said, ‘O Lord, I ask You by virtue of Muhammad to forgive me.’ Allah said, ‘O Adam, how do you know of Muhammad when I have not yet created him?’ He said, ‘O Lord, when You created me with Your own hand, and breathed into me the soul that You created, I raised my head and saw written on the pillars of the Throne, La ilaha ill-Allah Muhammad Rasool Allah [There is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the messenger of Allah]. Then I knew that You would not mention in conjunction with Your name any but the most beloved of Your creation to You.’ Allah said, ‘You have spoken the truth, O Adam. He is indeed the most beloved of My creation to Me. Pray to me by virtue of Him, for I have forgiven you. Were it not for Muhammad, I would not have created you.”",,,"Praise be to Allah.This hadeeth is mawdoo’ (fabricated). It was narrated by al-Hakim via ‘Abd-Allah ibn Muslim al-Fahri (who said), Isma’eel ibn Muslimah narrated to us, ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Zayd ibn Aslam told us, from his father, from his grandfather, from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), that he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “When Adam committed his sin…” Then he quoted the hadeeth as the questioner quoted it. 
Al-Hakim said: The isnad (chain of narrators) of this hadeeth is saheeh. 
This is what al-Hakim said! But a number of scholars rebuked him and denounced him for classing this hadeeth as saheeh. They ruled that this hadeeth is false and fabricated, and they pointed out that al-Hakim contradicted himself when commenting on this hadeeth. 
There follow some of their comments: 
Al-Thahabi said, criticizing the words of al-Hakim quoted above: 
Rather it is mawdoo’ (fabricated), and ‘Abd al-Rahman is not reliable, and I do not know who ‘Abd-Allah ibn Muslim al-Fahri is. 
Al-Thahabi also said in Meezan al-I’tidal: It is a false report. 
Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar agreed with him in Lisan al-Meezan. 
Al-Bayhaqi said:  
‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Zayd ibn Aslam is the only one who narrated it with this isnad, and he is da’eef (weak). Ibn Katheer agreed with him in al-Bidayah wa’l-Nihayyah, 2/323. 
Al-Albani said in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah, 25: (it is) mawdoo’. 
Al-Hakim himself (may Allah forgive him) accused ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Zayd of being a fabricator of hadeeth, so how could his hadeeth be saheeh? 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in al-Qa’idah al-Jaleelah fi’l-Tawassul wa’l-Waseelah (p. 69): 
Al-Hakim’s narration of this hadeeth is something for which he was denounced, and he himself said in his book al-Madkhil ila Ma’rifat al-Saheeh ‘an al-Saqeem:  
‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Zayd ibn Aslam narrated fabricated hadeeths from his father, and it is obvious to any competent hadeeth scholar that he is the one to blame for fabricating hadeeths. I say: ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Zayd ibn Aslam is da’eef (weak) because he made a lot of mistakes.

34718,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34718,Important and precise conditions for committing an evil action by force of necessity in order to serve the interests of the Muslims,"I am an employee working in a company. Sometimes the company sends us on training courses in our fields of specialization so that we can develop our skills and get promoted. 

But in these courses we are shown videotapes accompanied by music and sometimes they show women.  

Please note that these courses are very important, and if we do not attend them the people of bid’ah who hate the Sunnah and fight its followers will join them, because they work with us and thus they will be more entitled to promotion than us.  

My question is:  

What is the ruling on our going to courses like these?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Those who organize these courses should be 
    advised and directed to use permissible means that are free from music and images of women. If that is achieved then praise be to Allaah, but if 
    that is not achieved and the presence of good people in this institution will result in benefitting people and serving apparent interests of 
    the Muslims, and your continued presence or the development of your skills depends on your attending these courses, and that will block the 
    way to innovators and other deviants, and you are not attending solely for worldly purposes, but rather to serve the greater interests of the 
    Muslims, then perhaps your attendance in that case may be acceptable. But at the same time you should strive to lower your gaze and hate what you 
    see accidentally, and not enjoy the music. This means that you are committing the lesser of two evils, because if the good people are not promoted 
    to key positions, this will lead to the evildoers and corrupt people taking these positions, which will be a source of great mischief which should 
    be warded off, even if that involves committing a lesser evil. 
Our scholars have issued fatwas stating that 
    it is permissible to do things like that mentioned in the question, which is following the principle of doing the lesser of two evils so as to 
    ward off the greater evil. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy 
    on him) was asked by some military students about music in the army. He said (may Allaah have mercy on him): 
“Those brothers who hate music will be rewarded for their hatred by Allaah. If they are able 
    to remove it or reduce it, this is what is needed; if they are unable to do that then they should not forsake the greater interest which is 
    joining the army, because of this relatively lesser evil. A person should weigh up the pros and cons. If the good people fail to do this work 
    because of this sin, it will be left to the evildoers. You know how dangerous the army would be if there were no good people in it. I would not 
    like to give examples of what would happen if the evildoers and corrupt people were to take charge of the army and then seize power; there would 
    be such evil and corruption the extent of which only Allaah knows. So I encourage my religiously-committed brothers to join the army and to seek 
    the help of Allaah in reforming whatever they can. This evil – I mean the evil of music – is undoubtedly an evil in my view, even though there is 
    some difference of scholarly opinion concerning it as I have referred to above, but I say: this evil is relatively insignificant when compared to 
    the great interests that may be served by having religiously committed and righteous people in positions of leadership in the army.  
From Liqaa’aat al-Baab al-Maftoohah, 
    1/102, question no. 168. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on 
    him) was asked, after a speech that he gave to the students in the media department of the Arabic Language college: 
A Muslim journalist may be forced to attend 
    some parties or plays, so he attends even though there is music and disturbing scenes, so that he can explain its damaging effect on society. Is 
    he sinning thereby? 
He replied: 
If the aim is to serve the interests of the 
    public and not to enjoy the event, and the purpose of his attending it to warn against evil, and he enters this gathering or meeting in which 
    there are regrettable elements in order to find out about its evil and expose its faults for a good purpose, then there is nothing wrong with 
    that. But if he goes there for the purpose of enjoyment or for evil purposes, then he should not do that. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“And when you (Muhammad) see those who 
    engage in a false conversation about Our Verses (of the Qur’aan) by mocking at them, stay away from them till they turn to another topic”
[al-An’aam 6:68]
And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever believes in Allaah and the Last Day, let him not sit at a table where wine is being drunk.” Al-Tirmidhi, 2725. 
    Allaah describes those who sit with those who engage in a false conversation and do not denounce them as being like them.

34719,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34719,Is the Day of Reckoning one day?,Is the Day of Reckoning one day?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:  
The Day of Reckoning is one day, but it is a day whose length is equal to fifty thousand years, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“A questioner asked concerning a torment about to befall
Upon the disbelievers, which none can avert,
From Allah, the Lord of the ways of ascent.
The angels and the Rooh [Jibreel (Gabriel)] ascend to Him in a Day the measure whereof is fifty thousand years”
[al-Ma’aarij 70:1-4]
i.e., this torment will befall the disbelievers on a day the length of which is equal to fifty thousand years. 
In Saheeh Muslim it is narrated from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no owner of gold or silver who does not pay what is due on it (i.e., zakaah) but when the Day of Resurrection comes, plates of fire will be prepared for him and with them will be branded his forehead, his flanks and his back, and every time they cool down they will be reheated, on a Day the length of which is equal to fifty thousand years, until judgement is passed among the people.” 
This long Day is the day that will be hard for the kaafirs as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and it will be a hard Day for the disbelievers”
[al-Furqaan 25:26] 
“Truly, that Day will be a Hard Day —
Far from easy for the disbelievers” [al-Muddaththir 74:9-10]
What may be understood from these two verses is that it will be easy for the believer, and that is indeed the case. For this long Day with its horrors and serious matters will be made easy by Allah for the believer, but it will be hard for the kaafir.  I ask Allah to make me and my Muslim brothers among those for whom Allah will make the Day of Resurrection easy. 
But thinking too deeply about such matters of the unseen comes under the heading of extremism concerning which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Those who go to extremes are doomed, those who go to extremes are doomed, those who go to extremes are doomed .” 
Our duty with regard to the matters of the unseen is to submit and to accept them according to their apparent meaning, without discussing them in depth or trying to compare them to worldly things. For the matters of the Hereafter are not like the matters of this world; even if the meanings may have something in common, there is still a great difference between them. I will give the example of what Allah has told us about there being palm-trees, pomegranates, fruits, the flesh of birds, honey, water, milk, wine etc in Paradise, but He also tells us (interpretation of the meaning): 
“No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do” [al-Sajdah 32:17]
And Allah says in a hadeeth qudsi: “I have prepared for My righteous slaves that which no eye has seen, no ear has heard nor has it entered the heart of man.” 
There are things in this world that bear the same names as these blessings of Paradise mentioned here but the fact that they have a name in common does not mean that the wine of Paradise is like the wine of this world, or that the fruits of Paradise are like the fruits of this world, and so on. 
Although they may share a name and a common meaning, all the things of the unseen that share a meaning with things that are seen in this world are not like them in reality, so we should pay attention to this principle and accept the matters of the unseen according to the apparent meanings, and not try to do any more than that.  
Hence when Imam Maalik (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The Most Gracious (Allah) rose over (Istawa) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty)”
[Ta-Ha 20:5] –
How did He rise over it? He lowered his head and started to sweat, because of the seriousness of this question. Then he raised his head and spoke his famous words that became the standard comment regarding all the attributes that Allah has ascribed to Himself: “(The concept of) rising is not unknown, but how it happened (in the case of Allah) cannot be comprehended. Believing in it is obligatory and asking about it is bid’ah (an innovation).” 
Probing deeply into such matters is bid’ah because the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) who were more keen than us to seek knowledge and goodness did not ask the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) such questions, and they are sufficient as an example. What I have said now about the Last Day may also be applied to the attributes of Allah which He has ascribed to Himself of knowledge, power, hearing, seeing, speaking etc. The way in which these words apply to Allah is nothing like the way in which the same words apply to man. Each attribute suits the one to whom it is ascribed. Just as there is none like unto Allah in His Essence, there is none like unto Him in His attributes. 
In conclusion: the Last Day is one Day, and it will be hard for the kaafirs and easy for the believers. What has been narrated about the various kinds of reward and punishment is a matter which cannot be fully understood in this world, even though the basic meanings may be known to us in this world.","Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 2/40"

34725,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34725,Ruling on one who tells lies about the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him),What is the ruling on one who fabricates things about the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Telling lies about the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is a great evil and a serious sin, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Telling lies about me is not like telling lies about anyone else. Whoever tells lies about me deliberately, let him take his place in Hell.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1229. It was also narrated by Muslim in the Introduction to his Saheeh, without the phrase “Telling lies about me is not like telling lies about anyone else.” 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not tell lies about me, for whoever tells lies about me will enter Hell.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 106. And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever narrates a hadith from me that he thinks is false is one of the liars.” Narrated by Muslim (1). 
A number of scholars are of the view that the one who deliberately tells lies about the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is a kaafir. 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said in al-Fath: If it is said that lying is a sin except in cases where one is trying to bring about reconciliation and the like, and that Hell is threatened for those who sin, what is there to distinguish the one who tells lies about the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) from those who tell lies about anyone else? 
He answered this from two angles: 
1 – That according to one scholar, Shaykh Abu Muhammad al-Juwayni, the one who tells lies about him deliberately is a kaafir.  But this view was classed as da’eef (weak) by his son Imam al-Haramayn and those who came after him. Ibn al-Muneer, however, favoured this view, based on the idea that the one who tells lies about him by describing forbidden things as permissible, for example, either regards that forbidden thing as permissible or misleads others by making them believe that. Regarding forbidden things as permissible is kufr and leading others to kufr is also kufr. But this view is subject to further examination. The majority of scholars are of the view that this does not constitute kufr unless one believes that this forbidden thing is permissible.  
2 – That telling lies about him is a major sin, and telling lies about anyone else is a minor sin, so they are different. The fact that the same warning is given to the one who tells lies about him and the one who tells lies about anyone else does not necessarily mean that they will both end up in the same place or that if they do, they will stay there for the same length of time. The words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – “Let him take his place in Hell” – indicate that (the liar’s) stay there will be lengthy. Rather the apparent meaning is that he (the one who commits this sin) will not be brought forth from it because he no other abode. The definitive evidence shows that abiding therein (in Hell) for eternity is a punishment that is given only to the kuffaar. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) differentiated between telling lies about him and telling lies about anyone else and said: “Telling lies about me is not like telling lies about anyone else.”""(From al-Fath, 1/244)
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) discussed this matter at length and mentioned the ruling on one who tells lies about the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) verbally, the ruling on one who tells lies about him in a report and the ruling on one who narrates a hadith knowing it to be false. He was of the view that the one who tells lies about him verbally is a kaafir. He said in al-Saarim al-Maslool ‘Ala Shaatim il-Rasool (2/328-399), after quoting the hadith of Buraydah: 
A clan of Banu Layth in Madeenah was of two minds. A man had proposed marriage to one of their womenfolk during the Jaahiliyyah but they did not accept his proposal. He came to them wearing a hullah (a suit of clothing) and said: “The Messenger of Allah gave me this hullah to wear and told me to rule over your wealth and your blood.” Then he went and stayed with that woman whom he loved. The people sent word to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he said: “The enemy of Allah is lying.” Then he sent a man and said: “If you find him alive – although I do not think that you will find him alive – then strike his neck (kill him). And if you find him dead then burn him with fire.” He said: This is what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said concerning “one who tells lies about me deliberately.” Shaykh al-Islam said: “This is a saheeh isnaad according to the conditions of al-Saheeh and we do not find any fault in it.” 
Then he said: There are two opinions concerning this hadith: 
1 – That the apparent meaning should be followed and the one who deliberately tells lies about the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) should be killed. Among those who were of this view were some who said that the one who does that becomes a kaafir thereby. This was the view of several including Abu Muhammad al-Juwayni. Ibn ‘Aqeel quoted his Shaykh, Abu’l-Fadl al-Hamdaani, as saying: “The innovators, liars and fabricators of hadith are worse than the heretics because the heretics want to attack Islam from without but these people want to attack it from within. They are like people who try to destroy a city from within whilst the heretics are like those who are laying siege to it from without, and those who are inside open up the fortress. So they are more dangerous to Islam than those who do not appear outwardly to be Muslims.” 
The main point of this opinion is that telling lies about him (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) is tantamount to telling lies about Allah. Hence he said: “Telling lies about me is not like telling lies about one of you.” What the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded is what Allah commanded, and it must be followed just as the commands of Allah must be followed. Whatever he told us must be believed, just as whatever Allah told us must be believed. Whoever rejects what he told us or refuses to follow his command is like one who rejects what Allah told us or refuses to follow the command of Allah. It is well known that the one who tells lies about Allah by claiming to be a messenger or prophet of Allah, or tells false things about Allah, such as Musaylimah and other fabricators of his ilk, is a kaafir whose blood may be shed, and the same applies to one who tells lies about the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Thus it is clear that telling lies about him is tantamount to disbelieving in him. Hence Allah mentions the two things together in the verse where He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against Allah or denies the truth, when it comes to him?” [Al-‘Ankaboot 29:68]
Indeed, telling lies about him may be a greater sin than disbelieving in him, so Allah mentioned that first, just as the one who is sincere towards him is higher in status than one who believes what he says. If the liar is like the denier, or worse, then the one who tells lies about Allah is like the one who disbelieves in Him, and the one who tells lies about the Prophet is like the one who disbelieves in him.
 Thus it becomes clear that disbelieving in him is akin to lying, because denying what he says implies that one thinks that what he says is not true, which is tantamount to saying that the religion of Allah is false. It makes no difference whether one rejects one thing or everything that he says. Rather the person who does that becomes a kaafir because that implies that he thinks that the message and religion of Allah are false. And the one who tells lies about him deliberately introduces into the religion something that is not part of it, and claims that the ummah is obliged to believe this report and follow this command because it is the religion of Allah, knowing that it is not part of the religion of Allah. 
Adding something to the religion is like taking something away from it. There is no difference between rejecting a verse of the Quran or deliberately adding some words and saying that this is a soorah of the Quran. 
Moreover, if a person deliberately tells lies about him meaning to mock him or belittle him, by claiming that he issued commands that he did not issue, and that it is not permissible for him to issue, this is tantamount o attributing foolishness or false statements to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and claiming that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is a liar, and this is blatant kufr.
 If someone claims that Allah enjoined fasting of another month other than Ramadaan, or a sixth prayer, etc, or that bread and meat are haraam, knowing that he is lying, then he is a kaafir according to scholarly consensus. 
Whoever claims that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined something that he did not enjoin, or that he forbade something that he did not forbid, has told lies about Allah, like the one described (in the paragraph) above, with the additional factor that he clearly says that the Messenger said that. He is issuing a fatwa without pointing out that this is ijtihaad. In conclusion, whoever deliberately tells a blatant lie about Allah is like one who deliberately disbelieves in Allah and is even worse. It is obvious that the one who tells lies about the One Whom he should venerate is mocking Him and disregarding His sanctity. 
The one who tells lies about him (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) is inevitably seeking to dishonour and belittle him by lying. It is well known that the one who lies about him as Ibn Abi Sarh did when he said, “He used to learn from me,” or by attributing evil actions and foul words to him, becomes a kaafir thereby. The same applies to the one who tells lies about him, because he is attributing to him a command or a narrative or an action. If he attributes to him a command that he did not issue, he has added something to his sharee’ah, which cannot be part of it and which he could not have uttered, as he said: “I have not omitted anything that will bring you closer to Paradise but I have enjoined it upon you, and there is nothing that will keep you further from Hell but I have commanded you to do it.” If he did not enjoin it, then it is not permissible to enjoin it. Whoever narrates that he did enjoin it has attributed to him something that it is not permissible to enjoin and that is tantamount to attributing foolishness to him. 
Similarly, if he transmits a narrative from him, if this was something that he should have told us he would have told us, because Allah completed the religion. If he did not tell us of it then it is not something that he should have told us. Similarly with regard to actions that are falsely attributed to him; if the action is something that he should have done then he would have done it, but if he did not do it then it is better not to do it. 
The point is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the most perfect of mankind in all senses. Whatever he did not say or do, it is better not to say or do it, and whatever he did do, it is better to do it than not to do it. If a man deliberately tells a lie about him or narrates something from him that did not happen, then whatever he says is tantamount to attributing shortcomings to him, because if it was something good he would have done it, and whoever attributes shortcomings to the Messenger is a kaafir. 
It should be noted that this view is very strong but a distinction should be made between the one who tells lies about him verbally and the one who tells lies about him that he claims to have heard from someone else, such as saying: “So and so the son of So and so told me such and such from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” In this case he is telling lies about that man and attributing the hadith to him. But if he says “This hadith is saheeh” or “It was proven that he said that”, knowing it to be false, then he is telling lies about the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). But if he fabricates it and narrates it in silly manner, this is subject to further discussion, especially since the Sahaabah are regarded as being dignified and of good character and if one of them were to lie it would cause a great deal of harm to the religion. Therefore the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)  wanted to kill the one who told lies about him and he hastened to punish him so that would be means of preventing any of the hypocrites being counted as one of the Sahaabah of good character.
But if a person narrated a hadith knowing it to be false, this is haraam, as it was narrated in a saheeh hadith that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:  “Whoever narrates a hadith from me that he knows is false is one of the liars.” But he is not a kaafir unless he adds to that narration something that implies kufr, because he believes that his Shaykh narrated it, but he knows that his Shaykh is lying and it is not permissible for him to narrate it. So he is in the same position as one who witnesses a deal, a testimony or a contract knowing it to be invalid. This testimony is haraam, but he is not bearing false witness per se (shahaadat al-zoor). 
Then he mentioned the second view and said:  
2 – The liar is to be punished severely, but he is not regarded as a kaafir and it is not permissible to kill him, because the factors that determine who is a kaafir and is to be killed are well known and this is not one of them. It is not permissible to affirm something for which there is no basis. Whoever says that he is not to be executed has to stipulate that telling lies about the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) does not imply any criticism or defamation of him. But if he says that he heard him say something that implies belittling the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or criticizing him, such as the hadith about “the sweat of horses” and other such silly fabrications, this is obviously mocking him, and the one who says this is undoubtedly a kaafir whose blood may be shed. Those who were of the view that such a person is not to be executed responded to this hadith by saying that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) knew that he was a hypocrite so he killed him for that and not for lying, but this answer does not count for anything. 
Then he (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned some further points of refutation.

""She saw that she was walking with her lover in a garden full of thick trees. Thick trees were full of flowers and there branches were hanging down.

Though the above dream shows that they will get marry and there would be no problem for them but nothing's happened. But now her parents are not agree to marry her with him and they have also denied the Rishta two or three weeks ago. I want to ask you what exactly does this dream mean. Did she saw this dream because of istikhara or it was just because of thinking about that person whom she loves.",,,"Praise be to Allah.

    Secondly: 

    Dreams fall into three categories: 

    1-Those which come from Allaah. 
    These are a means by which Allaah gives glad tidings to His believing slaves 
    in this world after the cessation of Revelation.

    2-Those which come from the 
    Shaytaan, in which the Shaytaan tries to gain power over the sons of Adam 
    and cause distress to those who believe. The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) has taught us how to protect ourselves from 
    his evil, and he has told us that these dreams do not cause any harm to the 
    believer who observes the etiquette taught by the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him).

    3-Dreams that come from the 
    subconscious, in which the sleeper sees his own thoughts and ideas that 
    reflect what is happening in his day-to-day life, as mentioned in this 
    question.

    It seems that this sister is in love with this man and wants 
    to marry him, but her parents are refusing this marriage. So in her dream 
    she sees herself with her beloved as she would like to see him in real 
    life. 

    Finally, I advise the sister to fear Allaah and to obey her 
    parents in what is right and proper. She should strive to choose a husband 
    who is suited to her from among those who are righteous and trustworthy.  

    Similarly, she should ask Allaah to bless her with a 
    righteous husband who will make her happy, and may Allaah bless them with 
    righteous children who will be a help to them in this world and will store 
    up reward for them in the Hereafter.

Time went by and I did not offer expiation even though I know that I have sworn many such oaths and retracted. But after I did Hajj, praise be to Allah, I repented and I no longer swear oaths. Please advise me of the ruling on that.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is makrooh to swear oaths too often, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (O Muhammad) obey you not everyone Hallaaf Maheen (the one who swears much and is a liar or is worthless)”
[al-Qalam 68:10]
This condemnation implies that doing this is makrooh, as Ibn Qudaamah  (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni 13/439. 
If you swore oaths upon your children or others with the intention that they should do something or not do something, and they went against your wishes, then you have to offer expiation for every vow that was broken, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah will not punish you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He will punish you for your deliberate oaths; for its expiation (a deliberate oath) feed ten Masaakeen (poor persons), on a scale of the average of that with which you feed your own families, or clothe them or manumit a slave. But whosoever cannot afford (that), then he should fast for three days. That is the expiation for the oaths when you have sworn. And protect your oaths (i.e. do not swear much). Thus Allah makes clear to you His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) that you may be grateful”
[al-Maa'idah 5:89]
If the oath was sworn repeatedly concerning a single matter, then you have to offer one expiation; if the oaths had to do with a variety of matters, then you have to offer the same number of expiations as the things concerning which the oaths were sworn. 
If you do not know for certain how many oaths were sworn, then try to figure out the number, and offer expiation until you think that you have most likely done what is required of you. 
The expiation for breaking an oath (kafaarat yameen) is mentioned in the verse quoted above: feeding ten poor persons with the average food that you give your own family, or clothing them, or freeing a slave. You can choose any of these three options. If you are unable to do any of these three things, then you should fast three days for each oath in question. 
The Standing Committee was asked the following question: 
In the past I used to swear oaths stating that I would do such and such, then I did not do it. I want to offer expiation for that. Is it sufficient to offer one expiation? Please note that I swore such oaths several times but I do not remember how many they were. 
They replied: 
Try to figure out the number of oaths that you have broken, then offer expiation based on that approximate number, if the oaths had to do with different matters. If they all had to do with the same matter, such as saying, By Allah I will not visit Zayd, by Allah I will not visit Zayd,” then offer one expiation. 
From Fatawa Islamiyyah, 3/481. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz said: This applies to every vow to do one thing, or not to do one thing; even if it was repeated, only one expiation is due, provided that he did not offer expiation the first time and then repeat the mistake. But if he swore several vows to do different things or not to do different things, then he must offer expiation for each vow. For example, if he said: “By Allah I will not speak to So and so; by Allah I will not eat his food; by Allah I will not travel to such and such a place,” or he said, “By Allah I will certainly speak to So and so; by Allah I will certainly hit him,” and so on. 
What is required when feeding the poor in this case is to give each poor person half a saa’ of the local staple food, which is approximately one and a half kilograms. 
With regard to clothing, it means giving him what is needed for prayer, such as a shirt, or an izaar (lower garment, waist wrapper) and rida’ (upper garment, cloak). If he offers them dinner or lunch, that is good enough, because of the general meaning of the verse.

And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
34732,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34732,What Is Qadar in Islam?,What is the meaning of belief in al-Qadar (the divine will and decree)?,Qadar means that Allah has decreed everything that happens in the universe according to His prior knowledge and the dictates of His wisdom.,"What is Qadar?


Belief in al-qadar and free will","Praise be to Allah.What is Qadar?
Qadar means that Allah has decreed everything that happens in the universe according to His prior knowledge and the dictates of His wisdom. 
Belief in al-Qadar includes four things: 

The belief that Allah knows all things, in general and in detail, from eternity to eternity, whether that has to do with His actions or the actions of His slaves. 
The belief that Allah has written that in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz (the Book of Decrees). 

Concerning these two matters Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Know you not that Allah knows all that is in the heaven and on the earth? Verily, it is (all) in the Book (Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz). Verily, that is easy for Allah.” [al-Hajj 22:70]
In Sahih Muslim (2653), it is narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Allah wrote down the decrees of creation fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth.”  
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The first thing that Allah created was the Pen, and He said to it, ‘Write!’ It said, ‘O Lord, what should I write?’ He said: ‘Write down the decrees of all things until the Hour begins.” Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4700; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud. 

The belief that whatever happens only happens by the will of Allah – whether that has to do with His actions or the actions of created beings. 

Allah says concerning His actions (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And your Lord creates whatsoever He wills and chooses.” [al-Qasas 28:68] 
“and Allah does what He wills.” [Ibrahim 14:27] 
“He it is Who shapes you in the wombs as He wills.” [Aal ‘Imran 3:6]
And He says concerning the actions of created beings (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Had Allah willed, indeed He would have given them power over you, and they would have fought you.” [al-Nisa 4:90] 
“If your Lord had so willed, they would not have done it.” [al-An’am 6:112]
All events, actions and happenings occur only by the will of Allah. Whatever Allah wills happens, and whatever He does not will does not happen.  

The belief that all things that happen are created by Allah in their essence, their attributes and their movements. 

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the Wakil (Trustee, Disposer of affairs, Guardian) over all things.” [al-Zumar 39:62] 
“He has created everything, and has measured it exactly according to its due measurements” [al-Furqan 25:2]
And Allah tells us that the Prophet of Allah Ibrahim (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to his people: 
“While Allah has created you and what you make.” [al-Saffat 37:96 – interpretation of the meaning]
If a person believes in all these things then he believes correctly in the divine will and decree (al-qadar). 
Belief in al-qadar and free will
Belief in al-qadar as we have described it above does not contradict the idea that a person has free will with regard to actions in which he has free choice. He can choose whether to or not to do things that he is able to do of acts of worship or sinful actions. Shari’ah and real life both indicate that people have this will. 
With regard to shari’ah, Allah says concerning man's will (interpretation of the meaning): 
“That is (without doubt) the True Day. So, whosoever wills, let him seek a place with (or a way to) His Lord (by obeying Him in this worldly life)!.” [al-Naba 78:39] 
“so go to your tilth, when or how you will.” [al-Baqarah 2:223]
And He says concerning man’s ability (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.” [al-Taghabun 64:16] 
“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned.” [al-Baqarah 2:286]
These verses confirm that man has a will and the ability to do what he wants and not to do what he does not want.  
With regard to real life, everyone knows that he has a will and the ability to do what he wants and not to do what he does not want. And he can distinguish between the things that happen when he wants them to, such as walking, and those that happen without him wanting them to, such as shivering. But the will and ability of man are subject to the will and decree of Allah, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“To whomsoever among you who wills to walk straight.  And you cannot will unless (it be) that Allah wills the Lord of the ‘Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists).” [al-Takwir 81:28-29]
But the entire universe is the dominion of Allah, and nothing can happen in His dominion without His knowledge and will. 
And Allah knows best.

Can you help me?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.In the saheeh Sunnah are narrated du`as and adhkaar which you can recite during the rituals of ‘Umrah, and from which the Muslim can benefit by memorizing them, understanding them and acting upon them. These include the following: 
A – At the meeqaat when entering ihraam: 
It is Sunnah for the Muslim to recite tasbeeh (saying “Subhaan-Allah (glory be to Allah)”), tahleel (saying “Laa ilaaha ill-Allah (there is no god but Allah)”) and takbeer (saying “Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great)”) before entering ihraam for ‘Umrah or Hajj. 
It was narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed Zuhr with four rak’ahs when we were with him in Madeenah, and he prayed ‘Asr in Dhu’l-Hulayfah with two rak’ahs, then he stayed there overnight. When morning came he rode until he reached al-Bayda’, then he praised, glorified and magnified Allah. Then he recited Talbiyah with the intention of performing Hajj and ‘Umrah and the people did likewise. 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1476. 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said: 
This ruling – that it is mustahabb to recite tasbeeh and the other (adhkaars) mentioned before ihraam – is something that not many people do even though it is proven in the Sunnah. 
Fath al-Baari, 3/412 
B – On the way to Makkah, between the meeqaat and arrival in Makkah: 
It is Sunnah to recite the Talbiyah a great deal and to raise one’s voice – for men; women should recite in a low voice so that no non-mahram men will hear them. 
It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) set out riding from the mosque of Dhu’l-Hulayfah, he recited the Talbiyah and said: “Labbayk Allahumma labbayk, labbayka laa shareeka laka labbayk, inna al-hamda wa’l-ni’matah laka wa’l-mulk, laa shareeka lak (Here I am, O Allah, here I am. Here I am, You have no partner, here I am. Verily all praise and grace and dominion are Yours, You have no partner).” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5571; Muslim, 1184 
C – During Tawaaf 
Every time you come in line with the Black Stone in each circuit, say, “Allahu akbar.” Al-Bukhaari (1613) narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) circumambulated the House, and every time he came to the corner (i.e., the Black Stone), he pointed to it with something he had in his hand and said takbeer. 
Between the Yemeni Corner and the Black Stone you should say the words that were narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Saa’ib, who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say between the two Corners: “Rabbana aatina fi’l-dunya hasanah wa fi’l-aakhirah hasanah wa qina ‘adhaab al-naar (Our Lord, give us that which is good in this world and that which is good in the Hereafter, and protect us from the torment of the Fire).” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1892; classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
D- Before climbing up al-Safa and when atop it: 
It was narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah said: … then he (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) went out through the gate to al-Safa and when he drew near to al-Safa he recited: “Verily, As-Safa and Al-Marwah (two mountains in Makkah) are of the Symbols of Allah” [al-Baqarah 2:158 – interpretation of the meaning], (and he said:) “I begin with that with which Allah began.” He began with al-Safa and climbed it until he could see the House, then he turned to face the qiblah and proclaimed the Oneness of Allah and magnified Him, and said: “Laa ilaaha ill-Allah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadeer; Laa ilaaha ill-Allah wahdahu anjaza wa’dah wa nasara ‘abdah wa hazama al-ahzaaba wahdah (There is no god but Allah alone, with no partner or associate, His is the dominion and to Him be praise, and He is able to do all things; there is no god but Allah alone, He fulfilled His promises and granted victory to His slave and defeated the confederates alone).” Then he made du`a between that and repeated this three times. 
Narrated by Muslim, 1218, 
E – When climbing al-Marwah 
You should do the same as you did when climbing al-Safa, without reciting the verse before starting to climb. 
Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said:  Then he came down towards al-Marwah and when his feet reached the bottom of the valley he ran until the ground started to rise, then he walked until he came to al-Marwah, and he did at al-Marwah as he had done at al-Safa. Narrated by Muslim, 1218. 
When drinking Zamzam water, you may say du`a asking for the best of this world and the Hereafter, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The water of Zamzam is for whatever it is drunk for.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 3062; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in 5502. 
Similarly it is prescribed to remember Allah a great deal (dhikr), which includes du`a, during tawaaf and saa’i, so the Muslim should make du`a as Allah inspires him. There is nothing wrong with reciting Qur’aan during tawaaf and saa’i. What some people say, that there are special du`as for each circuit of tawaaf and saa’i is something for which there is no basis in sharee’ah. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
It is mustahabb during tawaaf to remember Allah and call upon Him in ways that are prescribed in sharee’ah. If one recites Qur’aan there is nothing wrong with that. There is no specific dhikr that has been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), that he either enjoined, said or taught to others. Rather (the pilgrim) may say any du`a that is prescribed in sharee’ah. What many people say, that there is a specific du`a to be recited beneath the downspout of the Ka’bah and so on has no basis. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to end his tawaaf between the two Corners by saying,  “Rabbana aatina fi’l-dunya hasanah wa fi’l-aakhirah hasanah wa qina ‘adhaab al-naar (Our Lord, give us that which is good in this world and that which is good in the Hereafter, and protect us from the torment of the Fire),” as he used to finish all his du`as with these words, and there is no specific du`a for that, according to scholarly consensus.

34745,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34745,What is a woman permitted to uncover in front of other women and mahrams?,"What is your opinion of what many women do nowadays, whereby they wear very short clothes when they are with other women and there are no men present? Some of these clothes show a large part of the back and stomach, or they wear these short clothes (like shorts) in front of their children at home?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas issued a statement on this matter, which reads as follows: 
, the Lord of the Worlds, and blessings and peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and upon all his family and companions. 
The believing women at the beginning of Islam were extremely pure, chaste, and modest, which was the blessing of belief in Allah and His Messenger and following the Quran and Sunnah. Women at that time used to wear concealing garments, and it is not known that they used to uncover themselves when they met one another or when they met their mahrams. The women of this ummah followed this mode of behaviour – praise be to Allah – generation after generation until recently, when corruption and impropriety entered the way women dress and behave for many reasons, which we do not have room to discuss here. 
Because of the large number of questions that have been sent to the Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas about women looking at women, and what women should wear, the Committee is telling all Muslim women that women are obliged to have an attitude of modesty, which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) described as being part of faith and one of the branches of faith. One aspect of the modesty which is enjoined by Islam and by custom is that women should cover themselves, be modest and adopt an attitude and conduct that will keep her far away from falling into fitnah (temptation) and doubtful situations. 
The Quran clearly indicates that a woman should not show to other women anything other than that which she shows to her mahrams, that which she customarily uncovers in her own home and when doing housework, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“…and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband’s fathers, or their sons, or their husband’s sons, or their brothers or their brother’s sons, or their sister’s sons, or their (Muslim) women (i.e. their sisters in Islam)…” [al-Noor 24:31]
If this is the text of the Quran and this is what is indicated by the Sunnah, then this is what the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the womenfolk of the Sahaabah used to do, and the women of the ummah who followed them in truth until the present day.What was usually uncovered in front of the people mentioned in this verse is what women usually uncover when they are at home and when doing housework, which is difficult to avoid, such as uncovering the head, hands, neck and feet.
With regard to going to extremes in uncovering, there is no evidence in the Quran and Sunnah that this is permissible. This is also the way that leads to a woman tempting or being tempted by other women, which happens among them. It also sets a bad example to other women, as well as being an imitation of kaafir women, prostitutes and immoral women in the way they dress. It was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” Narrated by Imam Ahmad and Abu Dawood. In Saheeh Muslim (2077) it is narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw him wearing two garments dyed with safflower, and he said, “These are from the clothing of the kuffaar – do not wear them.” 
It is also narrated in Saheeh Muslim (2128) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are two types of the people of Hell whom I have not seen: people with whips like the tails of cattle, with which they beat the people, and women who are clothed yet naked, misguided and leading others astray, with their heads like the humps of camels, leaning to one side. They will not enter Paradise or even smell its fragrance, although its fragrance may be detected from such and such a distance.”  
The meaning of the phrase “clothed yet naked” is that the woman is wearing clothes that do not cover her, so she is clothed, but in fact she is naked, such as when she wears a thin dress that shows the colour of her skin, or a dress that shows the outline of her body, or a short dress that does not cover part of her limbs. 
So what Muslim women have to do is to adhere to the guidance followed by the Mothers of the Believers (the Prophet’s wives) and the womenfolk of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them), and the women of this ummah who followed them in truth, and strive to cover themselves and be modest. This is farthest removed from the causes of fitnah and will protect them from the things that lead to provocation of desires and falling into immorality. 
Muslim women must also beware of falling into that which Allah and His Messenger have forbidden of imitating kaafir women and prostitutes, in obedience to Allah and His Messenger, and in the hope of attaining the reward of Allah, and for fear of His punishment. 
Every Muslim must also fear Allah with regard to the women who are under his care, and not let them wear things that Allah and His Messenger have forbidden, such as provocative clothes, or clothes that are revealing or tempting. He should remember that he is a shepherd and will be responsible for his flock on the Day of Resurrection. 
We ask Allah to set the Muslims’ affairs straight, and to guide us all to the straight path, for He is All-Hearing, Ever-Near and Ever Responsive. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and companions.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 17/290)
It also says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (17/297): 
What a woman is permitted to uncover in front of her children is that which is customarily uncovered, such as the face, hands, forearms, feet and so on.

As for taking off their clothes in a safe place, such as in her family’s house or her mahram’s house, to change her clothes and the like, or to relax etc and for other permissible purposes that are far removed from fitnah, there is nothing wrong with that.

    mosques. The best of all mosques is al-Masjid al-Haraam (The Sacred Mosque in Makkah), then al-Masjid al-Nabawi (the Prophet’s Mosque in 
    Madeenah), then al-Masjid al-Aqsa. 
These three mosques are the three for which 
    it is prescribed to travel for the purpose of worship. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do not travel 
    (specifically) to any mosque except three: al-Masjid al-Haraam, Masjid al-Aqsa, and this mosque of mine.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1996. 
One prayer in al-Masjid al-Aqsa is equivalent 
    to two hundred and fifty prayers offered elsewhere. 
It was narrated that Abu Dharr (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: We were discussing when we were with the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), which is 
    better, the Mosque of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). The Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “One prayer in my mosque is better than four prayers offered there (in Bayt 
    al-Maqdis), and what a good place of prayer it is. Soon there will come a time when, if a man has a piece of land the size of a horse’s rope from 
    which he can see Bayt al-Maqdis, that will be better for him than the whole world.” Narrated by al-Haakim, 4/509; he classed it as saheeh and 
    al-Dhahabi and al-Albaani agreed with him, as it says in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, at the end of the discussion on hadeeth no. 2902. 
One prayer offered in the Prophet’s Mosque is 
    equivalent to one thousand prayers (offered elsewhere), so one prayer offered in al-Masjid al-Aqsa is equivalent to two hundred and fifty 
    prayers. 
With regard to the well-known hadeeth that 
    says that one prayer offered there is equivalent to five hundred prayers, this hadeeth is da’eef (weak). See Tamaam al-Minnah by Shaykh 
    al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him), p. 292. 
Secondly: 
A Haram or sanctuary comes under special rulings which were prescribed by Allaah. 
For example: it is haraam to fight therein; 
    it is haraam to hunt the animals and birds that live there; it is haraam to cut down the plants that grow there naturally by the will of Allaah 
    and have not been planted by anyone. 
Allaah blessed the people of Makkah by making 
    Makkah a sanctuary and safe place for them, in which both people and animals are safe. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Have We not established for them a secure 
    sanctuary (Makkah), to which are brought fruits of all kinds, a provision from Ourselves, but most of them know not”
[al-Qasas 28:57]
“Have they not seen that We have made 
    (Makkah) a secure sanctuary, while men are being snatched away from all around them?”
[al-‘Ankaboot 29:67] 
“whosoever enters it, he attains security”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:97]
Muslim (1362) narrated that Jaabir said: The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Ibraaheem made Makkah a sanctuary, and I have made Madeenah a sanctuary… its 
    branches are not to be cut and its animals are not to be hunted.” 
The word that is translated as “branches” 
    here refers to every kind of tree that has thorns. If it is haraam to cut down the trees that have thorns then it is more appropriate that those 
    that do not have thorns should not be cut down. 
And Muslim (1374) narrated that Abu Sa’eed 
    al-Khudri said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O Allaah, Ibraaheem made Makkah sacred and made it a 
    sanctuary, and I have made Madeenah a sanctuary… no blood is to be shed therein, no weapon for fighting is to be carried, and no tree is to be 
    struck to make its leaves fall, except to provide food for animals…” 
Al-Nawawi said: 
This shows that it is permissible to take the 
    leaves of plants to provide food for animals. What is meant here is that taking the leaves is haraam except for this purpose. 
Al-Quds (Jerusalem) is not a sanctuary in 
    this sense, according to the consensus of the Muslims. People use this word (Haram or sanctuary) in a very broad sense, to such an extent that 
    they call al-Quds a sanctuary, and the Mosque of Ibraaheem al-Khaleel in Palestine a sanctuary, and even universities are called sanctuaries. 
    There are no sanctuaries on earth apart from those in Makkah and Madeenah, and a valley in al-Taa’if called Wujj concerning which the scholars 
    differed as to whether it was a sanctuary or not. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in 
    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 27/14-15: 
Bayt al-Maqdis is not a place that can be 
    called a sanctuary (haram), nor is the Tomb of al-Khaleel or any other place on earth, except for three: 
The first is a sanctuary according to the 
    consensus of the Muslims. This is the sanctuary of Makkah, which Allaah has honoured. 
The second is a sanctuary according to the 
    majority of scholars. This is the sanctuary of the Prophet (i.e., in Madeenah). This is a sanctuary according to the majority of scholars such as 
    Maalik, al-Shaafa’i and Ahmad. There are many saheeh hadeeth concerning this narrated from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him). 
The third is Wujj, which is a valley in 
    al-Taa’if. There is a hadeeth concerning this that was narrated by Ahmad in al-Musnad, not in the books of Saheeh. This is a 
    sanctuary according to al-Shaafa’i because he believed the hadeeth to be saheeh, but it is not a sanctuary according to the majority of scholars. 
    Ahmad classed as da’eef (weak) the hadeeth that was narrated concerning this and did not accept it. 
Places other than these are not sanctuaries 
    according to any of the Muslim scholars. The sanctuary is that in which Allaah has forbidden hunting and cutting its plants, and Allaah has not 
    forbidden hunting and cutting plants in any places except these three.

34752,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34752,Hadeeth Concerning the Virtue of Praying Forty prayers in the Prophet’s Mosque,"I heard that whoever prays forty prayers in the Prophet’s Mosque, it will be recorded that he is free of hypocrisy. Is this hadeeth (prophetic narration) saheeh (authentic)?",,,"Praise be to Allah.This hadeeth was narrated by Ahmad (12173) from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who is reported to have said, “Whoever prays forty prayers in my Mosque, missing no prayer, it will be recorded that he is safe from the Fire, is saved from punishment and is free of hypocrisy.” This is a da’eef (weak) hadeeth. 
This was mentioned by al-Shaykh al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah (364), who said: It is da’eef. He also mentioned it in Da’eef al-Targheeb (755) and said, it is munkar (a kind of weak hadeeth). 
Al-Albani said in his book Hujjat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) (p.185) that it is an innovation (bid’ah) to visit Madeenah and tell the visitors to Madeenah to stay there for a week so that they will be able to offer forty prayers in the Prophet’s Mosque so that they will be free from hypocrisy and saved from the Fire. 
Al-Shaykh Ibn Baz said: 
With regard to the widespread idea that the visitor should stay for eight days so that he can offer forty prayers in the Mosque is wrong. Although it says in some hadeeths, “Whoever offers forty prayers therein Allah will decree that he is safe from the Fire and free from hypocrisy,” this hadeeth is da’eef according to the scholars and cannot be taken as proof or relied upon. There is no set limit for visiting the Prophet’s Mosque. If a person visits for an hour or two, or a day or two, or for more than that, there is nothing wrong with that. 
Fatawa Ibn Baz, 17/406 
Instead of this hadeeth we should look at the hasan (sound) hadeeth narrated by al-Tirmithi (241) concerning the virtue of always being present for the opening takbeer (saying Allahu Akbar) of prayer in congregation. It was narrated that Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Whoever prays for forty days with the congregation, always being present for the first takbeer, it will be written that he will be safe from two things: he will be safe from the Fire and safe from hypocrisy.” Classed as hasan by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmithi, 200. 
The virtue mentioned in this hadeeth is general and applies to any mosque where prayers are offered in congregation, in any land; it does not apply only to al-Masjid al-Haram [in Makkah] or al-Masjid al-Nabawi [in Madeenah] in particular. 
Based on this, whoever consistently prays forty days in congregation in which he is present for the first takbeer, it will be recorded that he will be safe from two things: safe from the Fire and safe from hypocrisy, whether the mosque is in Madeenah, Makkah or anywhere else.

    of commands and prohibitions and they do not pay attention to the basis and reasons behind these rulings. They are called Zaahiris (literalists) 
    for this reason, because they go by the apparent meaning and do not pay attention to shar’i bases, wisdom and analogies which are indicated by the 
    Qur’aan and Sunnah. But in general their way is better than the way of those who only refer to reasoning, analogy and arguments, and who do not 
    pay much attention to the shar’i evidence of the Qur’aan and Sunnah. But they are falling short and are to be criticized for focusing only on the 
    apparent meanings of the texts and not paying enough attention to the bases, wisdom and reasoning which the Lawgiver referred to and the objects

34770,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34770,There is no compulsion to accept Islam,"Some friends say that whoever does not enter Islam, that is his choice and he should not be forced to become Muslim, quoting as evidence the verses in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed, all of them together. So, will you (O Muhammad) then compel mankind, until they become believers”
[Yoonus 10:99] 
“There is no compulsion in religion”
[al-Baqarah 2:256] 
What is your opinion concerning that?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars explained that these two verses, and other similar verses, have to do with those from whom the jizyah may be taken, such as Jews, Christians and Magians (Zoroastrians). They are not to be forced, rather they are to be given the choice between becoming Muslim or paying the jizyah. 
Other scholars said that this applied in the beginning, but was subsequently abrogated by Allah’s command to fight and wage jihad. So whoever refuses to enter Islam should be fought when the Muslims are able to fight, until they either enter Islam or pay the jizyah if they are among the people who may pay jizyah. The kuffaar should be compelled to enter Islam if they are not people from whom the jizyah may be taken, because that will lead to their happiness and salvation in this world and in the Hereafter. Obliging a person to adhere to the truth in which is guidance and happiness is better for him than falsehood. Just as a person may be forced to do the duty that he owes to other people even if that is by means of imprisonment or beating, so forcing the kaafirs to believe in Allah alone and enter into the religion of Islam is more important and more essential, because this will lead to their happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. This applies unless they are People of the Book, i.e., Jews and Christians, or Magians, because Islam says that these three groups may be given the choice: they may enter Islam or they may pay the jizyah and feel themselves subdued. 
Some of the scholars are of the view that others may also be given the choice between Islam and jizyah, but the most correct view is that no others should be given this choice, rather these three groups are the only ones who may be given the choice, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fought the kuffaar in the Arabian Peninsula and he only accepted their becoming Muslim. And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But if they repent [by rejecting Shirk (polytheism) and accept Islamic Monotheism] and perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and give Zakaah, then leave their way free. Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Tawbah 9:5]
He did not say, “if they pay the jizyah”. The Jews, Christians and Magians are to be asked to enter Islam; if they refuse then they should be asked to pay the jizyah. If they refuse to pay the jizyah then the Muslims must fight them if they are able to do so. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Fight against those who (1) believe not in Allah, (2) nor in the Last Day, (3) nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger  (Muhammad), (4) and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued”
[al-Tawbah 9:29]
And it was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) accepted the jizyah from the Magians, but it was not proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or his companions (may Allah be pleased with them) accepted the jizyah from anyone except the three groups mentioned above. 
The basic principle concerning that is the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and polytheism, i.e. worshipping others besides Allah), and the religion (worship) will all be for Allah Alone [in the whole of the world]”
[al-Anfaal 8:39] 
“Then when the Sacred Months (the 1st, 7th, 11th, and 12th months of the Islamic calendar) have passed, then kill the Mushrikoon (see V.2:105) wherever you find them, and capture them and besiege them, and lie in wait for them in each and every ambush. But if they repent [by rejecting Shirk (polytheism) and accept Islamic Monotheism] and perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and give Zakaah, then leave their way free. Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”

Women in foreign countries may find it hard to wash their heads every time after janaabah and this may be a stumbling block that prevents them from becoming Muslim because they fix their hair in a certain style that may be affected by washing.,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is well known from the sharee’ah and from the words of the scholars that wiping over things that cover the skin, such as the socks, turban and headcover is not permissible when doing ghusl from janaabah, according to scholarly consensus. Rather it is permissible during wudoo’ only, because of the hadeeth of Safwaan ibn ‘Assaal (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us, when we were travelling, not to remove our socks for three days and nights, except in the case of janaabah, but not in the case of defecation, urination or sleep.” Undoubtedly the Islamic sharee’ah is the sharee’ah of tolerance and ease. There is no great difficulty involved in washing the head in the case of janaabah, because when Umm Salamah asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about doing ghusl from janaabah and menstruation, she said, “O Messenger of Allah, I have braided hair, do I have to do it every time I do ghusl from janaabah and menstruation?” He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to her, “Rather it is sufficient for you to pour water over your head three times, then pour water all over your body, and you will be taahir (pure).” Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh. 
Based on this, women who find it difficult to wash their heads when doing ghusl from janaabah should be told that it is sufficient for them to pour over their heads three times so that the water reaches all of the hair, without them having to undo their braids or change anything of the hairstyle that it would be difficult to change.  They should also be told about the great reward that they will have from Allah and the good consequences and pleasant life that they will enjoy forever in Paradise if they are patient in adhering to the rulings of sharee’ah. 
But in the case of things that cover the skin that a person needs in the case of a broken limb or injury, it is permissible to wipe over them when doing both ghusl and wudoo’, because this is a case of necessity, and there is no time limit in this case, so long as there is a need for that. Jaabir narrated a hadeeth about a man who suffered a head wound, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ordered that a piece of cloth be placed over his wound and he should wipe over that, then wash the rest of his body. This was narrated by Abu Dawood in his Sunan. 
It is a good idea to point out to those who are interested in Islam, when they find some matters difficult to understand or they find some rulings hard to accept, that Paradise is surrounded with difficulties and Hell is surrounded with desires, and that Allah has issued His commands to His slaves in order to test them and see if they will do well. Earning the Lord’s pleasure and gaining the honour of admittance to His Paradise is not something that is easy in all aspects or something that a person can attain without any difficulty. It is not like that at all. Rather we have to be patient and strive to overcome our nafs (self), and put up with a lot of difficulties in order to please our Lord, be honoured by Him and be saved from His wrath. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, we have made that which is on earth as an adornment for it, in order that We may test them (mankind) as to which of them are best in deeds [i.e. those who do good deeds in the most perfect manner, that means to do them (deeds) totally for Allah’s sake and in accordance to the legal ways of the Prophet]” [al-Kahf 18:7] 
“Who has created death and life that He may test you which of you is best in deed” [al-Mulk 67:2] 
“And surely, We shall try you till We test those who strive hard (for the Cause of Allah) and As-Saabiroon (the patient), and We shall test your facts (i.e. the one who is a liar, and the one who is truthful)” [Muhammad 47:31]

We ask Allah to make us and you among those who call others to true guidance, who bring the Muslims back to the straight path, and bless us all with insight into the purpose for which we were created, and to increase the numbers of daa’iyahs among us, for He is Able to do all things.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat li’l-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 6/237"
34778,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34778,What Is the Purpose of Hajj?,"I watched scenes of the pilgrims on TV, and saw them coming to visit the sacred House of Allah. I was overwhelmed and my eyes filled with tears when I saw this great scene, and I wished that I could be with them and do this great deed. 
My question is this: does this great gathering have any effect on the Muslims and the people of Islam? What should the pilgrim remember when he is facing the sacred House of Allah?","There are many purposes of Hajj in Islam, some of which are: 1- Hajj is the symbol of Tawhid; 2- Hajj is a reminder of the Hereafter; 3- Hajj is a symbol of unity; 4- Hajj trains him to be content with modest clothing and accommodation.",,"Praise be to Allah.We thank you for your question and appreciate your concern. We ask Allah to bless those who perform Hajj with forgiveness of sins, and for those who have not done Hajj we ask Him to grant them what they hope for and save them from that which they fear. 
The aims and purposes of Hajj are great and sublime. There follows an outline of some of them: 
1. A sense of connection with the Prophets (peace be upon them) from our father Ibrahim who built the House, to our Prophet Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and his respect for the sanctity of Makkah. When the pilgrim visits the sacred places and performs the rituals, he remembers the visits of those pure prophets to this sacred place.
Muslim (241) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said: We traveled with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) between Makkah and Madinah, and we passed by a valley. He said, “What valley is this?” They said, “The valley of al-Azraq.” He said, “It is as if I can see Musa, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), putting his fingers in his ears beseeching Allah, reciting the Talbiyah and passing through this valley.” 
Then we traveled on until we came to a mountain pass. He said, “What mountain pass is this?” They said, “Harsha or Lift.” He said, “It is as if I can see Yunus on a red camel, wearing a woollen cloak, the reins of his camel made from fibres of date-palm, passing through this valley reciting the Talbiyah.”  
2. The whiteness and cleanness of the pilgrims’ clothes is a sign of inward purity, cleanness of heart and the purity of the message and the method. This means putting aside all adornment and showing humility, and it is a reminder of death when the deceased is shrouded in similar cloths. So it is as if he is preparing to meet Allah.  
3. Entering ihram from the miqat is a physical expression of worship and enslavement to Allah, and of submission to His commands and laws. No one passes it (without entering ihram) because it is a command from Allah and a law that He has prescribed. This confirms the unity of the ummah and its following one system with no differentiation or exemptions with regard to the definition of the miqats.  
4. Hajj is the symbol of Tawhid from the first moment the pilgrim enters ihram. Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah said, describing the Hajj of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Then he started to say the words of Tawhid, ‘“Labbayka Allahumma labbayk, labbayka la sharika laka labbayk. Inna al-hamd wa’l-ni’mata laka wa’l-mulk, la sharika lak  (Here I am, O Allah, here I am. Here I am, You have no partner, here I am. Verily all praise and blessings are Yours, and all sovereignty, You have no partner).’” (Narrated by Muslim, 2137; please see question no. 21617) 
5. Hajj is a reminder of the Hereafter when all the people come together in one place in ‘Arafah and elsewhere, with no differentiation between them. All of them are equal in this place and no one is better than anyone else. 
6. Hajj s a symbol of unity, because Hajj makes all people the same in their clothing, deeds, rituals, qiblah and the places they visit. So no one is better than anyone else, king or slave, rich or poor, are all the same. 
So the people are equal in terms of rights and duties. They are equal in this sacred place, and differences in colour and nationality do not matter; no one has the right to differentiate between them.  
Unity of feelings, unity of rituals.
Unity in purpose, unity in action. 
Unity in words. “People come from Adam, and Adam came from dust. No Arab is superior to a non-Arab and no white man is superior to a black man, except in terms of piety (taqwa).” 
More than two million Muslims all standing in one place, wearing the same clothes, sharing one aim, with one slogan, calling upon one Lord and following one Prophet… What unity can be greater than this? 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, those who disbelieved and hinder (men) from the path of Allah, and from Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah) which We have made (open) to (all) men, the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there [as regards its sanctity and pilgrimage (Hajj and ‘Umrah)] — and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong (i.e. practise polytheism and leave Islamic Monotheism), him We shall cause to taste from a painful torment.” [al-Hajj 22:25]
7. Hajj trains him to be content with modest clothing and accommodation, when he wears two pieces of cloth and it is sufficient for him, and his accommodation gives him just enough room to sleep.  
8. Terrifying the disbelievers and followers of misguidance with this huge gathering of Muslims. Even though they are scattered and different, the simple fact that they come together despite those differences at a certain time and in a certain place is indicative of their potential to unite at other times and in other places. 
9.Pointing out the importance of Muslims coming together and establishing harmony. For we usually see each person travelling on his own, whereas in Hajj we see people coming in groups. 
10. Getting to know the situation of the Muslims from trustworthy sources, since the Muslim can hear directly from his brother about the situation of his Muslim brothers in the land from which he has come. 
11. Exchanging benefits and experience among the Muslims in general. 
12. Meeting scholars and decision makers from all countries and studying the situation and needs of the Muslims, and the importance of cooperating with them. 
13. Achieving true submission to Allah by standing in the holy places when the pilgrim leaves al-Masjid al-Haram which is the best of spots, and standing in ‘Arafah. 
14. Forgiveness of sins, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does Hajj and does not speak any obscene words or commit any sin will go back cleansed of sin as on the day his mother bore him.” 
15. Opening the doors of hope to those who commit sin, and teaching them to give up their sin in these holy places, so that they will give up a lot of their bad habits during the period of Hajj and its rituals. 
16. Proclaiming that Islam is the religion of organization, because during Hajj the rituals and time are organized, with every action done in the place and at the time defined for it. 
17. Training oneself to spend in charitable ways and to avoid miserliness. The pilgrim spends a great deal of money for the sake of Hajj, on travel expenses, on the road and in the sacred places. 
18. Increasing piety and making the heart fit to honour the Symbols of Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and whosoever honours the Symbols of Allah, then it is truly, from the piety of the hearts.” [al-Hajj 22:32]
19. Training the rich to give up their distinct clothing and accommodation and making them equal with the poor in clothing and in the rituals of tawaf, sa’i and stoning the jamarat. This teaches them to be humble and to realize the insignificance of this worldly life. 
20. The pilgrim persists in worshipping and remembering Allah during the days of Hajj, moving from one sacred place to the next, from one action to another. This is a kind of intensive training in worship and remembrance of Allah. 
21. Training oneself to be kind to people – so the pilgrim guides those who are lost, teaches those who are ignorant, helps the poor, and supports the disabled and weak. 
22. Developing good characteristics such as forbearance and putting up with annoyance from people, because the pilgrim will inevitably be exposed to crowding and arguments, etc. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The Hajj (pilgrimage) is (in) the well-known (lunar year) months (i.e. the 10th month, the 11th month and the first ten days of the 12th month of the Islamic calendar, i.e. two months and ten days). So whosoever intends to perform Hajj therein (by assuming Ihram), then he should not have sexual relations (with his wife), nor commit sin, nor dispute unjustly during the Hajj.” [al-Baqarah 2:197]
23. Training oneself to be patient and to put up with difficulties such as heat, long distances, being apart from one’s family, going back and forth between the holy sites and crowded conditions therein. 
24. Learning to give up one's usual habits and the things that one is comfortable with, because the pilgrim has to uncover his head and give up his regular clothes, and leave behind the accommodation, food and drink that he is used to. 
25. When the pilgrim does sa’i between al-Safa and al-Marwah, he remembers that the one who obeys Allah and puts his trust in Him and turns to Him, He will not let him down, rather He will raise high the esteem in which he is held. When Hajar the mother of Isma’il (peace be upon them both) said to Ibrahim, “Has Allah commanded you to do this?” he said, “Yes.” She said, “Then He will not let us down.” So Allah raised high the esteem in which she was held and the people, including the prophets, started to run between the two hills as she had done. 
26. Teaching oneself not to despair of the mercy of Allah, no matter how great one's worries and distress. For the way out is in Allah’s Hand. The mother of Isma’il thought her son was about to die, and she started to run from one mountain to the other, looking for a solution, and it came to her from a source she could never imagine when the angel came down and struck the ground, and out came the water of Zamzam with its healing for diseases of the heart and body. 
27. The pilgrim remembers that in doing these rituals he is the guest of the most Merciful. The gathering of Hajj is not at the invitation of any government or organization or king or president, rather it is the invitation of the Lord of the Worlds Who has made it an occasion on which the Muslims meet on a footing of equality in which no one is superior to anyone else. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And proclaim to mankind the Hajj (pilgrimage). They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel, they will come from every deep and distant (wide) mountain highway (to perform Hajj).
That they may witness things that are of benefit to them (i.e. reward of Hajj in the Hereafter, and also some worldly gain from trade).” [al-Hajj 22:27-28]
Al-Nasai (2578) narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The guests of Allah are three: the warrior for the sake of Allah, the pilgrim performing Hajj and the pilgrim performing ‘Umrah.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Nasai, 2464)                    
28. Strengthening bonds with the believers, as represented in the words of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Your blood, your honour and your wealth are sacred to you as this day of yours in this month of yours in this land of yours is sacred.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 65; Muslim, 3180. 
29. The season of Hajj is distinguished by complete separation from the people of shirk and kufr who are forbidden to attend any part of it. It is forbidden for them to enter the Haram at any time, no matter what their purpose. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe (in Allah’s Oneness and in His Messenger Muhammad)! Verily, the Mushrikun (polytheists, pagans, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah, and in the Message of Muhammad) are Najasun (impure).  So let them not come near Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah) after this year; and if you fear poverty, Allah will enrich you if He wills, out of His Bounty. Surely, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.” [al-Tawbah 9:28]
Al-Bukhari narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: “Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) sent me as an announcer on that Hajj [which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) appointed Abu Bakr to lead in 9 AH], to announce on the Day of Sacrifice in Mina that after this year no mushrik might perform Hajj and no one might circumambulate the House naked.”

34780,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34780,Is Fasting Shawwal Disliked?,"What do you think of fasting six days after Ramadan in the month of Shawwal? It says in Muwatta’ Malik that Imam Malik ibn Anas said concerning fasting six days after breaking the Ramadan fast that he had not seen any scholar or Faqih fasting these days, and he had not heard of any of the Salaf doing that, and that the scholars regarded that as Makruh and feared that it was a Bid`ah, and that this is joining to Ramadan something that is not part of it. This appears in Al-Muwatta’, no. 228, part one.",An authentic Hadith indicates that fasting six days of Shawwal is Sunnah. It is not correct to oppose this Hadith with the reasons that some scholars cite for this fast being disliked such as the fear that an ignorant person might think that this is part of Ramadan or the fear that people may think this is obligatory.,,"Praise be to Allah.The Standing Committee for Fatwa and Research said:
“It was proven from Abu Ayyub (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever fasts Ramadan then follows it with six days of Shawwal , that is the fasting of a lifetime .” (Narrated by Ahmad, 5/417; Muslim, 2/822; Abu Dawud, 2433; At-Tirmidhi, 1164) 
This is an authentic Hadith which indicates that fasting six days of Shawwal is Sunnah . Ash-Shafi`i, Ahmad and a number of leading scholars followed this. 
It is not correct to oppose this Hadith with the reasons that some scholars cite for this fast being disliked, such as the fear that an ignorant person might think that this is part of Ramadan, or the fear that people may think this is obligatory, or that he did not hear that one of the earlier scholars used to fast these days, because this is all speculation, which cannot be used to oppose the authentic Sunnah. If something is known, this is evidence against those who do not know. And Allah is the Source of strength.” (Fatwa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah Lil Buhuth Wal Ifta’, 10/389)

34784,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34784,Why does the imam say the takbeer in the Eid prayer?,"Why is it Sunnah for us to say ten takbeers in the Eid prayers before reciting al-Faatihah? What is the benefit of that, and why do we do it in these prayers and not in the five obligatory prayers?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The basic principle concerning acts of worship is to worship in the manner enjoined by Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), whether we know the reason behind it or not, especially in the case of prayer, fasting and Hajj. Reasoning has nothing to do with it. This includes the six or seven takbeers which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prescribed following the opening takbeer and before the recitation of al-Faatihah in the first rak’ah of the Eid prayer, and the five takbeers before the recitation of al-Faatihah in the second rak’ah of the Eid prayer, but not in the five daily prayers. 
We must believe in what Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) have prescribed, and submit to it; we should hear and obey, because the basic principle in this matter is to worship Allah and not to look for reasons.  
A person has no right to interfere in matters that are the unique preserve of Allah, such as worship and what kinds of worship are to be done and in what manner. He should not ask why has Allah prescribed some things and not others, or what is the benefit of this that He has prescribed. Rather he should learn what Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) have prescribed, and act in accordance therewith. If the reason behind it becomes apparent to him, then praise be to Allah; if not, he should submit to the rule of Allah and obey Him, and have certain faith that Allah has only prescribed things for a reason and in the best interests of his slaves, because He is Most Wise and All-Knowing in all that He says and does, prescribes and decrees. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Certainly your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing” [al-An’aam 6:83]
What we have said is supported by the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow”
[al-Ahzaab 33:21]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Pray as you have seen me praying.” Narrated by al-Bukhari in his Saheeh. 
And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said during his Farewell Pilgrimage, “Learn your rituals from me.” Narrated by Muslim, 378.

34791,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34791,Uncles of one’s parents are mahrams,Can a woman uncover in front of her father's mother's brother?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The brother of your grandmother on your 
    father’s side is the maternal uncle of your father, and a man’s maternal uncle is regarded as a maternal uncle for all his descendants. Based on 
    that, your father’s maternal uncle is a maternal uncle for you, so he is one of your mahrams and you do not have to observe hijab in front of him. 
    Rather it is permissible for you to uncover in front of him that which is usually uncovered in front of mahrams. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
Note that a person’s maternal or paternal aunt is a maternal or paternal aunt for him and for 
    all those who are descended from him. So your father’s paternal aunt is a paternal aunt for you, and your father’s maternal aunt is a maternal 
    aunt for you; your mother’s paternal aunt is a paternal aunt for you and your mother’s maternal aunt is a maternal aunt for you. Similarly the 
    paternal aunts of your grandfathers and grandmothers are paternal aunts for you, and the maternal aunts of your grandfathers and grandmothers are 
    maternal aunts for you.

Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was also asked: 
Is it permissible for a woman to uncover in 
    front of her mother’s paternal or maternal uncle, or her father’s paternal or maternal uncle – in other words are these persons counted as mahrams? 
He replied: Yes, if a woman’s mother or father has a paternal uncle who is her father’s full 
    brother or half brother through either his father or his mother, or she has a maternal uncle, then he is one of her mahrams, because your father’s 
    paternal uncle is a paternal uncle for you, and your father’s maternal uncle is a maternal uncle for you. Similarly your mother’s paternal uncle 
    or maternal uncle are uncles for you through ties of blood.
