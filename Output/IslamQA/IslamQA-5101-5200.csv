      was the name of the Prophet's (S) camel?",,,"Praise be to Allah. Imaam
      Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his section on the

 Of
      camels he had al-Qaswaa’, and it was said that she was the camel on

      al-‘Adbaa’ and al-Jad’aa’ one and the same, or two different

      Al-‘Adbaa’ was the camel who had never been defeated in a race, then a
      Bedouin came on a young camel, which beat her in a race. This upset the

5105,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5105,Refutation of those who try to prove that the Qur’aan is not true,"Recently I became aware of some scholarly research done by German scholars into the inerrancy of the Quran. Some of their findings are discussed in an Atlantic Monthly article entitled ""What Is the Koran?"" written by Toby Lester, published in the January 1999 issue of that magazine. The gist of their research is that some very old fragments of the Quran found in a mosque in Yemen show small but significant aberrations from the standard Quranic texts. In some cases, the writing on the fragments found had been washed off and different writing substituted overtop. The article tries to cast doubt on the Muslim view of the Quran as being absolutely reliable, and tries to show instead that it is a literary text that has been subject to change just like any other. 

I am not a Muslim, but I know that the Quran holds a position in Islam that is similar to that of Christ in Christianity. In view of this, sir, how would you respond to these attempts to dispute the absolute inerrancy of the Quran? In your view, do these scholars have false motives that render their findings untrustworthy? Or do you have another response to these attacks on the verity of the Quran?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    1 – The proof that the copies of the Holy Qur’aan that we 
    have before us is not just one or two pieces of evidence, rather it is 
    proven by a vast amount of evidence that no fair-minded person can study 
    without becoming convinced that it is exactly as Allaah revealed it to 
    Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 

    2 – There have been generations coming one after another, 
    reciting the Book of Allaah and studying it, memorizing it and writing it 
    down. They have not omitted a single letter, and no one can change even the 
    vowel point of a single letter. Writing is just one means of preserving it; 
    basically it is preserved in their hearts. 

    3 – The Qur’aan has not come down to us on its own, such that 
    the so-called alterations could be made. Rather the interpretation of its 
    verses, the meanings of its words, the reasons for its revelation, the 
    grammar of its words and the commentary on its rulings have all been 
    transmitted. When such care has been given to this Book, how could sinful 
    hands find a way to distort even one letter of it, or add a word, or take 
    away a verse? 

    4 – The Qur’aan speaks of matters of the unseen, in the 
    future, which Allaah revealed to His Messenger Muhammad  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) to show him that they came from Allaah. If 
    a human being wants to write a book, he can describe an event or express a 
    point of view, but if any human being were to speak about matters of the 
    unseen, in this field he can only base that on speculation and lies. But the 
    Qur’aan told of the defeat of the Romans by the Persians, at the time when 
    there was no means of communication to inform the Arabs of this event. The 
    same verses also foretold that they (the Persians) would be defeated after a 
    certain number of years. If what the Qur’aan said was not accurate, then the 
    kaafirs would have had a great opportunity to criticize the Qur’aan. 

    5 – If you read any verse of the Qur’aan, then you go to 
    America or Asia or the jungles of Africa, or to the deserts of Arabia or any 
    place where there are Muslims, you will find that all of them have the exact 
    same verse, memorized by heart or in their books; not a single letter of it 
    will have been altered.  

    So what is the importance of this unknown manuscript in Yemen 
    which we have not seen, and in which some ignorant may have altered, in 
    recent times, one verse or one word? 

    Does this argument carry any weight when properly researched 
    and discussed? Especially when the people claim to be fair-minded and 
    objective in their research.  

    What would be their response if we went to one of their most 
    trusted books by a well-known author, a book of which there are many copies 
    in the world, all of them exactly the same, and we claimed that there was a 
    copy of this book in some country or other in which there was extra material 
    and alterations, and it was different from what is in their copies? Would 
    they pay any attention? 

    Their answer would be the same as ours. 

    6 – The manuscript copies which are in the Muslims’ 
    possession cannot be proven to be authentic in this simplistic manner, for 
    we have experts who know the history of calligraphy and we have principles 
    and guidelines through which we may determine whether a manuscript is 
    genuine, such as the names and signatures of the people who heard it and 
    read it.  

    We do not think that these features are present in this 
    so-called copy of the Qur’aan in Yemen or in others. 

    7 – We are happy to conclude our answer with this true story 
    that happened in Baghdad during the ‘Abbasid era, when a Jew wanted to find 
    out how true are the books attributed by their followers to God, namely the 
    Torah among the Jews, the Gospel among the Christians and the Qur’aan among 
    the Muslims. 

    He went to the Torah and added and took away a few minor 
    things that were not very obvious, then he gave it to a scribe from among 
    the Jews and asked him to make copies of it. It did not take long before 
    these copies were placed in the synagogues of the Jews and were in 
    circulation among their major scholars. 

    Then he went to the Gospel and added and took away a few 
    things as he had done with the Torah, and he gave it to their scribes and 
    asked them to make copies of it. It was not long before it was being read in 
    their churches and was in circulation among their scholars. 

    Then he went to the Qur’aan and added and took away a few 
    things as he had done with the Torah and the Gospel. Then he gave it to a 
    Muslim scribe to make copies of it. 

    When he went back to get his copy, the scribe threw it in his 
    face and told him that this was not the Qur’aan of the Muslims! 

    From this experiment the man came to know that the Qur’aan is 
    the true Book of Allaah and that all other books were the works of human 
    beings. 

    If the scribes of the Muslims could tell that this copy had 
    been tampered with, then how could it go into circulation among the Muslim 
    scholars undetected? 

    If the questioner wants to repeat this ancient experiment 
    nowadays, all she has to do is to do the same as that Jewish man did, who 
    later became Muslim; she can add and take away things from these three books 
    and see what happens as a result. 

    But we do not tell her to show her copy of the Qur’aan to a 
    scribe, rather we tell her to show it to Muslim children, and they will tell 
    her where the mistakes are in her copy! 

    Some Muslim states have printed Mus-hafs in which there were 
    mistakes, and young children found them before the grown-ups did!

The evidence (daleel) for this is to be found in the Ahaadeeth and Aathaar (reports). Among the Ahaadeeth is the Hadeeth of Abu Bakrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) heard any news that made him glad, he would fall down prostrating to Allah, may He be exalted.
(Reported by the five except al-Nisaa’i; al-Tirmidhi said, it is hasan ghareeb). According to the version narrated by Ahmad: he saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), when news reached him that his troops had prevailed over their enemy, he was lying with his head in ‘Aa’ishah’s lap, then he got up and fell in prostration. (Reported by Ahmad, 5/45; al-Haakim, 4/291).
Another hadeeth is that narrated by ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Awf, who said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went out to the place where the sadaqah (charitable donations) was kept, then he faced the Qiblah and fell in prostration, remaining like that for a long time. Then he raised his head and said, “Jibreel came to me with good news, he said, ‘Allah says to you, “Whoever sends blessings on you, I will send blessings on him, and whoever sends greetings of peace to you, I will send greetings of peace to him,”’ so I prostrated in thankfulness to Allah.”
(Narrated by Ahmad. Al-Mundhiri said: the hadeeth of Sajdat al-Shukr came from the hadeeth of al-Baraa’ with a saheeh isnaad, and from the hadeeth of Ka’b ibn Maalik and others.)
The reports include the following:


Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) prostrated when he heard the news that Musaylimah had been killed.


(Reported by Sa’eed ibn Mansoor in his Sunan).
‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib prostrated when he found Dhu’l-Thadiyah among the Khawaarij.
(Reported by Ahmad in al-Musnad)
Ka’b ibn Maalik prostrated at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he was given the glad tidings that Allah had accepted his repentance.
(The story is agreed upon)

Why is your Du`a not answered?


How does Allah answer our Du`a?","Praise be to Allah.The power of Du`a
Imam Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“Du`a and ta`awwudhat [prayers seeking refuge with Allah] are like a weapon, and a weapon is only as good as the person who is using it; it is not merely the matter of how sharp it is. If the weapon is perfect and free of faults, and the arm of the person using it is strong, and there is nothing stopping him, then he can lay waste the enemy. But if any of these three features is lacking, then the effect will be lacking accordingly.” (Ad-Da’ wad-Dawa’, p. 35)
From this statement, it will be clear that there is an etiquette and rulings which must be fulfilled, in the Du`a and in the person making the Du`a. 
Conditions of dua
There are also things that may prevent the Du`a from reaching Allah or being answered . These things must be removed from the person making the Du`a and from the Du`a. When all of these conditions are fulfilled , then the Du`a may be answered.

Sincerity in making Du`a. This is the most important condition. Allah has commanded us to be sincere when making Du`a, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):

So, call you (O Muhammad and the believers) upon (or invoke) Allah making (your) worship pure for Him (Alone) (by worshipping none but Him and by doing religious deeds sincerely for Allah’s sake only and not to show off and not to set up rivals with Him in worship.) [Ghafir 40:14]
Sincerity in Du`a means having the firm belief that the One upon Whom you are calling Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted is alone able to meet your need, and it also means avoiding any kind of showing off in your Du`a.

Repentance and turning back to Allah. Sin is one of the main reasons why Du`as are not answered, so the person who is making Du`a should hasten to repent and seek forgiveness before he makes Du`a. Allah tells us that Nuh (peace be upon him) said:

I said (to them): Ask forgiveness from your Lord, verily, He is Oft-Forgiving; He will send rain to you in abundance, And give you increase in wealth and children, and bestow on you gardens and bestow on you rivers. [Nuh 71:10-12]

Beseeching, humbling oneself, hoping for Allah's reward and fearing His punishment. This is the spirit, essence and purpose of Du`a. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret. He likes not the aggressors [Al-`Araf 7:55]
Urgently beseeching and repeating the Du`a, without getting exasperated or bored; this is achieved by repeating the Du`a two or three times. Restricting it to three times is preferable, in accordance with the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) liked to say a Du`a three times and ask for forgiveness three times. (Narrated by Abu Dawud and An-Nasa’i)
Making Du`a at times of ease, and saying more Du`as at times of plenty. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Remember Allah during times of ease and He will remember you during times of hardship. (Narrated by Ahmad)
Seeking to draw closer to Allah by calling upon Him by His Most Beautiful Names and Sublime Attributes at the beginning of the Du`a or at the end. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah, so call on Him by them [Al-A'raf 7:180].
Choosing the clearest and most concise words and the best of Du`as. The best of Du`as are the Du`as of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but it is permissible to say other words according to the specific needs of a person.

Other aspects of the etiquette of making Du`a, although they are not obligatory, are: to face the Qiblah; to make Du`a in a state of purity; to start the Du`a with praise of Allah and blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It is also prescribed to raise the hands when making Du`a.
One of the things that helps to bring a response to Du`a is to seek the best times and places .
Among the best times is the time just before Fajr (dawn), the last third of the night , the last hour of Jumu`ah (Friday), when rain is falling , and between the Adhan and Iqamah .
Among the best places are mosques in general, and Al-Masjid Al-Haram [in Makkah] in particular.
Among the situations in which Du`a is more likely to be answered are: when one is mistreated or oppressed, when one is travelling, when one is fasting, when one is in desperate need, and when a Muslim makes Du`a for his brother in his absence.
Why is your Du`a not answered?
Things which may prevent Du`a from being answered include:

When the Du`a is weak in itself, because it involves something inappropriate, or involves bad manners towards Allah, may He be Exalted, or it is inappropriate, which means asking Allah for something which it is not permitted to ask, e.g. when a man asks to live forever in this world, or he asks for a sin or something prohibited, or he prays that he will die, and so on. 

Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: A person's Du`as will continue to be answered so long as he does not pray for something sinful or for the breaking of family ties. (Narrated by Muslim)

When the person who is making Du`a is weak in himself, because he is faint-hearted in his turning towards Allah. This may be either because of bad manners towards Allah, may He be Exalted such as raising his voice in Du`a or making Du`a in the manner of one who thinks he has no need of Allah; or because he pays too much attention to the wording and tries to come up with unnecessarily ornate phrases, without paying attention to the meaning; or because he tries too hard to weep or shout without really feeling it, or he goes to extremes in that.
The reason why his Du`a is not answered may be because he has done something that Allah has forbidden , such as having prohibited wealth whether it be food or drink or clothing or accommodation or transportation, or he has taken a prohibited job, or the stain of sin is still in his heart, or he is following Bid`ah (innovation) in religion, or his heart has been overtaken by negligence.
Consuming prohibited wealth is one of the major reasons why Du`as are not answered.

Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: O people, Allah is Good and only accepts that which is good. Allah commanded the pious to follow the same commandments as He gave to the Messengers. He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O (you) Messengers! Eat of the Tayyibat [all kinds of lawful foods which Allah has made lawful] and do righteous deeds. Verily, I am Well-Acquainted with what you do.” [Al-Mu’minun 23:51]
“O you who believe (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism)! Eat of the lawful things that We have provided you with.” [Al-Baqarah 2:172]
Then he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) mentioned a man who has travelled on a long journey and is dishevelled and covered with dust; he stretches forth his hands to the heaven, (saying) O Lord, O Lord, but his food is prohibited, his drink is prohibited, all his nourishment is prohibited, so how can his Du`a be accepted? (Narrated by Muslim)
The man described by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had some of the characteristics which help Du`as to be answered, he was travelling and he was in need of Allah, may He be Exalted and Glorified but the fact that he consumed prohibited wealth prevented his Du`a from being answered. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound.

Trying to hasten the response. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The Du`a of any one of you will be answered so long as he is not impatient and says, I made Du`a but it was not answered. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)
Making the Du`a conditional, such as saying, O Allah, forgive me if You will or O Allah, have mercy upon me if You will. The person who makes Du`a has to be resolute in his supplication, striving hard and earnestly repeating his Du`a. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Let not any one of you say, O Allah, forgive me if You will, O Allah, have mercy on me if You will. Let him be resolute in the matter, whilst knowing that no one can compel Allah to do anything. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)

In order for Du`as to be answered, it is not essential to adhere to all of these points and be free of all that could prevent one's Du`a from being answered. That is something which happens very rarely. But one has to try hard and strive towards achieving this.
How does Allah answer our Du`a?
Another important point is to realise that the response to the Du`a may take different forms:

either Allah will respond and fulfil the desire of the person who made the Du`a, or He will ward off some evil from him because of the Du`a, 
or He will facilitate for him something better than what he asked for, 
or He will save it with Him for him on the Day of Resurrection when he will be most in need of it.

5123,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5123,Defining the    extent of the pubic hair (al-‘aanah),"As Muslims we are required to shave pubic hair.
For a man, is this all the hair between his navel and his knees ? (i.e. all hair on the lower abdomen and thighs)",,,"Praise be to Allah.Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath (10/343):
Al-Nawawi said: what is meant by al-‘aanah is the hair which is above and around the man’s penis, and the hair around the woman’s vagina. It was reported from Abu’l-‘Abbaas ibn Surayj that it is the hair that grows around the back passage. From all of this, we may understand that it is mustahabb to shave all the hair from the front and back and all around them. Shaving is mentioned because this is the most common method, but it is also permissible to remove hair by waxing, plucking, etc.
Abu Shaamah said: al-‘aanah is the hair that grows on the rakab, which is what is underneath the bulge of the abdomen and above the private parts. Or it was said that it is the exterior of the private parts; or the private part itself, whether of a man or a woman. It is mustahabb to remove the hair from the front and back, indeed it is more important to remove the hair from the back, lest any faeces get stuck to it and cannot be removed by cleaning it with water or with stones, tissues, etc. Depilatory agents (waxing, sugaring, etc.) may be used instead of shaving, or the hair may be plucked or cut. Ahmad was asked about removing the pubic hair with scissors. He said, “I hope this will be good enough.” He was asked, “What about plucking?” He said, “Could anyone do that?” Ibn Daqeeq al-‘Eed said: the scholars of the Arabic language said: “al-‘aanah is the hair that grows around the private part, or it was said that it is where the hair grows. This is what was meant in the report. Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi said: The pubic hair is the body hair which it is most important to remove, because it grows thick and dirt gets trapped in it. Ibn Daqeeq al-‘Eed said: it is as if those who said it is mustahabb to shave the hair around the back passage mentioned this by way of analogy.

There are fifteen places in the Quran where we should perform sajdat al-tilawah (prostration of recitation) when reciting them. 
‘Amr ibn al-’As narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited to him fifteen verses in the Quran where one should prostrate, three of which are in al-Mufassal and two in Surat al-Hajj. It was reported by Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah, al-Hakim and al-Daraqutni, and classed as hasan by al-Mundhiri and al-Nawawi. 
Verses of sujud al-tilawah
The fifteen verses of sujud al-tilawah are:

Surely those who are with your Lord (angels) are never too proud to perform acts of worship to Him, but they glorify His Praise and prostrate before Him. [al-A'raf 7:206]
And unto Allah (Alone) falls in prostration whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and so do their shadows in the mornings and in the afternoons. [al-Ra’d 13:15]
And to Allah prostrate all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, of the live moving creatures and the angels, and they are not proud [i.e., they worship their Lord (Allah) with humility]. [al-Nahl 16:49]
Say (O Muhammad): Believe in it (the Quran) or do not believe (in it). Verily! Those who were given knowledge before it, when it is recited to them, fall down on their faces in humble prostration. [al-Isra 17:107-109]
When the Verses of the Most Beneficent (Allah) were recited unto them, they fell down prostrating and weeping. [Maryam 19:58]
See you not that to Allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and al-dawab (moving living creatures, beasts, etc.), and many of mankind? But there are many (men) on whom the punishment is justified. And whomsoever Allah disgraces, none can honour him. Verily! Allah does what He wills. [al-Hajj 22:18]
O you who believe! Bow down, and prostrate yourselves, and worship your Lord and do good that you may be successful. [al-Hajj 22:77]
And when it is said to them: Prostrate to the Most Beneficent (Allah)! They say, And what is the Most Beneficent? Shall we fall down in prostration to that which you (O Muhammad) command us? And it increases in them only aversion. [al-Furqan 25:60]
[As Shaytan has barred them from Allah's Way] so that they do not worship (prostrate before) Allah, Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you conceal and what you reveal. [al-Naml 27:25, 26]
Only those believe in Our ayat (verses, signs, etc.) who, when they are reminded of them, fall down prostrate, and glorify the Praises of their Lord, and they are not proud. [al-Sajdah 32:15]
And Dawud guessed that We had tried him and he sought forgiveness of his Lord, and he fell down prostrate and turned (to Allah) in repentance. [Sad 38:24]
And from among His Signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Prostrate not to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate to Him Who created them, if you (really) worship Him. [Fussilat 41:37, 38]
So fall down in prostration to Allah, and worship Him (Alone). [al-Najm 53:62]
And when the Quran is recited to them, they fall not prostrate. [al-Inshiqaq 84:21]
Fall prostrate and draw near to Allah! [al-’Alaq 96:19] (See Fiqh al-Sunnah by Sheikh Sayyid Sabiq, 186-188)

Scholarly views of the narration of ‘Amr ibn Al-’As about sujud al-tilawah
Al-Albani said, in Tamam al-Minnah (296):
On the contrary, the hadith is not hasan, because it includes two majhul [unknown] narrators. Al-Hafiz said in al-Talkhis, after quoting the opinion of al-Mundhiri and al-Nawawi that it is hasan: ‘Abd al-Haqq and Ibn Qattan classed it as da’if [weak]. It includes ‘Abd-Allah ibn Munayn, who is majhul, and the one who narrated from him is al-Harith ibn Sa’id al-Atqi, who is also unknown. Ibn Makula said: He did not narrate any hadith apart from this one.”
Hence al-Tahawi was of the opinion that there is no second sajdah in Surat al-Hajj, towards the end of the surah. This is also the opinion of Ibn Hazm who said in al-Muhalla:
“Because it is not narrated in any sahih report that this was the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and there is no scholarly consensus to this effect. But it was reported with a sahih isnad that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab, his son ‘Abd-Allah and Abu Darda performed sajdah in (the second verse quoted from Surat al-Hajj).”
Then Ibn Hazm discussed whether the sajdahs for the other verses quoted are prescribed in Islam. He mentioned that the scholars are agreed upon the first ten, that performing sujud when reciting these verses is prescribed.
 Al-Tahawi also reported this consensus in Sharh al-Ma’ani (1/211), but he said that the sajdah in Surat Fussilat was prescribed, instead of the sajdah in Surat Sad. 
Both scholars narrated ahadith with sahih isnads from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning the sajdahs in Sad, al-Najm, al-Inshiqaq and al-’Alaq. These last three are from the Mufassal, which is referred to in the hadith of ‘Amr mentioned above.
In conclusion, even though the isnad of the hadith is weak, it is supported by the consensus of the ummah which supports most of it, and by sahih ahadith which support the rest of it, except for the second sajdah in Suat al-Hajj, for which there is no evidence in the Sunnah or in the consensus of the scholars. But some of the Sahabah used to prostrate when reciting it, which could be taken as evidence, especially since no one is known to have disputed with them in this regard.
To sum up, the prostration of recitation should be performed when reciting the fifteen verses quoted above.

5142,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5142,"The revelation of the Quran in seven styles (ahruf, sing. harf)","I have read that during the third Khalief, Oethmaan, a committee under supervision of Zaid ibn Thabit has been ordered to make an official editorship of the whole Koran. But this ""Oethmanian"" text didn't give yet a uniform reading.
Because early arabic language didn't have vowels and also some consonants had the same or almost the same form. New signs were introduced to seperate the different letters. But this still did not stop the different ways of reading.
In the first half of the fourth/tenth century the 'imaam of the Koran readers' in Baghdad, Ibn Moedjahid, gave a solution to this problem. He said that the word harf should be put equivalent to kira'a. He declared seven ways of reading correct. Because according to him the saying of the Prophet (PBUH) that the Koran was send in seven ahroef means that seven ways of reading are inspired.
Nowadays only to ways of reading are in use, Warsj of Nafi' and Hafs of 'Asim.
Could you tell me more about these different ways of reading? Are there ahadieth about this?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly :
you should note, may Allah bless you, that the Quran was revealed in one style at the beginning, but the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) kept asking Jibreel until he taught him seven styles, all of which were complete. The evidence for that is the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas who narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibreel taught me one style and I reviewed it until he taught me more, and I kept asking him for more and he gave me more until finally there were seven styles.”
(narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3047; Muslim, 819) 
Secondly, what is meant by styles (ahruf, sing. harf)? 
The best of the scholarly opinions concerning what is meant is that there are seven ways of reciting the Quran, where the wording may differ but the meaning is the same; if there is a different meaning then it is by way of variations on a theme, not opposing and contradiction. 
Thirdly: 
Some of the scholars said that what was meant by ahruf was the dialects of the Arabs, but this is far-fetched, because of the hadeeth of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab who said: “I heard Hishaam ibn Hakeem reciting Soorat al-Furqaan in a manner different from that in which I used to recite it and the way in which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught me to recite it.  I was about to argue with him whilst he was praying, but I waited until he finished his prayer, and then I tied his garment around his neck and seized him by it and brought him to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, I heard this man reciting Soorat-al-Furqaan in a way different to the way you taught it to me.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him, ‘Recite it,’ and he recited it as I had heard him recite it. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘It was revealed like this.’ Then he said to me, ‘Recite it,’ so I recited it and he said, ‘It was revealed like this.’ This Qur'aan has been revealed in seven different ways, so recite it in the way that is easiest for you.’”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2287; Muslim, 818) 
It is known that Hishaam was Asadi Qurashi (i.e., from the clan of Bani Asad in Quraysh) and ‘Umar was ‘Adawi Qurashi (i.e., from the clan of Bani ‘Adiyy in Quraysh). Both of them were from Quraysh and Quraysh had only one dialect. If the difference in ahruf (styles) had been a difference in dialects, why would two men of Quraysh have been different? 
The scholars mentioned nearly forty different opinions concerning this matter! Perhaps the most correct is that which we have mentioned above. And Allah knows best. 
Fourthly: 
It seems that the seven styles were revealed with different wordings, as indicated by the hadeeth of ‘Umar, because ‘Umar’s objection was to the style, not the meaning. The differences between these styles are not the matter of contradiction and opposition, rather they are synonymous, as Ibn Mas’ood said: “It is like one of you saying halumma, aqbil or ta’aal (all different ways of saying ‘Come here’).” 
Fifthly: 
With regard to the seven recitations (al-qiraa’aat al-saba’), this number is not based on the Quran and Sunnah, rather it is the ijtihaad of Ibn Mujaahid (may Allah have mercy on him). People thought that al-ahruf al-saba’ (the seven styles) were al-qiraa’aat al-saba’ (the seven recitations) because they happened to be the same number. But this number may have come about coincidentally, or it may have been done deliberately by Ibn Mujaahid to match what was narrated about the number of styles (ahruf) being seven. Some people thought that the styles (ahruf) were the recitations, but this is a mistake. No such comment is known among the scholars. The seven recitations are one of the seven styles, and this is the style that ‘Uthmaan chose for all the Muslims.  
Sixthly: 
When ‘Uthmaan made copies of the Quran, he did so according to one style (harf), but he omitted the dots and vowel points so that some other styles could also be accommodated.  So the Mus-haf that was copied in his time could be read according to other styles, and whatever styles were accommodated by the Mus-haf of ‘Uthmaan remained in use, and the styles that could not be accommodated fell into disuse. The people had started to criticize one another for reciting differently, so ‘Uthmaan united them by giving them one style of the Quran. 
Seventhly: 
Your saying that Mujaahid’s different recitations meant the seven styles (ahruf) is not correct, as was said by Shaykh al-Islam ibn Taymiyyah. (Majmoo’ah al-Fatawa, vol. 13, p. 210) 
Eighthly: 
The seven readers or reciters were: 
1-Naafi’ al-Madani
2-Ibn Katheer al-Makki
3-‘Aasim al-Kufi
4-Hamzah al-Zayaat al-Kufi
5-Al-Kisaa’i al-Kufi
6-Abu ‘Amr ibn al-‘Ala’ al-Basri
7-‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Aamir al-Shaami
The ones who have the strongest isnaad in recitation are Naafi’ and ‘Aasim. 
The most eloquent are Abu ‘Amr and al-Kisaa’i.

    prisoners in Islam","i have a project in the quality of health
      care in the prison.. do the prisoners have the same health care like other people.. what
      is the isalmic prespective of justic and equality in this case??",,,"Praise be to Allah.Islam pays great attention to the matter of prisons and
    the circumstances of prisoners; it is rare to find anything similar to this in any place
    or time. The fuqahaa’ discussed in their books the rulings pertaining to prisoners,
    their circumstances and how they should be treated. This concern stems from the Islamic
    concern for the protection of man and respect for his humanity.
To make the matter easier to understand and to make the rulings more
    clear, the scholars divided the subject-matter into two parts: the rulings pertaining to
    the personal health of prisoners, and the rulings pertaining to health care in the place
    that is used as a prison.
One: Rulings pertaining to the personal health of prisoners
Imprisoning a sick person. The fuqahaa’ discussed the matter of
        imprisoning a person who is sick in the first place – do the authorities have the
        right to imprison a sick person? The answer is that this is the matter of ijtihaad, and
        the final decision rests with the Qaadi (judge) who must weigh up the reason why this
        person is to be imprisoned, the seriousness of his disease and the possibility of taking
        care of him in jail. If sufficient health care is available for this sick person in
        prison, and he is not suffering a serious illness which could kill him if he is detained,
        it is permissible to imprison him. If such care is not available, the judge may hand him
        over to someone who can treat him and guard him, without releasing him completely, until
        it is possible to imprison him again.

If a prisoner becomes sick whilst in jail. If a prisoner becomes sick
        whilst in jail and it is possible to treat him there, then he must be treated without
        bringing him out. Doctors and servants should not be prevented from going in to see him,
        treat him and serve him. If not treating him leads to his death, criminal charges are to
        be laid against those who were the cause of that, and they are to be punished. The Prophet
        (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) passed by a prisoner who was in chains, and he
        called out, “O Muhammad, O Muhammad!” He came to him and said, “What is the
        matter?” He said, “I am hungry – feed me. I am thirsty – give me
        water.” The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded that his
        needs should be met. (Narrated by Muslim, 3/1263). And no doubt
        medical treatment is what the sick person needs.
      
      But if it is not possible to treat him inside the prison, he must be
      taken out to a place where it is possible to treat him, under the supervision of the jail
      or whoever is delegated to the task of watching and guarding him.
With regard to these rulings, the fuqahaa do not differentiate between
      physical illness and psychological illness (true psychological illness, that is, as
      opposed to the made-up psychological illness or the regular psychological illness which
      many lawyers use as a means of getting criminals let off). Hence the fuqahaa’ (may
      Allaah have mercy on them) stated that it is not permissible to lock the door on the
      prisoner – so long as there is the certainty that he will not run away – or to
      put him in a darkened room, or to harm him in any way or to do anything that will make him
      terrified. His relatives should not be prevented from visiting him, because this will have
      an effect on his health and psychology.
It is prescribed for the authorities or their representative to set up a
        special medical wing in the prison, to take care of the prisoners’ health needs. This
        will spare them the need to take them out to public hospitals and expose them to possible
        insult and humiliation.
Prisoners should be allowed to see their wives and to have intimate
        relations with them, if there is a suitable place for that in the jail, as a protection
        for them and their wives.
The fuqahaa’ stated that it is obligatory to enable prisoners to do
        wudoo’ and purify themselves, which is undoubtedly an important protective precaution
        against sickness.
Two: Rulings pertaining to health care in the place that is used as a
    prison
The place that is used as a prison should be spacious, clean,
    well-ventilated, lit by natural sunlight, and furnished with the necessary facilities such
    as washrooms, etc.
It is not permissible to gather such a large number of prisoners in one
    place that they will not be able to do wudoo’ and pray.
Three: there follow some of the things which the fuqahaa’ stated
    it is haraam to use when disciplining or dealing with prisoners:
Mutilating the body: it is not permitted to punish a prisoner by cutting
        off any part of his body or breaking any of his bones. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings
        of Allaah be upon him) forbade mutilation of prisoners-of-war and said: “Do not
        mutilate.” (Narrated by Muslim, 3/1357).
      
      
      Hitting the face, etc., because of the humiliation involved. By the same
        token, it is not permitted to put chains on prisoners’ necks or to lay them on the
        ground to whip them, even if this is the hadd (Islamic punishment) prescribed for them,
        because this involves humiliation and harms their health and bodies.
Punishment by fire, strangulation or holding a prisoner’s head
        under water – except in cases of qasaas and where the punishment needs to fit
        the crime. For example, if a person has committed aggression against another by burning
        him, it is permissible to exact retribution against him in the same manner.
Starving prisoners or exposing them to the cold, or feeding them harmful
        things, or preventing them from wearing clothes. If a prisoner dies because of such
        things, his jailer may be executed in retribution (qasaas) or be required to pay
        diyah (blood money).
Removing prisoners’ clothing, because this uncovers their
        ‘awrah and exposes them to physical and psychological illness.
Preventing them from relieving themselves, doing wudoo’ and
        praying. It is obvious that this is harmful to the prisoners’ health.
Examples of Muslims’ concern for prisoners:
The hadeeth mentioned above shows how the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings
    of Allaah be upon him) issued commands that prisoners should be cared for and their needs
    for food and drink met. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) often
    used to hand prisoners over to his companions and urge them to treat them well.
The Rightly-Guided Khaleefah ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be
    pleased with him) used to inspect the prisons, meet the prisoners in them and enquire
    about their circumstances.
‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez, the fifth Rightly-Guided
    Khaleefah, used to write to his employees, telling them to see how the prisoners were and
    to take care of the sick among them.
The ‘Abbaasi khaleefah al-Mu’tadid allocated 1500 dinars of
    the monthly budget to be spent on the needs and medical treatment of prisoners.
When the ‘Abbaasi khaleefah al-Muqtadir imprisoned one of his
    wazeers, Ibn Muqlah, the wazeer got sick. So the khaleefah sent the famous doctor Thaabit
    ibn Sinaan ibn Thaabit ibn Qurrah to treat him in jail, and he urged him to treat him
    well. The doctor used to feed him with his own hand and treated him very kindly.
At the time of the khaleefah al-Muqtadir, the wazeer ‘Ali ibn
    ‘Eesaa al-Jarraah wrote to the head of the hospitals of Iraq at that time, telling
    him: “I have been thinking, may Allaah grant you long life, about those who are in
    prison. With their large numbers and rough accommodation, they are not free from disease.
    They are prevented from doing things which will benefit them and meeting with doctors whom
    they can consult about the sicknesses they are exposed to. So you have to appoint doctors
    for them who will go in and see them every day and take them medicine and drinks, and who
    will go around to all the jails and treat the sick in them and prescribe medicine for
    them.” This care lasted throughout the khilaafah of al-Muqtadir, al-Qaahir, al-Raadi
    and al-Muttaqi.

5163,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5163,Does ‘iddah apply in the case of khula’?,does iddah imply when it is the woman who is seeking the divorce (khuli).,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    1 – Khula’ – in principle – can only occur at the request of 
    the wife, and with the husband’s subsequent agreement to end the marriage. 

    2 – ‘Iddah is obligatory upon every woman who leaves her 
    husband, or whose husband leaves her, whether the cause is talaaq (divorce), 
    annulment of the marriage or the death of the husband, except when the 
    divorce occurs before the marriage has been consummated, in which case the 
    woman does not have to observe ‘iddah, because Allaah says (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! When 
    you marry believing women, and then divorce them before you have sexual 
    intercourse with them, no ‘Iddah [divorce prescribed period] have you to 
    count in respect of them”[al-Ahzaab 33:49] 

    3 – With regard to the ‘iddah following khula’, the correct 
    scholarly view is that it is one menstrual cycle, as is indicated by the 
    Sunnah. 

    It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that the wife of Thaabit ibn 
    Qays ended her marriage to her husband by means of khula’ at the time of the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded her to observe an 
    ‘iddah of one menstrual cycle. (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1185; Abu Dawood, 
    2229. Also narrated by al-Nasaa’i (3497) from the hadeeth of al-Rabee’ bint 
    ‘Afra’. The two hadeeth were both classed as saheeh by Ibn al-Qayyim, as we 
    shall see below). 

    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    In the fact that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) commanded the woman who ended her marriage to her 
    husband by khula’ to observe an ‘iddah of one menstrual cycle, there is 
    evidence for two rulings: 

    The first is that she does not have to wait for three 
    menstrual cycles, rather one menstrual cycle is sufficient. Just as this is 
    clearly the Sunnah, it was also the view of Ameer al-Mu’mineen ‘Uthmaan ibn 
    ‘Affaan, ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, al-Rabee’ bint Mu’awwadh and 
    her paternal uncle, who was one of the greatest Sahaabah. We do not know of 
    anyone who held a different opinion, as al-Layth ibn Sa’d narrated that 
    Naafi’ the freed slave of Ibn ‘Umar heard al-Rabee’ bint Mu’awwadh ibn 
    ‘Afra’ telling  ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) that 
    she had ended her marriage to her husband by khula’ at the time of ‘Uthmaan 
    ibn ‘Affaan, and her paternal uncle had come to ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan and 
    said, The daughter of Mu’awwadh ended her marriage to her husband by khula’ 
    today, so should she move (from the marital home)?  ‘Uthmaan said, She 
    should move, and there is no inheritance between them, and she does not have 
    to observe any ‘iddah, but she should not remarry until one menstrual cycle 
    has passed, lest she be pregnant. ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar said: and ‘Uthmaan 
    was the best of us and the most knowledgeable. 

    This view was also shared by Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh and Imaam 
    Ahmad, according to one report narrated from him. It was also the view 
    favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah. 

    Those who supported this view said: this is in accordance 
    with the principles of sharee’ah. The ‘iddah (in the case of talaaq) was 
    made three menstrual cycles in order to lengthen the time during which the 
    husband may take back his wife, so that the husband will have enough time to 
    rethink the matter and to be able to take his wife back during this time. 
    But in the case of khula’ the wife is not going to go back and the purpose 
    is simply to establish whether she is pregnant or not, so one menstrual 
    cycle is sufficient. They said: this does not contradict the ruling that the 
    ‘iddah for a woman divorced by talaaq is three months. In the case of 
    divorce the ‘iddah is the same whether it is a final talaaq or a revocable 
    talaaq.

     Zaad al-Ma’aad, 5/196, 197

     Some scholars said that the ‘iddah for a woman who ends her 
    marriage to her husband by khula’ is three menstrual cycles, as in the case 
    of one who is divorced by talaaq, but this was expertly refuted by Imam Ibn 
    al-Qayyim, who said:

     What indicates that khula’ is not the same as talaaq is the 
    fact that in the case of a revocable talaaq after consummation of the 
    marriage, there are specific rulings which are not applicable in the case of 
    khula’.

    1.That the husband has more right 
    to take her back.

    2.When the husband issues a 
    talaaq, is it counted as one of three, and after the third it is not 
    permissible for the wife to go back to him until she has been married to 
    another man and that marriage has been consummated.

    3.‘Iddah in the case of talaaq is 
    three menstrual cycles.

     So the ‘iddah in the case of khula’ is what is indicated by 
    the Sunnah, namely one menstrual cycle.

Does Allah forgive homosexual acts?


Can homosexuals get married?","Praise be to Allah.Homosexuality in Islam
Undoubtedly the sin of homosexuality is one of the worst sins ; indeed, it is one of the major sins that Allah has forbidden. Allah destroyed the people of Lut (peace be upon him) with the most terrifying kinds of punishment because they persisted in their sin and made this evil action commonplace and acceptable among themselves. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“So when Our Commandment came, We turned (the towns of Sodom in Palestine) upside down, and rained on them stones of baked clay, in a well-arranged manner one after another; Marked from your Lord.” [Hud 11:82-83]
Then Allah says, warning those who come after them of the nations who do the same deed as they did (interpretation of the meaning):
“and they are not ever far from the Zalimun (polytheists, evildoers).” [Hud 11:83]
And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And they indeed sought to shame his guest (by asking to commit sodomy with them). So We blinded their eyes (saying), `Then taste you My Torment and My Warnings.’” [Al-Qamar 54:37]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever you find doing the action of the people of Lut, kill them, the one who does it and the one two whom it is done.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 2727; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami` As-Saghir wa Ziyadatihi, 6589)
Imam Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“It was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Kill the one who does it and the one to whom it is done.” (Narrated by the four authors of Sunan. Its chain of narration is authentic. At-Tirmidhi said it is a sound Hadith)
Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) judged in accordance with this, and he wrote instructions to this effect to Khalid (may Allah be pleased with him), after consulting with the Companions. `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) was the strictest of them with regard to that. Ibn Al-Qasar and our Shaykh said: the Companions agreed that [the person who does homosexual acts] should be killed, but they differed as to how he should be killed. Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) said that he should be thrown down from a cliff. `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said that a wall should be made to collapse on him. Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said, they should be killed by stoning. 
This shows that there was consensus among them that [the person who does homosexual acts ] should be killed, but they differed as to how he should be executed. This is similar to the ruling of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning the person who has intercourse with a woman who is his Mahram [incest], because in both cases intercourse is not permitted under any circumstances. Hence the connection was made in the Hadith of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) who reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Whoever you find doing the deed of the people of Lut, kill them.” And it was also reported that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever has intercourse with a woman who is his Mahram, kill him.” And according to another Hadith with the same Isnad (chain of narration), “Whoever has intercourse with an animal, kill him and kill the animal with him.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 2420; Abu Dawud, 4464; At-Tirmidhi, 1454; Al-Hakim, 4/355)
This ruling is in accordance with the ruling of Shari`ah, because the worse the forbidden action is, the more severe the punishment for it. Having intercourse in a manner that is not permissible under any circumstances is worse than having intercourse in a manner which may be permitted in some circumstances, so its punishment is more severe. This was stated by Ahmad in one of the two reports narrated from him.” (Zad Al-Ma`ad, part 5, pp. 40-41)
Lesbianism in Islam
The same applies to the sin of lesbianism . There is no doubt among the jurists that lesbianism is prohibited and is a major sin, as stated by Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him). (Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, part 24, p. 251)
Punishment for homosexuality in Islam
With regard to the specific type of punishment mentioned in the question – stoning to death – this kind of punishment is for the adulterer who is married. The Shar`i punishment for the crime of homosexuality is execution – by the sword, according to the most correct view – as was narrated in the discussion above about the differences among the scholars as to how this execution should be carried out. 
Punishment for lesbianism in Islam
As far as lesbianism is concerned, there is no prescribed punishment for it, but it is subject to Ta`zir [unspecified punishment to be determined at the discretion of the judge]. (Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, part 24, p. 253)
Does Allah forgive homosexual acts?
But if the person who does this evil deed, or any other action which is subject to a prescribed punishment, repents, gives up that sin, seeks forgiveness, regrets what he has done and intends never to go back to it – Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about that, and he answered:
If a homosexual truly repents to Allah , Allah will accept his repentance, and he does not need to confess his sin to anyone so that the prescribed punishment would be carried out on him. (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, part 34, p. 180)
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And those who do not invoke1 with Allāh another deity or kill the soul which Allāh has forbidden [to be killed], except by right, and do not commit unlawful sexual intercourse. And whoever should do that will receive a penalty. The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace; Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And whosoever repents and does righteous good deeds; then verily, he repents towards Allah with true repentance.” [Al-Furqaan 25:69-71]
Can homosexuals get married?
If a homosexual repents sincerely towards Allah, there is no reason why he should not get married , and indeed it may be obligatory in his case, as a protection for him and in accordance with what Allah has permitted.

    birth control pills at first in case the marriage fails","Is it permissable for a woman to go
      on the pill (female contraception) prior to her marriage, so as to avoid pregnancy in case
      the marriage does not work out (ie. she becomes pregnant and then they divorce and she is
      left with the child)? Should she inform her spouse on the wedding night or prior to the
      nikkah that she is on the pill? In light of the above, is it permissible to use
      contraceptives to avoid pregnancy in the event that the marriage might not work out (ie
      for the first year of the marriage)?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If it is medically proven that birth control pills are
    harmful to women, then it is not permissible to use them either before marriage or
    afterwards, on the basis of the rule that no harm should be done. This rule is based on
    the aayaat (interpretation of the meanings):
“And do not kill yourselves” [al-Nisa’ 4:29]
“and do not throw yourselves into destruction” [al-Baqarah
    2:195]
Unless it is possible to produce pills that are free of harmful side
    effects, they should not be taken.
As for using any non-harmful means of contraception at the beginning of
    marriage, fearing that the marriage may not work out, there are a number of reservations
    about this, such as:
it may be a kind of pessimism, because you are expecting it to fail.

It may lead to an unhappy marital life and both spouses expecting bad of
        one another, because it is known that one of the most important purposes of marriage is to
        have children, and if this is delayed for a specific reason the relationship may cool off.
        If the husband finds out that this is what his wife is doing, it will spoil the
        relationship between them.

Pregnancy is one of the most important functions of women, which
        generates feelings of love and compassion towards her husband and children. If pregnancy
        is prevented the opposite feelings develop.

The fuqahaa’ (may Allaah have mercy on them) stipulated the
        condition for ‘azl (coitus interruptus) or other forms of contraception used by the
        woman, that it should only be done with the permission of the other spouse, because both
        of them have the right to have children. So it is not permissible for the wife to take
        birth control pills without her husband’s permission and consent.

The fear that the marriage may fail and the fact that there is a high
        divorce rate cannot be dealt with in this manner. The way to deal with it is to make the
        right choice of spouse and make sure that this is the right choice. The prospective
        husband should be allowed to see the prospective wife, because this is one of the ways of
        fostering love after marriage. Other means should also be used. We ask Allaah to guide us
        all. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
