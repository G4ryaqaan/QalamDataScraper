65702,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65702,She wants to pray tahajjud at the end of the night – should she pray Witr with the imam in Taraweeh?,"I'm a muslim woman who prays tarawehe. Mostly if I do not go for prayers, my younger brother does not go either.In the mosque where we pray from the imaam prays witr as well. I have been waking up to pray tahajud and read the Quran at night. After witr I can not pray Tahajud. What is a better option for me. To go for taraweh so my brother can go too or to stay home and pray at night? Which is more rewarding?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Your going to the mosque and attending Taraweeh with the 
    congregation and meeting your Muslim sisters are all good things, praise be 
    to Allaah. The fact that you are helping your brother to do this as well is 
    another good deed to be added to the others.  

    There is no conflict between this and your praying tahajjud 
    at the end of the night. You can combine all these good deeds, by doing one 
    of the two following things: 

    1 – Pray Witr with the imam, then when you can do tahajjud 
    after that, prayer whatever Allaah wills for you, two by two rak’ahs, 
    without repeating Witr, because one cannot pray two Witrs in one night. 

    2 – Delay Witr until the end of the night. When the imam says 
    the salaam at the end of Witr, do not say the salaam with him, rather stand 
    up and do an extra rak’ah, so that your Witr will then be at the end of the 
    night. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: 
    When some people pray Witr with the imam and the imam says the salaam, they 
    stand up and do another rak’ah so that their Witr will be at the end of the 
    night. What is the ruling on doing this?  Is it regarded as finishing the 
    prayer with the imam? 

    He replied: 

    We do not know of there being anything wrong with this. The 
    scholars stated that there is nothing wrong with doing that so that one will 
    pray Witr at the end of the night. It is still true that he has stood with 
    the imam until he finishes, because he stayed with him until the imam 
    finished, then he prayed an extra rak’ah for a legitimate shar’i purpose, so 
    that his Witr will be at the end of the night. There is nothing wrong with 
    that, and that does not mean that he did not stay with the imam, rather he 
    stayed with the imam until he finished, but then he did not finish with him, 
    rather he delayed a little. End quote. 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 
    11/312 

    Shaykh Ibn Jibreen (may Allaah preserve him) was asked a 
    similar question and he replied: 
It is better for the 
    person who is praying behind the imam to follow the imam until he finishes 
    Taraweeh and Witr, so that he will have stayed with the imam until he 
    finishes, and the reward for spending the whole night in prayer will be 
    recorded for him. This is what Imam Ahmad and other scholars did. 

    Based on this, if a person prays Witr with him (the imam) and 
    finishes with him, there is no need to do another Witr at the end of the 
    night. If he wakes up at the end of the night he may offer whatever prayers 
    Allaah has decreed for him, two rak'ahs at a time. And he should not repeat 
    Witr, because there should not be two Witrs in one night. 
Some scholars 
    regarded it as preferable to pray Witr with the imam and do an additional 
    rak’ah, by standing up after the imam says the salaam and then doing another 
    rak'ah and saying the salaam, and then praying Witr at the end of tahajjud, 
    because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “If any one of you fears that dawn is about to come, let him pray one rak’ah 
    as Witr …” And he said: “Make the last of your prayer at night Witr.” End 
    quote.

    second matter is good.

I will finish the school just few minutes before maghreb and will come home half an hour after this. If I will perform my salat at school, I will loose the transportation to home and be late from there. So what would be better for me to do?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Hastening to offer the prayer when the time for it begins is one of the best of deeds before Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. 
It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): Which deed is dearest to Allah? He said: “Prayer offered on time.” He said: Then what? He said: “Honouring one’s parents.” He said: Then what? He said: “Jihad for the sake of Allah.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (527) and Muslim (85). 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
This hadeeth encourages us to offer prayers regularly on time. It may be understood from it that it is mustahabb to offer them at the beginning of their time, because it is more on the safe side, and we should hasten to do them on time. End quote.  
Sharh Muslim, 2/265 
It was narrated that Umm Farwah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked: Which deed is best? He said: “Prayer offered at the beginning of its time.” Narrated by Abu Dawood (426); classed as saheeh by al-Albani. 
Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said:  
The beginning of its time is dearer to me except in the case of two prayers: ‘Isha’ and Zuhr, where one should wait until it has gotten cooler if it is hot.” End quote. 
Al-Mughni, 1/398 
It is also mustahabb to hasten to break the fast. A number of ahaadeeth have been narrated concerning that, such as that which was narrated by al-Bukhari (1957) and Muslim (1098) from Sahl ibn Sa’d (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The people will still be fine so long as they hasten to break the fast.” 
See the answer to question no. 50019 and 13999. 
Thus it is clear to you that it is mustahabb in your case to hasten to break the fast and pray Maghrib at school.  
But that is only what is recommended. If it is too difficult for you, and you fear that you will miss your ride or you will be late getting home, there is no sin on you if you delay the prayer and do it when you get home, so long as you think it most likely that you will get home before the adhaan of ‘Isha’. You could break your fast with a few dates that you carry with you on your way home. 
But if your question is about not fasting in Ramadaan because of hardship caused by work, we have discussed that in the answer to question no. 43772

What should we have done?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The sun and moon are two of the signs of Allah. By means of lunar and solar eclipses, Allah reminds His slaves of the Day of Resurrection, the Day on which their light will disappear. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So, when the sight shall be dazed.
8. And the moon will be eclipsed.
9. And the sun and moon will be joined together (by going one into the other or folded up or deprived of their light)” [al-Qiyaamah 75:7-9]
So by means of this sign Allah reminds us of that Day. See also question no. 5901. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) hastened to pray when that happened. 
When you saw the eclipse when you were going out for Fajr prayer, you had the choice of starting with the eclipse prayer, as suggested by some scholars, because of the command narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to hasten to do that. But if you started with Fajr first, this is also good because the obligatory prayer should come first. This may also serve an interest, especially since the eclipse could not be seen except at the time of the iqaamah, so it may have been too difficult for the people, especially those who had stayed up at night during the blessed month, if the imam had started with the eclipse prayer. So he started with Fajr prayer, to enable those who wanted to leave to do so, as that would be easier for the people; this is also less likely to cause confusion, especially for those who had come for Fajr and did not know that the imam was going to offer the eclipse prayer.",Islam Q&A

My question is: I bought some shares in the electrical company five months ago for 172 riyals per share. After I bought them, they went down to 147 riyals and have not yet gone back up to the purchase price. Is there any zakaah due on these shares? How should the zakaah be paid? Is it based on the purchase price or the current price which is 147?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    These shares are now regarded as trade goods, because trade 
    goods are anything that is prepared for sale. So zakaah is due on them. 

    The zakaah on trade goods is worked out on the basis of their 
    value at the end of the year, whether it is more than the purchase price or 
    less. 

    See question no. 65515 

    Based on this, if these shares reach the nisaab, or they 
    reach the nisaab when added to the cash money that you have, then you should 
    pay zakaah on them according to their value on the day when the year ends. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
The way in which zakaah 
    is paid on shares in companies is as follows: if the state undertakes the 
    mission of calculating and collecting the zakaah, then you have discharged 
    your responsibility, otherwise zakaah must be paid in the following manner: 
    they should be evaluated every year and one-quarter of one-tenth should be 
    paid, if the purpose of them is to trade. But if the purpose is investment, 
    then no zakaah is due on them, but zakaah is due on any profits they produce 
    if it is in the form of money and one year has passed. End quote.

    one who is keeping the money is not going through hardship or delay payment 
    unduly. End quote.

    9/354

    The Standing Committee was also asked about shares through 
    which one buys land and real estate. 

    They replied: 

    The shares mentioned in the question are a kind of trade 
    goods, so zakaah must be paid on them, to be evaluated every year according 
    to their current value, not the purchase price. If the owner has money he 
    may pay from that, otherwise he should pay the zakaah for past years from 
    their value after selling them and taking the money. End quote.

Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen 
    (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: Should zakaah on shares be based 
    on the official value of the share or on the market value, or what? 

    He replied: 

    Zakaah on shares and other trade goods should be based on the 
    market value. If it was worth one thousand at the time of purchase, then the 
    value rises to two thousand at the time when zakaah becomes due, then zakaah 
    should be based on the value of two thousand, because what matters is the 
    value of a thing when zakaah becomes due, not when it is bought. End quote. 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen,

It should be noted that 
    if trade goods are bought with gold or silver or cash (riyals, dollars or 
    other currencies), or with other goods, then the year for those goods starts 
    from the time when one acquired the wealth with which one bought them. Based 
    on this, the new year does not start from the time when one takes possession 
    of the new goods, rather it starts from the time when one acquired the

Additionally, he should repeat the prayer that he offered without purifying himself.","What happens if you deliberately pray without Wudu?


Does praying without Wudu take one out of Islam?","Praise be to Allah.What happens if you deliberately pray without Wudu?
It is well known and no Muslim has any excuse for not knowing that purification from impurity, whether minor or major, is obligatory and is a condition of prayer being valid. Whoever prays without purifying himself , whether deliberately or by mistake, his prayer is invalid and he has to repeat it; if it is done deliberately then he has committed a major sin. 
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The Muslim should not pray facing any direction other than the Qiblah, or without doing Wudu , bowing and prostrating. Whoever does that deserves to be rebuked and punished.” (Minhaj As-Sunnah An-Nabawiyyah, 5/204 )
There is a stern warning issued to one who does that. It was narrated from `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It was ordered that one of the slaves of Allah be flogged in his grave with one hundred lashes, but he kept asking until it was reduced to a single blow. So he was given a single blow, then his grave was filled with fire. When he came round, he said: `Why did you flog me?` It was said to him: `You offered one prayer without being in a state of purity , and you passed by one who was being wronged and did not help him.`” (Narrated by At-Tahawi in Mushkil Al-Athar, 4/231; classed as sound by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 2774) 
Does praying without Wudu take one out of Islam?
The scholars agreed that whoever prays without being in a state of purity because he believes that it is permissible or out of disrespect is a disbeliever. He should be asked to repent, and if he repents, all well and good, otherwise he should be executed. 
But if he prays without Wudu out of negligence, not because he thinks it is permissible or out of disrespect, Imam Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him) is of the view that this is also disbelief. However, the majority of scholars are of the view that he is not a disbeliever, rather he has committed a major sin. 
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:  
“If he knows that he is impure and that it is prohibited to pray when one is impure , then he has committed a grave sin, but he does not become a disbeliever thereby in our view, unless he regards that as permissible. But Abu Hanifah said: He has committed disbelief because of his disrespect. 
Our evidence is that it is a sin so it is akin to zina and the like.” (Al-Majmu` (2/84); Rawdat At-Talibin, 10/67)
(See the Hanafi view in Al-Bahr Ar-Ra`iq, 1/302, 151; 5/132; Hashiyat Ibn `Abidin, 3/719)

When can’t you swim while fasting?","Praise be to Allah.The ruling on swimming when fasting depends on the following: 
When can you swim while fasting? 
If the swimmer thinks it most likely that no water will enter his stomach through the mouth or nose , and he is a good swimmer and can guarantee that his fast will not be broken, then in that case there is nothing wrong with him swimming. The ruling is the same as that on doing ghusl when fasting . The scholars have stated that that is permissible even if it is just for the purpose of cooling down. 
Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Chapter on doing ghusl when fasting. Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) wetted his garment and put it on when fasting.” 
Al-Sha’bi entered the hammam (bath) when fasting. And al-Hasan said: There is nothing wrong with the fasting person rinsing his mouth and cooling himself off … and Anas said: I have a tub which I keep immersing myself in when I am fasting. 
Abu Bakr al-Athram narrated with his isnad that Ibn 'Abbas entered the hammam when he was fasting, he and some of his companions, during the month of Ramadan. Al-Mughni, 3/18 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah (10/281): 
“It is permissible to swim during the day in Ramadan, but the swimmer should take care to avoid letting water enter his stomach.”
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“There is nothing wrong with the fasting person swimming, and he may swim as he wants, and immerse himself in the water, but he must be careful to avoid letting water enter his stomach, as much as he can. This swimming will energize the fasting person and help him to fast, and whatever gives a person energy to carry out Allah’s commands should not be disallowed, for it is something that makes it easy for people to carry out His commands. Allah says in the verses on fasting (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you. (He wants that you) must complete the same number (of days), and that you must magnify Allah [i.e. to say Takbir (Allahu Akbar: Allah is the Most Great)] for having guided you so that you may be grateful to Him.” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “This religion is easy, and whoever overburdens himself in religious matters will not be able to continue in that way.” And Allah knows best.”
He also said: 
“There is nothing wrong with a fasting person diving into water or swimming in it, because that is not among the things that break the fast. The basic principle is that things are permissible unless there is evidence to show that they are makruh or haram. There is no evidence that swimming is makruh or haram, rather some of the scholars regarded it as makruh lest anything enter the swimmer’s throat without him realizing it.” (Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 19/284-285) 
When can’t you swim while fasting?
If he thinks it most likely that water will enter his stomach because of swimming, then it is not permissible for him to do this, and it is haram for him to go swimming during the day in Ramadan. The evidence for that is the report narrated from Laqit ibn Sabirah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, tell me about wudu’. He said: “Do wudu’ well, make the water go between your fingers and toes, and go to extremes in rinsing the nose, unless you are fasting.” Narrated by Abu Dawud (142) and al-Tirmidhi (788), who said it is hasan sahih. Classed as sahih by Ibn Hajar and al-Albani. 
Imam Ahmad said that a fasting person may immerse himself in water if he does not fear that it will get into his ears. 
Al-Hasan and al-Sha’bi regarded it as makruh to immerse oneself in water, lest water get into the ears. al-Mughni (3/18). 
Al-Adhra’i (one of the Shafi’i fuqaha’) said: 
“If he knows that water usually enters his stomach when he immerses himself in water, and he cannot avoid it, it is haram for him to immerse himself.” (Hashiyat al-Bujayrami, 2/74)
The question now is: if he goes to extremes in rinsing his nose – and similarly if he immerses himself in water and swims during the day in Ramadan – and water reaches his stomach without him intending it to, whether he thought it most likely that water would not enter his stomach or not – is he regarded as having broken the fast? 
The scholars differed concerning that. 
The first view is that of the majority of Hanafi, Maliki and Shafi'i scholars, which is that his fast is invalidated. 
The second view is that it is not invalidated. This is the view of some of the Tabi'in, and is the view of the Hanbalis, and was the view favoured by Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him). Al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (6/407). 
See: al-Majmu’ (6/338); al-Mughni (3/18). 
You must also be careful to avoid showing the ‘awrah when swimming. Do not swim in a place where people uncover their ‘awrahs, and do not take lightly the issue of looking at the ‘awrahs of others.

Rather marriage is permitted on any day of the year. 
But the one who is fasting in Ramadan must refrain from eating, drinking and intercourse from dawn until sunset. So if he can control himself and there is no fear of him doing something that will break his fast, there is nothing wrong with him getting married in Ramadan. 
It seems that those who want to start married life in Ramadan usually cannot be patient and keep away from their new wives throughout the day, and there is the fear that they may do something that is forbidden and they may fall into grave sin, for which it is obligatory to make up that day’s fast and offer a severe expiation , which is freeing a slave; if that is not possible then they must fast for two consecutive months; if that is not possible then they must feed sixty poor persons. If intercourse happens repeatedly on a number of days, then this expiation must also be repeated for the same number .  
Our advice to this questioner is that if there is the fear that he may not be able to control himself, he should delay his marriage until just after Ramadan, and he should keep himself busy during Ramadan, with worship, reading Quran, praying qiyam, and other acts of worship.

    If the one who does not pray denies that prayer is 
    obligatory, then he is a kaafir according to scholarly consensus. If he 
    affirms that prayer is obligatory, but he does not pray out of laziness and 
    carelessness, then he is also a kaafir according to the correct scholarly 
    opinion, because of evidence that is well known, some of which has been 
    quoted in the answer to question number
    2182. 

    Based on this opinion, the zakaah, fasting and Hajj of one 
    who does not pray is not valid, and it is not permissible for a Muslim woman 
    to allow him to be intimate with her until he repents and starts to pray. 

    The wife has to pay zakaat al-fitr of behalf of herself, and 
    if she pays it on behalf of her children that is fine. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
    Zakaat al-fitr is obligatory and like all other obligatory duties, each 
    person is obliged to do it for himself. So you, O man, are obliged to pay 
    zakaah on your own behalf, even if you have a father or brother. Similarly, 
    the wife is obliged to pay zakaah on her own behalf, even if she has a 
    husband. End quote. 

    Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen,

    Based on this, you should pay zakaat al-fitr on your own behalf. As for the children, if they are young then you should pay it on 
    their behalf, and it does not matter if that is done without the father's 
    knowledge.

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) never failed to offer this prayer, whether he was at home or travelling. 
`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not adhere more firmly to any nafl prayer than the two rak’ahs of Fajr.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1163; Muslim, 724) 
Virtues of Fajr Sunnah prayer
Concerning the virtue of the two rak`ahs before Fajr prayer, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The two rak'ahs of Fajr are better than this world and everything in it.” (Narrated by Muslim, 725)
What to recite in the Sunnah prayer before Fajr
It is Sunnah to recite in these two rak'ahs al-Kafirun and al-Ikhlas , because Muslim (726) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited in the two rak’ahs of Fajr: “Qul ya ayyuhal-kafirun” and “Qul huwa Allahu Ahad.” 
Can we make up the Sunnah prayer before Fajr?
The one who misses the Sunnah prayer before Fajr may offer it after Fajr prayer . 
The evidence for that is the report narrated by al-Tirmidhi (422) and Abu Dawud (1267) from Qays ibn ‘Amr who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came out when the iqamah for prayer had been given, and I prayed Fajr with him, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) finished and found me praying. He said, “Take it easy, O Qays. Two prayers together?” I said, “O Messenger of Allah, I did not pray the two rak’ahs before Fajr.” He said, “No, then.” According to the version narrated by Abu Dawud, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) remained silent. This hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi. 
Al-Khattabi said: 
“This shows that the one who misses the two rak'ahs before the obligatory prayer may offer them after the prayer, before the sun rises.” (`Awn al-Ma’bud)
It says in Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi: 
“Two prayers together?” is a question in the sense of denouncing, i.e., two obligatory prayers at the time of one obligatory prayer? Because there is no nafl prayer after Fajr. 
“No, then.” 
It should be noted that the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “No, then,” mean: there is nothing wrong with you offering these two rak'ahs at that time. This is indicated by the report of Abu Dawud, where it says, “and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) remained silent.” And ‘Ata ibn Abi Rabah narrated that a man of the Ansar said: “He did not say anything to him.” Al-'Iraqi said: its isnad is hasan. And a version narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah says: “He did not tell him to do that or tell him not to do it.” And a version narrated by Ibn Hibban says: “he did not denounce him.” The reports explain one another.”

This misery that you are feeling is nothing more than whispers from the shaytaan (waswaas) who keeps tries to find opportunities to mislead the believer until he causes his doom in this world and in the Hereafter. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Secret counsels (conspiracies) are only from Shaytaan (Satan), in order that he may cause grief to the believers. But he cannot harm them in the least, except as Allaah permits. And in Allaah let the believers put their trust”

“in order that he may cause grief to the believers” this is the purpose of his plots. End quote. 
The sincere believer is able, by the strength of his faith and his trust in his Lord, and his acceptance of what Allaah has decreed for him, to overcome everything that makes him unhappy or worried. 
Your situation is easy. Allaah has given you the opportunity of long nights in which you may fulfil your desire with your wife, and during the day you can keep busy with reading Qur’aan, doing good deeds, visiting brothers, taking care of household needs, and attending halaqahs and lessons.  You can organize your time in this manner, and it will all be good, in sha Allaah. 
You may also touch your wife without having intercourse, so long as you are confident that you will not do anything haraam. 
See question no.  49614 and 20032. 
You do not have any concession allowing you to have intercourse with your wife during the day in Ramadaan, rather you must beware of that, for the month of Ramadaan is very sacred and it is not permissible to violate that sanctity by breaking the fast with no excuse such as travelling or sickness. Whoever breaks the fast during the day in Ramadaan by having intercourse has committed a grave sin for which a severe expiation must be offered, which is described in questions no. 1672 and 49750.

Undoubtedly this is something essential, which every Muslim should strive to do, so that he will be following the Quran and Sunnah. 
Al-Shawkaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Irshaad al-Fuhool (450-451): 
Undoubtedly the common man should ask the scholar, and the one who is imperfect should ask the one who is perfect, so he should refer to people of knowledge who are known for their religious commitment and piety.

Secondly: 
Yes, it is mustahabb for the Muslim to read Quran a great deal during Ramadan and to strive to complete it, but that is not obligatory, i.e., if he does not complete the Quran he is not sinning, but he has missed out on a great deal of reward. The evidence for that is the report narrated by al-Bukhari (4614) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: Jibreel used to review the Quran with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) once every year, and he reviewed it with him twice in the year in which he passed away.

It was narrated that Ibraaheem al-Nakha’i said: al-Aswad used to complete the Quran in Ramadan every two nights. Al-Siyar (4/51). 
Qataadah used to complete the Quran in seven days, and when Ramadan came, he would complete it every three days. When the last ten days came, he would complete it every night. Al-Siyar (5/276). 
It was narrated from Mujaahid that he used to complete the Quran every night in Ramadan. Al-Tibyaan by al-Nawawi (p. 74). He said: Its isnaad is saheeh. 
It was narrated that Mujaahid said: ‘Ali al-Azdi used to complete the Quran every night in Ramadan. Tahdheeb al-Kamaal (2/983). 
Al-Rabee’ ibn Sulaymaan said: al-Shaafa’i used to complete the Quran sixty times in Ramadan. Al-Siyar (10/36). 
Al-Qaasim ibn al-Haafiz ibn ‘Asaakir said: My father used to pray in congregation and read Quran regularly. He would complete it every week, and every day in Ramadan. Al-Siyar (20/562). 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on how often the Quran should be completed: 
The best view is that that varies from one person to another. The one who is seeking to understand it and ponder its meaning should limit himself to as much as he can understand fully when he reads, and the one who is busy spreading knowledge or other religious works, or working for the public interests of the Muslims, should limit himself to what will not cause him to neglect his work. 
If he is not among the categories mentioned here, then he should do as much as he can without reaching the point of boredom. End quote.

However it is mustahabb to read Quran and complete it in Ramadan, and that remains mustahabb but it is not one of the obligatory duties and the Muslim is not sinning if he does not do it. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it obligatory for the fasting person to complete the Quran in Ramadan? 
He replied: 
Completing the Quran in Ramadan is not obligatory for the fasting person, but he should read the Quran a great deal in Ramadan, as that is the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to review it with Jibreel every Ramadan.

65763,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65763,There is no zakaah on machinery; zakaah of one who is in debt,My brother need help to calculate zakat..... he is not sure what will be his zakat as he has loans and his deposits are just three months old...though he has machinery in his factory....will he pay zakat on that... kindly explain the situation so i can make him understand.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    Whoever possesses wealth on which zakaah is due, and owes a 
    debt, must pay the zakaah; the debt does not make any difference. This is 
    the view of Imam al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him). 

    That is because of the general meaning of the evidence which 
    indicates that zakaah is due on one who possesses wealth that reaches the 
    minimum threshold (nisaab). 

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    used to send his agents to collect zakaah, and he did not tell them to ask 
    whether those who had wealth owed debts or not. 

    Zakaah has to do with the wealth itself, and the debt has to 
    do with the person’s obligations, and the one does not rule out the other. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: As for 
    the debt that he owes, that does nor rule out zakaah according to the 
    soundest scholarly opinion. End quote from Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn 
    Baaz, 14/189. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
    What I think is most likely to be correct is that zakaah is obligatory 
    regardless of debt; even if a person owes a debt that reduces the nisaab, 
    except a debt which is due before zakaah before due, in which case he should 
    pay it off and then pay zakaah on whatever is left after that. End quote 
    from al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/39. 

    See: al-Majmoo’, 5/317; Nihaayat al-Muhtaaj, 
    3/133; al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 23/247. 
Based on this, if one 
    year has passed since the wealth reached the nisaab, then your brother has 
    to pay zakaah, regardless of any debts he may owe. But if the time for 
    paying the debt comes before the time for praying zakaah, then he should pay 
    off the debt, then pay zakaah on what is left. 

    Secondly: 

    If a person owns the nisaab in cash and one year has passed, 
    then he should pay zakaah at a rate of one-quarter of one-tenth (2.5%). This 
    nisaab is the equivalent of 85 grams of gold or 595 grams of silver. 

    The reckoning of the year begins when he takes possession of 
    the nisaab, not when he puts it in the bank. 

    If he invests this money in a manner that is acceptable in 
    sharee’ah, then he must pay zakaah on both the capital and the profit at the 
    time when he pays zakaah on the capital. 

    If the money earns a profit in the last three months of the 
    year, then the year for the capital comes, he must pay zakaah on both the 
    capital and the profit, even though one year has not yet passed for the 
    profit, because it is connected to the capital. 

    It should be noted that putting money in the bank in return 
    for interest is a kind of riba which Allaah and His Messenger have 
    forbidden, and it is a major sin. 

    It is permissible to put money in the bank in cases of 
    necessarily, to protect it, subject to the condition that there be no 
    interest. See questions no. 49677 and 
    22392. 

    Thirdly: 

    Zakaah is only due on the types of wealth specified in 
    sharee’ah, such as cash money, an’aam animals (camels, cattle, sheep and 
    goats) and trade goods. No zakaah is due on houses, cars or buildings that a 
    person owns, unless one intends to trade in them. 

    Factories usually contain products and goods that are for 
    trade, so these are subject to the zakaah on trade goods. Their value should 
    be estimated at the end of the year, and one-quarter of one-tenth of their 
    value should be paid. 

    And they contain fixtures and fittings that are not intended 
    for sale; no zakaah on due on these. 

    It says in Kashshaaf al-Qinaa’ (2/244): No zakaah is due on 
    machinery, the belongings of merchants, the bottles of perfume-sellers, the 
    jars of grocers, and so on, and the same applies to those who deal with oil 
    and honey, except if he intends to sell them (those bottles and jars) with 
    their contents. In that case he must pay zakaah for both bottles and 
    contents, because they are trade goods. End quote. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Zakaah 
    is due from owners of printing presses or factories only on things that are 
    prepared for sale. As for things that are prepared for use, there is no 
    zakaah on them. The same applies to cars, furniture and vessels that are 
    prepared for use – no zakaah is due on them, because of the report narrated 
    by Abu Dawood (may Allaah have mercy on him) in his Sunan with a 
    hasan isnaad from Samurah ibn Jundub (may Allaah be pleased with him), who 
    said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) commanded us to pay zakaah on that which we had prepared for sale.

65773,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65773,He wants to start fasting on the fourth day,Is it permissible to start my sawm on the 4th day of Ramadan?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The fast of Ramadaan is obligatory for every adult, sane 
    Muslim who is able to fast. Whoever meets this description, it is haraam for 
    him not to fast without an excuse, because that is clearly going against the 
    command of Allaah and the command of His Messenger  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him), and it is a transgression against the sanctity of 
    this great month.  

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is 
    prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may 
    become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)”

    [al-Baqarah 2:183] 

    “So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night 
    of) the month (of Ramadan i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Sawm 
    (fasts) that month, and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of 
    days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other 
    days”

    [al-Baqarah 2:185]
Fasting becomes 
    obligatory once it is proven that the month of Ramadaan has begun, by the 
    sighting of the new moon or when the month of Sha’baan is completed with 
    thirty days. 

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “Islam is built on five (pillars): bearing witness that there is no 
    god but Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, establishing 
    regular prayer, paying the zakaah, Hajj, and fasting Ramadaan.” Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 8; Muslim, 16.

    as the excuse no longer applies, whether that is on the fourth day or any 
    other, and you also have to make up the days that you did not fast, because 
    of the verse quoted above in which Allaah says “and whoever is ill or on 
    a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) 
    must be made up] from other days”, i.e., if a sick person or traveller 
    does not fast, then he has to make up the number of days that he missed when

Zakat Al-Fitr is only required from the living who are present at the time when it becomes due. 
The time when Zakat Al-Fitr becomes due is when the sun sets on the last day of Ramadan, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called it Sadaqat Al-Fitr, and Fitr or breaking the fast of Ramadan comes when the sun sets on the night of Eid (i.e., the night before Eid). It is a purification for the fasting person from any idle or obscene speech, and the fast ends when the sun sets. 
If a person dies before the time it becomes obligatory, he does not have to pay this Zakah. If a person lives until the time when it becomes obligatory, then dies before paying it, then it should be paid on his behalf from his wealth because it is still a duty that he owes and becomes a debt that must be paid on his behalf. (See: Al-Majmu`, 6/84; Al-Mugni, 2/358; Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, 23/341) 
Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“If a person dies before the sun sets on the night before `Eid, he does not have to pay Zakat Al-Fitr, because he died before it became obligatory.” (Fiqh Al-`Ibadat, p. 211) 
In conclusion, the deceased person is responsible for this if he died after the time when it became obligatory, which is sunset on the night before Eid. In that case it must be paid on his behalf.
 If he died before the time when it became obligatory – which appears to be the case in the question asked here – then this Zakah is not obligatory. 
If your grandmother gave charity such as food, money, etc. on his behalf, then it is charity given on his behalf and is not Zakat Al-Fitr.

    prayer), let one party of them stand up [in Salaah (prayer)] with you taking

    their positions in the rear”
[al-Nisa’ 
    4:102]
Allaah has 
    enjoined prayer in congregation at times of war, so how about at times of 
    peace? 
Al-Bukhaari 
    (608) and Muslim (1040) narrated that the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) said: “I was thinking of ordering that firewood be 
    gathered, then I would order that the call to prayer be given, then I would 
    order a man to lead the prayer, then I would go to men who do not attend the 
    prayer and I would burn their houses down around them.” In Saheeh Muslim 
    (1044) it says: A blind man came to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allaah, I do not have a guide 
    to bring me to the mosque.” He asked the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) to grant him a concession allowing him to 
    pray in his house, and he granted him that concession, but when he turned to 
    leave he said: “Can you hear the call to prayer?” He said: “Yes.” He said: 
    Then answer it.” So the Muslim should regularly pray in congregation at all 
    times, and not let any worldly distractions keep him away from that. 
Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you 
    who believe! Let not your properties or your children divert you from the 
    remembrance of Allaah. And whosoever does that, then they are the losers”

    [al-Munaafiqoon 63:9]
You should 
    advise your father and remind him of this saheeh evidence, with wisdom and 
    beautiful preaching. 
This ruling 
    applies to offering the five daily prayers in congregation. With regard to 
    Taraweeh, the matter is easier than that. It is permissible for a Muslim to 
    pray Taraweeh at home, although it is better to pray it in congregation in 
    the mosque. 
It is not 
    permissible for a Muslim to devote himself to worldly work at the expense of 
    his worship and prayer. Allaah has described the believers as those who do 
    not let their trade and selling distract them from the remembrance of Allaah 
    and establishing prayer. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“In 
    houses (mosques) which Allaah has ordered to be raised (to be cleaned, and 
    to be honoured), in them His Name is remembered [i.e. Adhaan, Iqaamah, 
    Salaat (prayers), invocations, recitation of the Qur’aan]. Therein glorify 
    Him (Allaah) in the mornings and in the afternoons or the evenings,

    whom neither trade nor sale (business) diverts from the remembrance of 
    Allaah (with heart and tongue) nor from performing As‑Salaat 
    (Iqaamat‑as‑Salaat) nor from giving the Zakaah. They fear a Day when hearts 
    and eyes will be overturned (out of the horror of the torment of the Day of 
    Resurrection).
38. That 
    Allaah may reward them according to the best of their deeds, and add even 
    more for them out of His Grace. And Allaah provides without measure to whom 
    He wills”
[al-Noor 
    24:36-38]
This passage 
    ends with the words “And Allaah provides without measure to whom He wills”, 
    which hints to the one who spends his time in trade and work at the expense 
    of his obedience to his Lord, that provision is in the hand of Allaah and He 
    provides without measure to whom He wills. The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained that when he said: “O people, 
    fear Allaah and be moderate in seeking a living, for no soul will die until 
    it has received all its provision, even if it is slow in coming. So fear 
    Allaah and be moderate in seeking provision; take that which is permissible 
    and leave that which is forbidden.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 2144, from the 
    hadeeth of Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him); classed 
    as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb (1698). 
There is no 
    reason why you should not do what you can to earn a living, but the Muslim 
    should not go to extremes with work and devote all his time to it at the 
    expense of his worship, health and raising his children. He should create a 
    balance between everything. 
We hope that 
    your father will study what we have said and think about it properly. We ask 
    Allaah to guide him to the best of words, deeds and attitudes, and to bless 
    him with a goodly and blessed provision.

In that case she should pray and fast, then if the bleeding resumes, it comes under the rulings on menses, and she is not regarded as mustahaadah [experiencing non-menstrual bleeding) unless the bleeding is continuous, or it only stops briefly. This is according to a fatwa of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) in Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah (p. 275).
Secondly:
Based on that, you have to make up the days that you fasted whilst you were bleeding, if the bleeding did not continue for the rest of the month.
Thirdly:
If the bleeding did continue without ceasing, then you are mustahaadah, and in the next month you should do the following:

You should stop praying and fasting for the duration of your former regular period, then do ghusl and pray. Istihaadah [non-menstrual bleeding] does not prevent a woman from praying and fasting, but she must protect herself by wrapping herself with cotton or heavy cloth to prevent the blood from spreading and contaminating her clothing or the place where she is praying.
If she did not previously have a regular cycle, then she should learn how to distinguish between different types of bleeding, because menstrual blood is dark and thick, has an unpleasant odour, and is usually accompanied by pain (cramps), whereas the bleeding of istihaadah is lighter in colour and is thin.

So menses is the days when the blood is dark and thick; as for the other type of bleeding, it is istihaadah.

If there is no difference in the type of blood, then she should stop praying for six or seven days, because that is the usual length of menses for women, then she should do ghusl and pray.

The woman who is mustahaadah should do wudu (ablution) for every obligatory prayer after the time for it has begun, and she may offer whatever naafil (supererogatory) prayers she wishes with that wudoo’.
