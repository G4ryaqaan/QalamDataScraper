sister cut off ties with me for a year, then she got in touch and asked me 
to forgive her, which I did. But she has not stopped insulting my Islaam 
and attacking me at every chance she gets. I told her several times that 
she is hurting me, but she didn’t stop. After years of suffering, I sent her 
a letter telling me to contact me only if her attitude changed, otherwise, 
not to get in touch. Did I do the right thing?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
Because of the insults that you suffered, there is nothing wrong with what you did, in 
sha Allaah. This would not be considered as ""breaking family ties"", and it may give 
her the opportunity to think about what she has done. 
Al-‘Allaamah al’Safaareeni, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his book Ghidhaa’ 
al-Albaab: ""Ibn Abi Hamzah said: ‘The ties of kinship may be by money, by helping at 
times of need, by warding off harm, by meeting them with a smiling face, and by 
praying for them. The general meaning is that one helps them in good ways as much 
as possible and helps them to resist or fight evil as much as possible. This is the case 
if one’s relatives are righteous, but if they are kaafirs or are wrongdoers, then cutting 
off ties with them for the sake of Allaah is how one maintains the tie, on the condition 
that one tries to warn them, and tells them that the reason for cutting the ties is 
because of their deviation from the truth. At the same time, the connection of making 
du’aa’ for them should remain, and you should pray for them in their absence that 
Allaah will guide them to the Right Path. (al-Tuhfah: Ghidha’ al-Albaab, 1/356).

How to convert to Islam


You are always welcome","Praise be to Allah.Benefits of converting to Islam
It brought us great joy to hear from the noble inquirer expressing interest in accepting Islam.  
Islam is indeed the religion that links the human being to his Lord directly via the belief in the oneness of God and through various acts of worship.  
Alsoو Islam instills peace of mind and an inner serenity to the created human being, embodied in a unique relationship and devout tranquillity, encompassing love for, fear of, hope from, and submission to God Almighty, Allah. 
Indeed, this essence is the true meaning of worship, which comprises and combines acts of the heart with acts of the tongue in remembering God, in addition to the acts of the physical organs.  
This is manifested through prayer, fasting, paying zakah (the poor due), and reading the Noble Quran, among other acts, which you will find resulting in positive and benevolent effects in yourself, God willing (in sha Allah).  
No doubt that if you decide to accept Islam that the conclusion which you will have reached was due to two things: (1) a sound mind and (2) success granted from God (Allah).
How to convert to Islam
As for converting to Islam, it is a very simple and easy thing, consisting of your pronouncing the two testimonies of faith. You will find the details regarding this as well as other relevant information in the answers to questions # , 179 , and 378 .

The answer to this question is presumably quite clear to all Muslims, because it is one of the

In answer to this question, it is sufficient to quote one aayah and one hadeeth.
The aayah is (interpretation of the meaning): ""And whoever seeks a religion other than Islaam, 
it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers."" [Aal 
‘Imraan 3:85]
The hadeeth is: ""By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, there is no-one of this 
ummah, Jew or Christian, who hears of me then dies without believing in that with which I have 
been sent, but he will be one of the people of Hell."" (Reported by Muslim, may Allaah have mercy on

The 
  act that your friend committed is a great sin and crime. He must repent to Allah. 
  The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allah be upon 
  him) said: ""the eyes fornicate, the hands fornicate, the legs commit 
  fornication, and the private parts commit fornication"". (It is reported 
  by Ahmad and it is in sahih Al Jahni 4150.) 
Tell 
  your friend that he has to increase in good deeds so that Allah will wipe out 
  his evil deeds, as Abdullah ibn Masud reported. He said that a man came to the 
  Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, Oh Messenger 
  of Allah  (peace and blessings of Allah be upon 
  him), I met a woman in the garden so I pulled her close, fondled her, kissed 
  her, and did everything with except have intercourse. The Prophet  
  (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was then silent and so the verse 
  came down, ""verily, the good deeds erase the bad deeds, that is admonition 
  to those who remember."" So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah 
  be upon him) called him and recited it to him. So Umar (may Allah be pleased

  He said  (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)

There 
  are more details on repenting from fornication. Refer to question #624. 
  As for your question regarding whether he is considered to have committed fornication, 
  which is punishable by stoning, it is obligatory that the married fornicator 
  be stoned and the unmarried fornicator receive lashes. This is only if the sexual 
  organs of the fornicator penetrate the vagina of the woman. Whatever is similar 
  deserves a different punishment, depending on the level of the haram committed. 
  It is not obligatory that he admit to a judge what he did. It is sufficient 
  that repentance take place between him and Allah, and Allah is the Acceptor 
  of repentance and the Most Merciful. We ask Allah to forgive us and the rest 
  of the Muslims.

731,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/731,"Saying that
    specific people are going to Paradise or Hell","I have heard in certain lectures given by
      the shaikhs here in America who consider themselves Salafee, say things like this: My
      mother is a kafira and I KNOW she is going to hell. 
      Saying that they know for sure that a certain person is going to hell. 
      Is this permissible in Islam? Can we say that a certain person is going to Jahannam
      because of their religion?",,,"Praise be to Allah.According to Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah, the
    basic principle is that the issue of who will go to Paradise and who will go to Hell is
    the matter of ‘aqeedah based on what is said in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and
    there is no room for reasoning or ijtihaad in this matter.
If the Qur’aan or Sunnah says that a specific person will be in
    Paradise or Hell, we bear witness to that. At the same time we hope that those who do good
    will go to Paradise and fear that those who do bad will go to Hell, but Allaah knows best
    how people will end up.
The issue of saying who will go to Paradise or Hell may be divided into
    two categories:
General statements, which have to do with people’s qualities, such
        as saying, “Whoever associates anything with Allaah in an act of major shirk is a
        kaafir who is beyond the pale of Islam, and will be in Hell.”

Similarly we say that whoever fasts Ramadaan out of faith and in the
      hope of receiving reward will be forgiven his previous and future sins, and that an
      acceptable Hajj has no other reward but Paradise. There are many such statements in the
      Qur’aan and saheeh Sunnah.
If a person asks, “Will the one who calls on anything other than
      Allaah and seeks the help of anyone but Allaah be in Paradise or Hell?” we would say
      that he is a kaafir who will be in Hell, if he is shown clear evidence that he is wrong
      but he stills persists and dies believing that.
If it were said, Whoever does Hajj then does not commit any obscene or
      immoral act, and dies after his Hajj, for example, what will his fate be? We would say
      that he is in Paradise. Or the person whose last words in this life are Laa ilaaha
      ill-Allaah will be in Paradise, and so on.
All of this has to do with people’s qualities and does not apply
      to any specific, named person.
Specific statements referring to people by name, stating that a
        particular person will be in Paradise or in Hell. This is not permissible except in cases
        where Allaah or His Messenger 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) have informed
        us of it.
Whoever Allaah or His Messenger have mentioned by name and stated that
      they will be in Paradise are definitely among the people of Paradise, such as the ten who
      were given the good news of Paradise (al-‘asharah al-mubashsharah), foremost among
      whom are the four Khulafa’, Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq, ‘Umar, ‘Uthmaan and
      ‘Ali, may Allaah be pleased with them.
Those who the Qur’aan and Sunnah mention by name and state that
      they will be in Hell are definitely among the people of Hell, such as Abu Lahab and his
      wife, Abu Taalib, ‘Amr ibn Lahiy, and others.
We ask Allaah to make us among the people of Paradise by His Grace and
      Mercy. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
734,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/734,Can You Read Surat Yasin for the Dead?,"In my culture, people read Surat Yasin in groups before and after people die. I would like to know whether this is based on the Sunnah or an innovation?","Reading Surat Yasin for one who is dying has been reported from some of the Companions. Regarding reading Surat Yasin for the dead,  there is no sahih hadith to indicate that this should be done.","Reading Yasin for one who is dying


Reading Surat Yasin for the dead","Praise be to Allah.Reading Yasin for one who is dying
We have to make a distinction here between the two issues: reading Surat Yasin for one who is dying, and reading it for one who has died. 
With regard to reading Surat Yasin for one who is dying, this practice has been reported from some of the Companions. 
Imam Ahmad reported in his Musnad from Safwan: “My shaykhs told me that they were with Ghudayf ibn al-Harith al-Thumani when he was dying. He said: ‘Can any of you read Yasin ?’ So Salih ibn Shurayh al-Sakuni recited it, and when he reached the fortieth verse, Ghudayf passed away. My shaykhs used to say that when it is recited in the presence of one who is dying, it eases the pain of death.” That was the opinion of Safwan. ‘Isa ibn al-Mu’tamir read it for Ibn Mab’ad (when the latter was dying).” (Al-Musnad, 16355)
Al-Albani said in Irwa al-Ghalil, 3/152: “This is a sahih sanad going back to Ghudayf ibn al-Harith, may Allah be pleased with him. Its men are thiqat apart from ‘the shaykhs’ who are not named and are therefore unknown (majhul). But the fact that they are unknown is compensated for by their large number, especially since they are of the generation of the Tabi’in (Successors)…”
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ fi Ahkam al-Janaiz: “Surat Yasin may be recited over him (i.e., the one who is dying) for the one who thinks that the hadith is correct.” He explained that this is because this surah contains good news of Paradise, as in the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): “It was said: ‘Enter Paradise.’…” [Yasin 36:26], and because it makes the passage of the soul easier, and other reasons.
Reading Surat Yasin for the dead
As regards reading Surat Yasin for one who has died, there is no sahih hadith to indicate that this should be done. A hadith was narrated by Abu Dawud and others which says “Read Yasin over your dead”, but this hadith is not sahih because its isnad contains contradictions and narrators who are unknown (majhul). This was stated by al-‘Allamah al-Albani in Irwa al-Ghalil, hadith no. 688. 
Reading Quran over the dead is considered to be a bid`ah (innovation), as he states at the end of his book Ahkam al-Janaiz.
Some people think that it should be read forty times over the deceased, and some of them may distribute copies of the Quran among the mourners who gather to offer condolences so that they may read, or organize gatherings in the mosque to read it for the soul of the deceased. All of this has no basis whatsoever (in the sunnah), and these are innovated deeds of bid`ah which we should avoid and warn others against. And Allah is the Source of strength.

After one year, you can take your million back. Is this considered to be ribaa or not? Please advise us, may Allaah reward you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This

          sell with it and keep the profits for themselves. This condition brings 
          benefits, so it is an invalid condition according to the consensus of

          million that you borrowed from them, and not another million to benefit

          of the Muslim scholars. The bank is not entitled to anything except 
          getting its money back, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
          
“O 
          you who believe! Be afraid of Allaah and give up what remains (due to 
          you) from Ribaa (from now onward) if you are (really) believers.

“And come not near to unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a faahishah (a great sin) and an evil way.” [al-Israa’ 17:32]

Shaytaan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allaah and from al-salaah. So, will you not then abstain?” [al-Maa’idah 5:90-91]

(Sunan al-Tirmidhi, no. 2746; classified as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 4130)
Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""Allah loves sneezing and dislikes yawning. If any one of you sneezes and says Al-hamdu Lillah, it is a duty on everyone who hears him to say Yarhamak Allah. As for yawning, if any one of you feels the urge to yawn, let him resist it as much as he can, and do not say Hah, hah (do not make a noise when yawning), for this is from Shaytan and he laughs at it."" Abu ‘Isa said: This is a sahih hadith. (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 2747)
Abu Said al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""If any of you yawns, let him cover his mouth lest the Shaytan enter."" (Abu Dawud)
Abu Said al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""If any of you feels the urge to yawn, let him resist it as much as possible, lest the Shaytan enter his mouth."" (Imam Ahmad)
According to another report also narrated by Imam Ahmad, Shaytan enters when a person yawns. (Sahih al-Jami’, 426)
What to do if you yawn
From the reports quoted above, we may summarize the following:
·        That Shaytan prompts the human to yawn, which is indicative of laziness and sluggishness.
·        That Shaytan enters the person who yawns.
·        That Shaytan laughs at man and makes fun of his ugly appearance when he is in that state.
What to do if you yawn while praying
The person who is praying must take care of the following:
·        He should resist yawning.
·        He should cover his mouth.
·        He should suppress his voice (not make a sound).

756,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/756,Ruling of non-Muslim Fasting,"When is the month of Ramadan and can someone like me fast properly? What time 
of the day am I supposed to fast?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The fact that you have concern with the blessed month of Ramadhan, are questioning it's arrival, 
and anticipating it, is very wonderful. It indicates that you are affected by this great Islamic 
worship, which consists of abstaining from food and drink, and sexual intercourse from fajr (the 
break of dawn), until maghrib ( the sunset) during the day of the noble month of Ramadhan.
As far as it's appointed time, my dear respected questioner, the laws of worship in Islam are 
scheduled according to proof which is clearly traceable and detectable. The evidence which is 
seen is not estimated. This entails the sighting of the moon, which indicates that the month of 
Ramadhan has begun. So, if we see the new moon, or it is established that someone amongst us 
has seen the new moon, then it becomes obligatory on the entire Muslim community to fast every 
day of this month, until we see the new moon for the following month of Shawwal and know that 
therefore Ramadhan has ended.
The month of Ramadhan on the Islamic calendar could be 29 or 30 days depending on the 
sighting of the physical proof, which is the new moon. According to the Christian calender, the 
approximate time of Ramadhan this year would occur on the 30th or 31st of December 1997.
In order for your fast to be correct and accepted, you must first enter Islam by testifying to 
Allah's Oneness and believing in the Prophet and following the laws of Islam. We would be 
happy to see you living a happy life with strong faith, and good years to come, spending them 
inspired by Islam. We ask Allah to protect you and guide you along.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

us getting married without me converting and I would also appreciate if I 
could be told where I can read more on this subject.  Thank You.",,,"Praise be to Allah.All Praise be to Allaah. 
To the noble inquirer: 
You have traversed an important part of 
  the path to the truth and directing yourself towards it.  From what I have 
  been able to gather from your question, I understand that you wish to embrace 
  Islam but what is preventing you from doing so is fear for your sick mother's 
  health upon hearing the news.  I want you to know that overcoming this 
  obstacle is an easy matter, as it is possible for you in a practical way, to 
  conceal your acceptance of Islam and not divulge it.  You are not required 
  to announce your acceptance of Islam in an Islamic center or anywhere else; 
  all that is required is the pronouncing of the two testimonies of faith (see 
  question(s) ) and the initiation of practicing the rites of the religion.  
  You can pray in private, undisclosed places, for example.  In addition, 
  fasting will not be difficult as you can easily advance any appropriate excuse 
  for not eating if something is offered to you during the daylight hours of the 
  month of fasting. 
Now, I would like to remind you of two 
  things: 
Firstly, that the driving factor and underlying 
  truth regarding wanting to embrace the religion must be to gain the pleasure 
  and acceptance of your Lord--Allaah, the Most Glorified and All-High, who does 
  not accept any religion other than Islam, as He has said in his Glorious Book 
  (the Qur'aan), [interpretation of the meaning]: ""And whoever seeks a religion 
  other than Islam--it will never be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he 
  will be among the losers."" (The Family of Imran, verse 3:85)  It has 
  been narrated by Abu Hurairah, may Allaah be please with him, that Allaah's 
  Messenger  (peace be upon him) said: ""By 
  Him in whose hand Muhammad's  soul is (i.e., 
  God, Allaah), there is none from amongst the Jews and the Christians (of these 
  present nations to whom I have been sent) who hears about me and then dies without 
  believing in the message with which I have been sent (i.e. Islamic monotheism), 
  but he will be among the dwellers of the Hellfire."" (Sahih Muslim, Book 
  of Faith, #240). 
Thus, your objectives in entering Islam 
  are to save yourself from being among the permanent dwellers of Hell in the 
  Hereafter, and to achieve the fantastic reward of the bliss of Heaven, the vastness 
  of which is greater than that of the earth and the skies.  Your overriding 
  motive for accepting Islam should not be emotions stemming from your relationship 
  with the Muslim man with whom you are in love.  Your embracing Islam is 
  something necessary for yourself whether you marry this man or not. 
Secondly, obeying God (Allaah) and His 
  Prophet Muhammad  (peace be upon him) has a 
  higher priority than your closest relative and most beloved dear one even if 
  it is your mother or your spouse or anyone else.  The Prophet of guidance 
  has said  :  ""There are three qualities, 
  for which whoever is characterized by them will relish the sweetness of faith:  
  one to whom Allaah and His Messenger are dearer than all else; one who loves 
  a man only for Allaah's sake; and one who abhors returning to apostasy after 
  Allaah has rescued him from it as he abhors being cast into Hell."" (Sahih 
  al-Bukhari, Book of Faith, #15). 
He  also 
  said:  ""No worshipper (and in the hadeeth narrated by 'Abdul-Warith, 
  no person) is a truthful believer, until I am dearer to him than the members 
  of his household, his wealth and the whole of mankind."" (Sahih al-Bukhari, 
  Book of Faith #14). 
I ask Allaah to hasten you to Islam and 
  to help you firmly establish yourself in it, and to grant you a righteous and 
  successful marriage as well as a blessed family.  Indeed, Allaah is the 
  One who guides to the path of truth, success, and righteousness.

762,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/762,Ruling on wearing one’s clothes below one’s ankles,"Assalamu Alaikum
A brother was telling me that wearing clothing below the ankles is haram and that 
there are many hadiths that prove this. I would appreciate your opinion on this 
matter.
Jazakallah",,,"Praise be to Allah.
What your friend has told you is true. Many ahaadeeth were reported from the Prophet 
 
(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) which forbid isbaal (wearing ones clothes below 
the ankles), for example:
Al-Bukhaari reported that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
said: ""Whatever of the izaar (lower garment) is below the ankles is in the Fire."" (al-Bukhaari, no. 
5787)
The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""There are three whom 
Allaah will not look at or praise on the Day of Judgement and theirs will be a painful 
punishment: the one who wears his garment below his ankles, the one who reminds others of his 
favours, and the one who sells his product by means of making false oaths"" (reported by Muslim, 
no. 106)
The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Isbaal (wearing ones 
garment below the ankles) may apply to the izaar (lower garment), the shirt or the turban. 
Whoever allows any part of these to trail on the ground out of arrogance, Allaah will not look at 
him on the Day of Judgement."" (reported by Abu Dawud, no. 4085, and al-Nisaai, no. 5334, with a saheeh 
isnaad).
Ibn Abbaas reported that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
said: ""Allaah will not look at the one who wears his lower garment below his ankles."" (Reported by 
al-Nisaai in al-Mujtabaa, Kitaab al-Zeenah, Baab Isbaal al-Izaar).
Hudhayfah said: ""The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
him) took hold of the muscle of my calf (or his calf) and said, This is where the izaar should 
stop; if you insist, it may be lower, but it should not reach the ankles."" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who 
said this is a saheeh hasan hadeeth; see Sunan al-Tirmidhi, no. 1783)
All of the ahaadeeth quoted above speak against isbaal, whether or not the intention is to show 
off; but if a person does this deliberately out of arrogance, there is no doubt that his sin is 
greater. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Allaah will not 
look at the one who trails his izaar on the ground out of pride."" (al-Bukhaari, no. 5788)
Jaabir ibn Sulaym said: ""The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
upon him) said to me: Beware of wearing ones lower garment below the ankles, because this is 
a kind of showing-off, and Allaah does not love showing-off."" (Regarded as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi, 
no. 2722).
No one is able to be completely free of pride and arrogance, even if he claims that this is so. 
Such a claim is unacceptable, because by saying it, he is praising himself. Only in the case of 
those whom the wahy (revelation) testified that they were free of pride do we believe that this is 
the case. For example, there is a hadeeth which states that the Prophet 
 (peace and 
blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Whoever trails his garment on the ground out of pride, 
Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection."" Abu Bakr said to him, ""O Messenger 
of Allaah, my izaar slips down if I do not pay attention to it."" He said: ""You are not one of 
those who do it out of pride."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 5784)
What indicates that isbaal is prohibited even if it is not done out of pride is the hadeeth of Abu 
Saeed al-Khudri, may Allaah be pleased with him, who said: ""The Messenger of Allaah 
 
(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The lower garment of the Muslim should 
come down to mid-calf, but there is nothing wrong if it is between that point and the ankles. 
Whatever is lower than the ankles is in the Fire. Whoever trails his garment on the ground out of 
pride, Allaah will not look at him."" (Reported by Abu Dawud, no. 4093, with a saheeh isnaad.)
These ahaadeeth describe two different deeds, for which there will be two different 
punishments:
Imaam Ahmad reported that Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Yaqoob said: ""I asked Abu Saeed: Did 
you hear anything from the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
upon him) concerning the izaar (lower garment)? he said, Yes, listen! The izaar of the 
believer should come to mid-calf, although there is nothing wrong if it comes between there and 
the ankles, but whatever is lower than the ankles is in the Fire, and he said it three times.""
Ibn Umar said: ""I passed by the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah 
be upon him), and my izaar had slipped down. He said, O Abdullaah, pull up your izaar! so 
I pulled it up. He said, More! so I pulled it up more, and always made sure it was pulled up 
properly after that."" Some people asked, ""To where did you pull it up?"" He said, ""To mid-calf 
length."" (Reported by Muslim, no. 2086; al-Dhahabi, Kitaab al-Kabaair, 131-132) 
The issue of isbaal applies to women just as much as it applies to men. This is indicated by the 
hadeeth of Ibn Umar, may Allaah be pleased with him, who said: ""The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever trails his garment on the 
ground out of pride, Allaah will not look at him. Umm Salamah said: O Messenger of Allaah, 
what should women do with their hems? He said, Let them go down a handspan. She asked, 
What if their feet show? He said, Let them lengthen it by a cubit, but no more."" (al-Nisaa'i, 
Kitaab al-zeenah, Baab dhuyool al-nisaa).
The punishment for showing off may come to pass in this world, not in the Hereafter. Abu 
Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
him) said: ""Whilst a man was walking arrogantly admiring himself and his clothes, Allaah 
caused the earth to swallow him and he is suffering in it until the Day of Resurrection."" (Reported 
by Muslim, no. 2088).",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
763,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/763,What Benefits the Dead and Can They Hear Those Who Visit?,"My father passed away about two weeks ago. I wanted to know when me or my family members go to his grave, is he able to hear us and what we are saying to him? ...  And if not, is there any way we can have him hear what we say?","What benefits the dead is the following: 1- Offering charity on his behalf, 2- beneficial knowledge which the deceased has left behind, and 3- a righteous child who will make du`a for him.","Can the dead hear the living?


What benefits the dead in Islam?


Other deeds that may also benefit the dead","Praise be to Allah.Can the dead hear the living?
The principle is that the dead do not hear the words of the living, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""but you cannot make hear those in the graves."" [Fatir 35:22] and ""Verily, you cannot make the dead to hear"" [al-Naml 27:80]
When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) addressed the slain disbelievers after the Battle of Badr, Allah caused them to hear his words, although they were at the bottom of the well in which they had been buried. This was a special case, as the scholars, may Allah have mercy on them, have stated. (See Al-Ayat al-Bayyinat fi ‘adam Sama’ al-Amwat).
Perhaps the psychological motive for wishing that your father could hear you is an attempt to do something to re-establish the communication that has been cut, in order to alleviate the pain you are feeling. 
What benefits the dead in Islam?
You should understand, my sister, that Islam has explained what actions on the part of the living may benefit the dead, and what may reach them in their graves. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""When a person dies, all his deeds come to an end except three: sadaqah jariyah (ongoing charity, e.g. a waqf or endowment), beneficial knowledge (which he has left behind), or a righteous child who will pray for him."" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no 1376; he said this is a sahih hasan hadith)

The most important thing that will benefit your father after his death, and that you can do for him now that he is in his grave, is to strive to pray for him and ask for forgiveness and mercy for him, and for Paradise and salvation from the Fire, and other good and beautiful du`as (prayers).

Prayers for forgiveness offered by both sons and daughters of the deceased bring great benefits, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""A man’s status will be raised in Paradise and he will ask, How did I get here? He will be told, By your son’s du’as (prayers) for forgiveness for you."" (Reported by Ibn Majah, no 3660; see also Sahih al-Jami, 1617)

Another thing that may reach the deceased is sadaqah (charity) given on his behalf, because `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported that a man said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): ""My mother has passed away, and if she could have spoken, she would have given something in charity. Will she receive a reward if I give something on her behalf?"" He said, ""Yes."" (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath, 1388)

Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the mother of Sa’d ibn Ubadah (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) died when he was away from her. He said: ""O Messenger of Allah, my mother has died and I am away from her. Will it benefit her anything if I give in charity on her behalf?"" He said, ""Yes."" He said, ""Then I ask you to be my witness that I am giving my garden al-Mikhraf (so called because it bore so many dates) in charity on her behalf."" (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath, 2756)
Abu Hurayrah reported that a man said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): ""My father has died and left money behind. He did not make a wasiyyah (a will); will it expiate for his sins if I give some of it in charity on his behalf?"" He said, ""Yes."" (Reported by al-Nasai)
Sa'd ibn Ubadah said: ""I said: O Messenger of Allah, my mother has died. Should I give charity on her behalf? He said, Yes. I asked, What kind of charity is best? He said, Providing water."" (Reported by al-Nasai)
Other deeds that may also benefit the dead

Other deeds that may also benefit the deceased are Hajj and ‘Umrah on their behalf, after the living person has first performed Hajj and ‘Umrah on his or her own behalf.

‘Abdullah ibn Buraydah reported that his father (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""While I was sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), a woman came to him and said: I gave my mother a slave-woman in charity, and now my mother has died. He said: You have got your reward, and your right of inheritance has brought your gift back to you. She said, O Messenger of Allah, she still had one month to fast. Can I fast it on her behalf? He said, Fast it on her behalf. She said, She never went to Hajj. Can I perform Hajj on her behalf? He said, Perform Hajj on her behalf."" (Reported by Muslim, may Allah have mercy on him, in his Sahih, no. 1149)

This shows that it is also permissible to fast on behalf of the deceased.
Another thing that may benefit the deceased is to fulfil their nadhr (vow), because Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that a woman came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: ""My mother made a vow to perform Hajj but she died before she could do it. Can I perform Hajj on her behalf?"" He said, ""Yes, perform Hajj on her behalf. Don't you think that if your mother owed a debt you would pay it off?"" She said, ""Yes."" He said, ""Then pay off what is owed to Allah, for Allah is more deserving of having vows fulfilled."" (al-Bukhari, al-Fath, 7315)
Another thing that may benefit the deceased is if his relative devotes a share to him of a sacrifice he offers. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) offered a sacrifice, he said: ""In the name of Allah, O Allah, on behalf of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad"" (reported by Muslim, no. 1967) and the family of Muhammad included both the living and the dead.

The question of whether women may visit graves has already been addressed (please see question# 127 )
You should also know that keeping yourself busy with praying for your father is more important and better for you, and more beneficial to the deceased, than thinking about whether he can hear your voice. So try to do whatever will be of benefit both to him and you. You and your family should avoid forbidden innovations (bid’ah) such as marking the fortieth day after death, or the passing of one year since the death, or gatherings for reciting al-Fatihah (the first chapter of surah of the Quran), doing forbidden acts at graves, and so on, deeds which are done by those who are ignorant and are imitated by others.
I ask Allah to forgive your father and have mercy on him and on all the deceased Muslims, for He is the Forgiving, Most Merciful.

Does touching the wife cause breaking of wudu?,The strongest of the statements of the scholars is that touching the wife does not break the wudu unless there is a discharge of sperm.,,"Praise be to Allah.In this issue, the strongest of the statements of the scholars is that touching the wife does not break the wudu, unless there is a discharge of sperm. This is the statement of Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) and it is also from ‘Ali bin Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) as well as Hasan, Mujahid, and Qatadah. 
It is also of the madhhab of Abu Hanifah. Ibn Jarir supports this statement, as well as At-Tabari and Sheikh Al-Islam ibn Taimiyyah. 
The people who support this statement, use as proof the hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said, ""I was sleeping in front of the Messenger of Allah and my legs were in his qiblah. When he prostrated he touched me and I withdrew my legs, and when he stood I stretched them out"". (Homes in those days did not have lamps.) (Al-Bukhari,328)
They also use the hadith where `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) says, ""I noticed the Messenger of Allah was gone one evening from the bed, so I looked for him and my hand landed on the sole of his feet and he was in the mosque. They were close together and he was saying, ""O Allah I seek refuge with You, pleasure from Your anger, and with Your pardon, and from Your punishment. I seek refuge with You from what is falsely attributed to You as praise. You are how You have praised Yourself"". (Muslim, 486)
An-Nawawi states in explaining this hadith that `Aisha’s statement, ""and my hand landed on the soles of his feet when he was in the mosque and they were close together,"" is proof for the one who says that touching the wife does not break wudu. 
Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taimiyyah says the statement of Allah, ""Or ye have been in contact with women"" refers to sex as Ibn Abbas and others from the Arabs have said. It is reported by ‘Ali and others, and it is the correct meaning of the verse. 
There is nothing showing that touching one's wife breaks wudu in the Quran or Sunnah. The Muslims used to touch their wives all the time and not one of the Muslims reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ordered anyone to make wudu because of touching women .

As salaamu 'alaykum",,,"Praise be to Allah.al-hamdu lillaah.
If the Imam ascends the mimbar and greets the audience with the salaam then the 
audience should respond. This would not be considered frivolous discourse and would 
not violate the silence required for listening because the actual khutbah has not yet 
begun. Therefore, until then, the audience can recite praises of Allaah and duaa, and 
also repeat after the muathin who calls for prayer, which is timed after the Imam has 
actually greeted the audience and has taken his place on the mimbar.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
793,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/793,How to Deal with Toxic Family Members in Islam,"This is regarding family matters and disputes.
I have a maternal uncle who creates a lot of trouble for my family. His wife and children have even gone to the limits of taking my mother to court, and falsely bearing witness that she physically assaulted them and threatened to kill them. There are numerous things they do, but, my uncle after a few months fights with his children and comes back and asks my mother for forgiveness. She forgives him, and he starts pretending he is a maskin. But, he continues to support his children and wife who hurt my mother numerous times.
Anyway, I asked my mother NOT to talk to him anymore. She claims we have to forget and forgive. But, surely there are limitations. Anyway, is it wrong to ask my mother not to associate with him anymore? Is it wrong for me to continue to refuse to have anything to do with him or his family? I DO NOT wish to forget or forgive, especially, when there is no change in his behavior.
Any Advice is appreciated.","If you want to deal with your toxic family member on the basis of justice, then it is permissible for you to respond in like to his unkind words. But if you bear it with patience, that will be better for you. If you want to turn enmity into love, then treat him well, if he treats you badly.",,"Praise be to Allah.If you want to deal with your maternal uncle on the basis of justice, then it is permissible for you to respond in like to his unkind words, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""And if you punish (your enemy), then punish them with the like of that with which you were afflicted."" [An-Nahl 16:126]
But if you bear it with patience, that will be better for you, as Allah says at the end of the same verse (interpretation of the meaning): ""But if you endure patiently, verily, it is better for the patient ones."" [An-Nahl 16:126]

If you want to turn enmity into love, then treat him well, if he treats you badly, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one which is better, then verily! He between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend."" [Fussilat 41:34]

The words, ""The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal"" mean that there is a huge difference between the two. ""Repel (the evil) with one which is better,"" means that when someone treats you badly, answer back with something better, as `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""There is no better punishment for the person who sinned by being bad to you, than your obeying Allah by being good to him in return."" (Tafsir Ibn Kathir)

A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: ""O Messenger of Allah, I have relatives with whom I try to keep in touch, but they cut me off; I treat them well, but they treat me badly; I try to be kind to them, but they are cruel to me."" He said: ""If you are as you say, it is as if you are putting hot ashes in their mouths. You will continue to have support from Allah against them so long as you continue doing that."" (Narrated by Muslim, no. 2558)

Our advice to you, our sister, is to be tolerant and forgiving. Follow your mother's advice. It is clear from your question that this man has room to regret and retract his bad actions. Allah tells us (interpretation of the meaning): ""whoever forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is due from Allah"" [Ash-Shura 42:40]

However, all of this does not prevent us from protecting ourselves from the evil and harm that such relatives may cause. If going to their houses, for example, will cause some kind of offence or harm, then the relationship can be limited to telephone calls, kind words, the occasional gift and so on. The relationship can be maintained at a distance, if being too close will cause problems.
We ask Allah to guide us all, to help us not to bear any grudges towards anyone, and to treat one another properly. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.
