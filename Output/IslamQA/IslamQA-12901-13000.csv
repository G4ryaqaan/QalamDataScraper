12902,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12902,"Is it better for a man to divorce his second wife with whom he quarrels, so that she can have some peace?","Is it allowable for a husband to divorce his (second) wife without her doing anything wrong?  This man found out that he does not have much in common with his wife, often fights with her and dislikes things about her through no fault of hers.  Would it not be better to let her free to marry someone who would love her and cherish her than to keep her in a much-less-than ideal situation?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The man has to treat both of his wives 
    fairly, and to fear Allaah with regard to them. The woman should resist her 
    jealousy and strive to control herself (jihad al-nafs) and not cause 
    trouble to her husband because he has another wife.  

    “The basic principle concerning divorce is 
    that it is makrooh (disliked), and if we say that the basic principle 
    is that it is forbidden, this is not far-fetched. This is indicated by the 
    words of Allaah concerning those who take an oath not to have sexual 
    relations with their wives. He said (interpretation of the meaning):  
    

    ‘… then if they return (change their idea in 
    this period), verily, Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. 
    

    And if they decide upon divorce, then Allaah 
    is All-Hearer, All-Knower’ 

    [al-Baqarah 2:226-227]
The aayah ends with 
    these two names, ‘All-Hearer, All-Knower’, if they decide upon 
    divorce, to indicate that Allaah does not like that, because in the case of 
    one who returns or comes back to his wife after swearing not to have 
    intercourse with her, it says that ‘Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most 
    Merciful.’  

    This makes it clear that Allaah likes the one 
    who has sworn such an oath to go back (to his wife). In the case of one who 
    has decided to divorce his wife, the use of the words 
    
    ‘All-Hearer, All-Knower’ indicates that Allaah dislikes that. It 
    was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: ‘The most hated of permissible things to Allaah is divorce.’ This 
    hadeeth is not saheeh, but its meaning is saheeh. Allaah dislikes divorce, 
    but He does not forbid it to His slaves, to make things easier for them. If 
    there is a valid reason for divorce, in sharee’ah or otherwise, then that is 
    permissible. Whether there is a valid reason depends on whether the woman’s 
    remaining married will lead to some shar’i reservation that can only be 
    alleviated by divorce, then he may divorce her, such as when the woman is 
    lacking in religious commitment or chastity, and he is unable to reform her. 
    In such cases, we say that it is better for him to divorce her. But if there 
    is no such valid reason, whether shar’i or otherwise, then we say that it is 
    better not to divorce her; indeed in such a case divorce would be makrooh.”
    

     (As’ilat al-Baab al-Maftooh by Ibn 
    ‘Uthaymeen, p. 113) 

     With regard to the woman mentioned in the 
    question, if she is able to live with her husband in a good manner, and if 
    each of them can put up with the other at times of short-lived anger, then 
    this will be better for her, for him, for their children and for the family 
    of each partner. If a good life cannot continue between them for some reason 
    on the part of one or both of them, and it appears that separation is better 
    for her or for him or for both of them, then Allaah says (interpretation of 
    the meaning):

     “But if they separate (by divorce), 
    Allaah will provide abundance for everyone of them from His Bounty” 
    

    [al-Nisaa’ 4:130]

    Allaah may provide her with a husband better 
    than him, who will be more righteous and treat her more kindly. May Allaah 
    help us all to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Please comment.",If a daughter inherits – whether from her mother or her father – her share of the inheritance may vary according to the situation; please see below for details.,"Daughter’s share in inheritance


Depriving women of inheritance","Praise be to Allah. Daughter’s share in inheritance
If a daughter inherits – whether from her mother or her father – her share of the inheritance may vary according to the situation:
1 – If the daughter is an only child, i.e., she has no brothers or sisters (i.e., heirs who are descendents), then she has a half of the legacy of the deceased. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “…if only one, her share is a half…” [al-Nisa 4:11]
2 – If there is more than one daughter – two or more – and the deceased has no male children, then their share is two-thirds. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“…if (there are) only daughters, two or more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance…” [al-Nisa 4:11]
3 – If there are other male heirs who are descendents of the deceased (one or more), then they are to be given the remainder after each person who is entitled to a share has been given that share. Her share is equal to one-half of her brother’s share (“to the male, a portion equal to that of two females”), whether they are two or whether the children include both males and females. The male takes a share equal to that of two females. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Allah commands you as regards your children’s (inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females” [al-Nisa 4:11]
Depriving women of inheritance
These are the shares which have been decreed by Allah. So it is not permissible for anyone to change any part of them, or to deprive an heir , or to bring in anyone who is not an heir, or to deprive an heir of any part of his inheritance or to give him more than the share allotted to him by Shari`ah.

12913,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12913,Advice for daa’iyahs travelling abroad,We are young men who are travelling to the west to call people to Allaah. We hope that you could give us some advice that will help us during our trip. May Allaah preserve you and take care of you.,,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          Calling people to Allaah is one of the most essential 
          duties, and it is the way of the Prophets and Messengers and their followers, 
          namely the scholars, daa’iyahs and reformers. Hoping that you will be 
          able to fulfil the purpose of your da’wah trip and make the most of 
          your precious time with which you seek to earn reward from Allaah, we 
          offer you the following advice:  
 
          1 – Fear Allaah (taqwa) and be aware that He is watching 
          you in secret and in public. The Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Fear Allaah wherever 
          you may be…” (narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1910; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani 
          in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 1618). Fearing Allaah is the main thing, 
          and it is the means of being granted strength in this world and reward 
          in the Hereafter. And seek reward with Allaah and have sincerity of 
          intention towards Allaah in all that you say and do. “Actions are but 
          by intentions and every man shall have but that which he intended.” 
          (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1; Muslim, 3530). These are things which will 
          help the daa’iyah and make his actions blessed, just as fearing Allaah 
          is the main thing, and it is the means of being granted strength in 
          this world and reward in the Hereafter. 
 
          2 – Be a good example in your words, appearance, eating 
          and sleeping. In all of that, follow the example of the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in his words and actions. 
 
          3 – Strive to lower your gaze, especially in countries 
          where display of women’s charms is prevalent and there is no veiling. 
 
          4 – It is preferable to wear Arabic clothing because 
          that serves many interests. It is not preferable to wear European clothing. 
          With regard to what is said about the dangers of wearing Arabic clothing 
          abroad, these are merely rumours and have no basis in reality. One may 
          take off the headcover and wear only the cap if necessary. 
 
          5 – The siwaak is one of the Sunnahs of the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and it is rare in most countries, 
          so it is a gift which will be appreciated by many Muslims. 
 
          6 – Use your hand-luggage for clothes, because it is 
          possible that luggage may be lost in those countries.  This also 
          frees up room in your suitcases for the books you will need. Change 
          your money into dollars so that you will have it available to spend 
          during your trip. 
 
          7 – Take all the necessary precautions before travelling, 
          such as vaccinations against the diseases that are prevalent in the 
          countries to which you are travelling. Take the yellow international 
          vaccination card with you. 
 
          8 – Take all the addresses that you will need with you, 
          such as the addresses of the embassies of some Arab and Muslim countries, 
          and the addresses of well known and trustworthy Islamic centers and 
          organizations. 
 
          Beware of giving the impression to the Muslims with whom 
          you mix that you have come to offer them material help, because this 
          opens the door to requests for help and personal demands. Indeed, some 
          people may think that you have a lot of money with you and will lie 
          in wait to do you harm. But this does not mean that you cannot take 
          some zakaah and charity with you, to give to needy people once you are 
          sure of their need, but this must be done with caution and secretly. 
 
          9 – Do not indulge in unnecessary talk, and beware of 
          referring to matters of marriage, even in a joking manner, especially 
          with interpreters. There have been unfortunate cases where some daa’iyahs 
          got married at the beginning of their trips and got divorced at the 
          end, which has led to tarnishing of the reputation of the daa’iayahs 
          and neglect of children and wives. 
 
          10 – Equip yourself with the following: 
 
          ·A pocket-sized copy of 
          the Qur’aan, preferably with a translation of the meanings and footnotes 
          describing the reasons for revelation.
 
          ·A book or two about 'aqeedah (beliefs, doctrines), especially Tawheed (Divine Oneness) and refutation of misguided groups such as the Sufi tareeqahs.
 
          ·One or two books on the 
          fiqh of worship, especially the fiqh of tahaarah (purity), prayer and 
          fasting.
 
          ·Riyaadh al-Saaliheen 
          by Imam al-Nawawi, which is a comprehensive resource, especially which 
          regard to the fiqh of tahaarah and fasting.
 
          ·Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah 
          (fatwas of the Standing Committee)
 
          ·A selection of lessons 
          and lectures recorded on tapes, so that one may make use of them especially 
          during long car journeys.
 
          ·Keep with you a compass 
          for determining the direction of the Qiblah and an alarm clock. It is 
          preferable to buy a small tape recorder to record some words and interviews 
          with local inhabitants when necessary, as well as da’wah meetings.  
          
 
          The things mentioned above will help the daa’iyah to 
          prepare talks, lessons and lectures, and to answer questions. It will 
          also help him to organize his time and make the most of it, in sha Allah. 
 
          11 – Use your time as much as possible to benefit the 
          da’wah, so that your visit will be a gain for the Muslims in that country. 
          Make the most of every opportunity to do good and do not hesitate. That 
          should be done by coordinating with the brothers in charge of organizing. 
           
 
          12 – When discussing any topic or issue, pay attention 
          to the fact that people may be lacking in knowledge or ignorant, and 
          that there may be differences of madhhabs. Avoid indulging in controversial 
          issues or stereotyping people, and try to explain the truth without 
          criticizing individuals.  
 
          13 – Wisdom is one of the most important basics in calling 
          people to Allaah, especially when travelling. It is essential when prioritizing 
          and outlining the steps to be taken to achieve one’s goals, and it is 
          also required when dealing with different types of people. It is wise 
          to show due respect to people according to their status and to acknowledge 
          their positions. 
 
          14 – The daa’iyah will find that some questions of fiqh 
          are posed to him during his trip, especially after giving lessons and 
          talks. He should be deal with this matter in a proper way, replying 
          to questions with evidence and quoting the words of the scholars, or 
          else saying “I don’t know”. It was said that “the one who says ‘I don’t 
          know’ has issued a fatwa (answered the question).” There is nothing 
          to stop you delaying giving an answer until you have had time to review 
          the matter. 
 
          15 – It is better for the members of the group to take 
          turns in giving lessons and talks. We do not think that only one person 
          should take all the responsibility so that he becomes the mufti and 
          khateeb and preacher, even if he is more capable, because one of the 
          aims of these trips is to offer practical da’wah training to the daa’iyahs. 
          These trips offer a valuable opportunity for training in preaching and 
          giving khutbahs, especially for brothers who find it difficult to do 
          that in their home country because there are so many scholars and seekers 
          of knowledge there. 
 
          16 – Getting to know about the situation of the Muslims, 
          by finding out about the Islamic situation in general and the situation 
          of local Islamic organizations and institutions, both official and non-official, 
          in particular; writing down their addresses and reports on their activities; 
          finding out about prominent and influential Muslim personalities in 
          the society; attempting to win them over by visiting them and speaking 
          to them nicely, so as to advance the cause of Islam and the Muslims. 
          All of this must be done within the guidelines of sharee’ah. We must 
          also try to find out about anti-Islamic activities in the region. 
 
          17 – Strengthening ties with official religious bodies, 
          by holding friendly meetings, giving gifts of Islamic books and audio 
          materials, etc. This will make your work much easier for you and will 
          be more effective in spreading the message. 
 
          Finally, we ask Allaah to give you strength and make 
          you steadfast. Peace be upon you, and the mercy and blessings of Allaah.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

How can the believer save himself from this or avoid being harmed by it? Are there any du’as or dhikrs (supplications or words of remembrance) from the Quran or Sunnah (prophetic teachings) for these things?","There are different ways of getting rid of sihr, such as:
1- The sahir should be forced to undo what he has done
2- Reciting the Quran
3- Making du`a
4- Taking seven green lote leaves, grinding them up, and putting them into water, then reciting into it the verses and chapters mentioned below.",,"Praise be to Allah.There are different ways of getting rid of sihr (magic):

He can look at what the sahir (person who practices sihr/magic ) has done. For example, if he has put some of his hair in a place, or in a comb, or somewhere else, if it is discovered that he has put it in such-and-such a place, it should be removed and burnt or destroyed. This will cancel out what has been done and will foil the intentions of the sahir.
The sahir should be forced to undo what he has done, if his identity is known. It should be said to him, “Either you undo what you have done, or you will be executed.” After he has undone it, he should still be executed by the authorities, because the sahir should be killed without being asked to repent, according to the correct view. This is what was done by ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), and it was narrated that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The punishment of the sahir is to strike him with the sword (i.e., execute him).” When Hafsah Umm al-Muminin (may Allah be pleased with her) found out that a slave woman of hers was dealing with sihr, she killed her.
Reciting the Quran, for it has a great effect in removing (the effects of) sihr. Ayat al-Kursiy, the verses of sihr from Surat al-A’raf, Surat Yunus and Surat Ta-Ha, Surat al-Kafirun, Surat al-Ikhlas and al-Mu’awwidhatayn should be recited over the person who has been affected by sihr , or into a vessel. Du’a should be made for healing and good health; in particular the du’a which has been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him):

“Allahumma Rabb al-Nas, adhhib al-bas washfi, anta al-Shafiy, la shifa a illa shifa uka, shifa an la yughadiru saqaman (O Allah, Lord of mankind, remove the evil and grant healing, for You are the Healer. There is no healing except Your healing, which does not leave any sickness).”
One may also recite the words used by Jibril (peace be upon him) when he treated the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with ruqyah:
“Bismillah urqik, min kulli shay in yu dhik, wa min sharri kulli nafsin aw ‘aynin hasidin Allah yashfik, bismillah urqik (In the name of Allah I perform ruqyah for you, from everything that is harming you, from the evil of every soul or envious eye may Allah heal you, in the name of Allah I perform ruqyah for you).”
This should be repeated three times, as should the recitation of “Qul Huwa Allah Ahad ” and al-Mu’awwidhatayn.
He may also recite the above into water, some of which should be drunk by the person who has been affected by sihr, and he should wash with the rest, one or more times as needed. This will remove the sihr by Allah’s leave. This was mentioned by the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them), and by Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Hasan (may Allah have mercy on him) in Fath al-Majid Sharh Kitab al-Tawhid, in (the chapter entitled) Bab Ma ja a fi’l-Nushrah, and by others.

He can take seven green lote leaves, grind them up, and put them into water, then recite into it the verses and chapters mentioned above, and the du’as. Then he can drink some and wash with the rest. This is also useful for treating a man who is being kept from having intercourse with his wife. Seven green lote leaves should be placed in water, the verses referred to above should be recited into it, then he should drink from it and wash with it. This is beneficial, by Allah’s leave.

The verses which should be recited into the water and the lote leaves for those who have been affected by sihr and the one who is being prevented from having intercourse with his wife because of sihr are as follows:

Surat al-Fatihah
Ayat al-Kursiy from Surat al-Baqarah , which is as follows (interpretation of the meaning):

“Allah! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), Al-Hayyul-Qayyum (the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists). Neither slumber nor sleep overtakes Him. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His Permission? He knows what happens to them (His creatures) in this world, and what will happen to them in the Hereafter. And they will never encompass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills. His Kursiy extends over the heavens and the earth, and He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.” [Al-Baqarah 2:255]

The verses from Surat al-A’araf, which are as follows (interpretation of the meaning):

“[Pharaoh] said: ‘If you have come with a sign, show it forth, if you are one of those who tell the truth.’
Then [Musa] threw his stick and behold! it was a serpent, manifest!
And he drew out his hand, and behold! It was white (with radiance) for the beholders.
The chiefs of the people of Pharaoh said: ‘This is indeed a well-versed sorcerer;
He wants to get you out of your land, so what do you advise?’
They said: ‘Put him and his brother off (for a time), and send callers to the cities to collect —
That they bring to you all well-versed sorcerers.’
And so the sorcerers came to Pharaoh. They said: ‘Indeed there will be a (good) reward for us if we are the victors.’
He said: ‘Yes, and moreover you will (in that case) be of the nearest (to me).’
They said: ‘O Musa! Either you throw (first), or shall we have the (first) throw?’
He [Musa] said: ‘Throw you (first).’ So when they threw, they bewitched the eyes of the people, and struck terror into them, and they displayed a great magic.
And We revealed to Musa (saying): ‘Throw your stick,’ and behold! It swallowed up straight away all the falsehood which they showed.
Thus truth was confirmed, and all that they did was made of no effect.
So they were defeated there and returned disgraced.
And the sorcerers fell down prostrate.
They said: ‘We believe in the Lord of the ‘Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists).
The Lord of Musa and Harun.’”  [Al-A`raf 7:106-122]

The verses from Surat Yunus, which are as follows (interpretation of the meaning):

“And Pharaoh said: ‘Bring me every well-versed sorcerer.’
And when the sorcerers came, Musa said to them: ‘Cast down what you want to cast!’
Then when they had cast down, Musa said: ‘What you have brought is sorcery, Allah will surely make it of no effect. Verily, Allah does not set right the work of Al-Mufsidun (corrupters).
And Allah will establish and make apparent the truth by His Words, however much the Mujrimun (criminals) may hate (it).’” [Yunus 10:79-82]

The verses from Surat Ta-Ha, which are as follows (interpretation of the meaning):

“They said: ‘O Musa! Either you throw first or we be the first to throw?’
[Musa] said: ‘Nay, throw you (first)!’ Then behold! their ropes and their sticks, by their magic, appeared to him as though they moved fast.
So Musa conceived fear in himself.
We (Allah) said: ‘Fear not! Surely, you will have the upper hand.
And throw that which is in your right hand! It will swallow up that which they have made. That which they have made is only a magician’s trick, and the magician will never be successful, to whatever amount (of skill) he may attain’” [20:65-69]

Surat al-Kafirun
Surat al-Ikhlas and al-Mu’awwidhatayn (i.e., Surat al-Falaq and Surat al-Nas) – to be recited three times.
Reciting some of the du’as prescribed in shari’ah, such as:

“Allaahumma Rabb al-Nas, adhhib al-ba s wa’shfi, anta al-Shafiy, la shifa a illa shifa uka, shifa an la yughadiru saqaman (O Allah, Lord of mankind, remove the evil and grant healing, for You are the Healer. There is no healing except Your healing, which does not leave any sickness).”
If the above verses etc. are recited directly over the person who has been affected by sihr, then the reciter blows on his head and chest, these are also among the means of healing, by Allah’s leave, as stated above.

Zakah is also due on the profits of the shares in agricultural and dairy businesses and the like, if they reach the nisaab and one full (hijri) year has passed, if they are purely for investment.

12932,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12932,The truth about Shaykh al-Jilaani and Shaykh Ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab,"What do you think of Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jilani?

I have heard some really bad stories about Abdul Wahab and how he disgraced the religion of Islam? What is your opinion on this?",,,"Praise be to Allah.When speaking about people, what 
  we say must be based on knowledge and fairness. In the case of a man who has 
  achieved a great deal in the way of religion, we must acknowledge his achievements, 
  but that does not prevent us from pointing out his mistakes. This general principle 
  is to be applied when speaking of Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qaadir al-Jilaani and 
  other Muslim scholars. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qaadir (may 
  Allaah have mercy on him) is one of the imaams of Islam. He attained a position 
  of leadership over the Muslims of his time, in knowledge, good deeds, issuing 
  fatwas and other aspects of religion. He was one of the greatest shaykhs of 
  his time, enjoining adherence to the sharee’ah, enjoining what is good, 
  forbidding what is evil, and giving that precedence over all else. He was an 
  ascetic (zaahid) and a preacher, in whose gatherings many people repented. Allaah 
  caused him to be well-liked by people and his virtue became widely-known – 
  may Allaah bestow abundant mercy upon him. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qaadir was 
  a follower, not an innovator. He followed the way of the righteous salaf and 
  in his books he encouraged people to follow the salaf; he also enjoined that 
  upon his followers. He used to tell people not to follow innovations in religion, 
  and he stated clearly that he was opposed to the ahl al-kalaam (“Islamic 
  philosophers”) such as the Ash’aris and their ilk. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qaadir agreed 
  with Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah – the followers of truth 
  – concerning all issues of ‘aqeedah (belief), namely Tawheed, faith, 
  Prophethood, and the Last Day. 
There are some minor mistakes 
  and errors in his books, and some innovations which are relatively insignificant 
  when compared with his achievements. To find out more about them, along with 
  an explanation of where he went wrong, please see Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qaadir 
  al-Jilaani wa Araa’uhu al-I’tidaaqiyyah wa’l-Soofiyyah, 
  by Shaykh Dr. Sa’eed ibn Musfir al-Qahtaani, 440-476.
Moreover, it is not right to 
  make one Muslim scholar, let alone anyone else, the sole source of what is true 
  and correct, in the sense that one takes what he says as being true and what 
  goes against that as being false – not Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qaadir and 
  not anyone else. Rather the truth is that which is in accordance with the Qur’aan 
  and Sunnah, no matter who says it, and what goes against the Qur’aan and 
  Sunnah should be ignored and avoided, even if it is said by ‘Abd al-Qaadir 
  al-Jilaani, Maalik, al-Shaafa’i, Ahmad or anyone else. 
There is a point which we must 
  make here, which is that praising Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qaadir does not mean 
  praising everyone who claims to follow him. Not everyone who claims to follow 
  a shaykh or a tareeqah or anything else is to be believed. How often has it 
  happened that a person who is thought to be a true follower turned out to be 
  the farthest removed from what was thought to be the case? How many misleading 
  people don the cloak of asceticism and piety when they have nothing to do with 
  either of them? Hence the Sufi tareeqah which is known nowadays as the Qaadiriyyah 
  is not following the straight path which the Shaykh (may Allaah have mercy on 
  him) followed, rather it is a deviant Sufi tareeqah which has deviated from 
  the guidance of the Qur’aan and Sunnah; it exaggerates a great deal about 
  Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qaadir and even attributes to him things that can only 
  rightfully be attributed to Allaah. Some of them exaggerate concerning his grave, 
  seeking help from it, and some of them exaggerate about his attributes and miracles 
  (karaamah). 
By comparing the actions of those 
  who claim to follow the shaykh with what is narrated in the Qur’aan and 
  Sunnah, what was narrated from the righteous salaf and even what was narrated 
  from the Shaykh himself (may Allaah have mercy on him), we will clearly see 
  that there is a huge gap between the two, and that the Qaadiri group has deviated 
  from the path of its shaykh whom they claim to be following. That is because 
  they have introduced so many innovations (bid’ahs) into the religion of 
  Allaah, that the Shaykh would never have approved of. It has been narrated from 
  the respectable scholars that they regarded this group as extreme, for example 
  what was said by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
  in his refutation of al-Bakri concerning the issue of ziyaarah or visiting graves 
  (1/228), and in the fatwas of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem Aal al-Shaykh, indicates 
  that they have committed some actions of shirk. 
See: Fataawa Ibn Ibraaheem, 
  1/276, 109 
Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 
  2/250-252
Al-Durar al-Sunniyyah, 
  1/74 
With regard to the ‘Abd 
  al-Wahhaab mentioned in the question, perhaps what is meant is Shaykh Muhammad 
  ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allaah have mercy on him). If we want to know 
  more about him, we cannot find anyone who can describe the man better than himself, 
  because when there is a man concerning whom people’s opinions vary greatly, 
  with some praising him and some condemning him, we should look at what he says 
  in his writings and his books, and at what is correctly attributed to him, then 
  weigh that against the Qur’aan and Sunnah. What Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd 
  al-Wahhaab said, describing himself, was: “I tell you that– praise 
  be to Allaah – my belief and my religion, according to which I worship 
  Allaah, is the way of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah, which was the 
  way of the imaams of the Muslims, such as the four Imaams and their followers 
  until the Day of Resurrection. But I explain to people that they must devote 
  their worship sincerely to Allaah (ikhlaas). I forbid them to call upon the 
  Prophets and the dead among the righteous and others, and from associating them 
  with Allaah in any act of worship that should be done for Allaah alone, such 
  as offering sacrifices, making vows, putting one’s trust, prostrating 
  and other actions which are due to Allaah and in which no one should be associated 
  with Him, not any angel who is close to Him or any Prophet who was sent. This 
  is the Message which was proclaimed by all the Messengers, from the first of 
  them to the last of them, and this is the way of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah. 
  I hold a high position in my village and people listen to me. Some of the leaders 
  denounced that because it goes against the customs they grew up with. I also 
  obliged those who are under me to perform regular prayer, pay zakaah and fulfil 
  other Islamic duties, and I forbade them to deal with ribaa, drink intoxicants 
  and other kinds of forbidden things. The leaders could not criticize that or 
  find fault with it, because it is something that is liked by the common folk, 
  so they directed their criticism and enmity against that which I enjoin of Tawheed 
  and that which I forbid of shirk, and they confused the common folk by saying 
  that this goes against what everyone is doing, and they caused a great deal 
  of fitnah…” (al-Durar al-Sunniyyah, 1/64-65, 79-80)
 Any 
  fair-minded person who studies the books of this man will know that he is one 
  of those who call people to Allaah with sure knowledge, and that he bore many 
  difficulties and hardships in order to restore Islam to its pure form, when 
  it had been altered a great deal at his time, and that was because of his opposition 
  to the whims and desires of the leaders, who stirred up the ignorant masses 
  of the common people against him, so that they could continue to enjoy their 
  positions of worldly leadership and wealth. 
I urge you not to be easily influenced 
  by others with regard to what you listen to and believe. Rather you should be 
  a seeker of truth, defending it no matter who is promoting it, and I urge you 
  to avoid falsehood and error no matter who is promoting it. So if you look at 
  any of the books by this shaykh – and I recommend you to read Kitaab 
  al-Tawheed alladhi huwa haqq Allaah ‘ala al-‘Abeed [Kitaab 
  al-Tawheed is available in English translation] – you will find out 
  how great the Shaykh’s knowledge was, and how important his call is, and 
  the extent to which his words have been twisted and accusations have been made 
  against him. 
You can see some of the accusations 
  made against the Shaykh and find out the response to them by clicking on the 
  following link for information in English, 
  And this link will give you the information in Arabic: 
 More importantly, I urge 
  you to ponder the Qur’aan and Sunnah, to ask trustworthy scholars about 
  matters concerning which you are confused. Beware of those who follow their 
  whims and desires, and of shirk in all its forms. If you do that, then the question 
  of whether Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allaah have mercy 
  on him) was right or wrong becomes irrelevant. Moreover you should realize that 
  it is haraam to violate the honour and reputation of Muslims by saying things 
  about them in such a manner as to undermine their position, even if what is 
  said is true – so how about if it is false?  
May Allaah help us and you to 
  follow true guidance and the religion of truth, and to do that which pleases 
  Him.

12945,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12945,"Is it necessary to do two Tawaafs, one for the child and one for the person who is carrying him, or is one Tawaaf sufficient for both?","I have decided to do Hajj and I have a small child with me. Do I have to do Tawaaf for myself and then do another Tawaaf for him, or will one Tawaaf and one Sa’ee be sufficient?",,,"Praise be to Allah.In the name of Allaah, the most Gracious, 
  the most Merciful  
Answer: the scholars are agreed that the 
  Hajj of a child is valid. Abu Haneefah said: he is not subject to the obligations 
  of expiation. The scholars are agreed that this does not count as the obligatory 
  Hajj, and he must do another Hajj after he reaches adolescence.   
The Hajj of a child may be one of the following 
  three cases:  
1.        
  Where the child is able to walk, in which case he does Tawaaf and Saa’ee 
  on his own behalf. 
2.       
  Where he is not able to walk, but he has reached an age of understanding. 
  In this case both the one who is carrying him and the one who is carried (i.e., 
  the child) should have the intention on his own behalf, then one Tawaaf and 
  one Sa’ee will be sufficient for both of them. 
3.         
  Where the child is very young and has not reached an age of understanding. 
  In this case his guardian or someone else should carry him and make the intention 
  on his behalf. Then one Tawaaf and one Sa’ee will be sufficient for both 
  of them. Their case is similar to that of one who is riding.  
Some of the scholars said that he should 
  do Tawaaf on his own behalf then do another Tawaaf on behalf of the child. 
But the first view is the one which is correct. It was 
  narrated in Saheeh Muslim (1336) via Ibn ‘Uyaynah from Ibraaheem 
  ibn ‘Uqbah from Kareeb the mawla (freed slave) of Ibn ‘Abbaas 
  from Ibn ‘Abbaas that the Prophet  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) met a group of people in al-Rawhaa’, 
  and said, “Who are you?” They said, “Muslims.” They 
  said, “Who are you?” He said, “The Messenger of Allaah.” 
  A woman lifted up a small child and said, “Is Hajj counted for this one?” 
  He said, “Yes, and you will have the reward.”  
The Prophet  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not say, do two Tawaafs, one 
  on his behalf and one on your own behalf. It is not permissible to delay explaining 
  something at the time when it is needed.  
This is the view of Abu Haneefah and was favoured by Ibn 
  al-Mundhir. Abu Muhammad ibn Hazam (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Muhallaa 
  (5/320): “We regard it as mustahabb to take a child for Hajj even if he 
  is very young, or he  is old enough. This will count as Hajj for him and 
  he will have the reward, but it is a voluntary Hajj. The one who takes him for 
  Hajj will also have reward. He (the child) should avoid all the things that 
  the muhrim should avoid, but there is no penalty on him if he does anything 
  that is not allowed. He may be carried for Tawaaf and the Ramiy (throwing stones 
  at the Jamaraat) may be done on his behalf if he is not able to do it. The Tawaaf 
  of the one who takes him for Tawaaf will count as Tawaaf for both of them…”  
  
Because there is no difference between 
  this and the one who is riding. The Tawaaf counts for both the carrier and the 
  one who is carried. And Allaah knows best.  
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy 
  on him) said: If the carrier intends to do tawaaf and sa’ee both on his 
  own behalf and on behalf of the person who is being carried, that will count 
  for both of them, according to the more sound of the two opinions. Because the 
  Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
  be upon him) did not tell the woman who asked him about the child’s Hajj 
  to do another Tawaaf for him. If that had been obligatory, he  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have said so.  
See Majmoo’ Fataawa Shaykh ‘Abd 
  al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, 5/257   
Shaykh Ibn Jibreen was asked about that 
  and he said:  
The ihraam of a child is valid, but his guardian is responsible 
  for him. So he should dress him for ihraam and tie the ihraam garments on him, 
  and make intention for Hajj on his behalf, and recite Talbiyah on his behalf, 
  then he should hold his hand during Tawaaf and Sa’ee. If he is incapable 
  of doing that, as in the case of a very small child or nursing infant, then 
  there is nothing wrong with him carrying him. One Tawaaf is sufficient for both 
  the carrier and the one who is carried, according to the correct view…
