I work in a telecommunications company and I have a colleague who works with me. We have full control over the money that is paid in by customers. My colleague always takes a share of the money and says that we have the right to do that, on the grounds that the owner of the company does not give us our full rights. The salary that we are given is according to the conditions upon which we accepted the job. 
And we do something else too: if one of the customers is one of our acquaintances, we give him a discount. 
Please help me, because I tried to advise my colleague but he is convinced that what he is doing is permissible.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah has commanded us to fulfil our trusts properly, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, Allaah commands that you should render back the trusts to those, to whom they are due” [al-Nisa’ 4:58]
And the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) described betraying the ummah as one of the signs of hypocrisy, Allaah forbid. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The signs of the hypocrite are three: when he speaks he lies, when he makes a promise he breaks it, and when he is entrusted with something he betrays (that trust).” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 33; Muslim, 59. 
With regard to this prohibition, it makes no difference if a Muslim betrays the trust of a fellow-Muslim or of a kaafir who has entrusted his wealth or property to him. Rather it is by being honest and trustworthy that he can give a good example of Muslims. Many nations entered Islam because of the trustworthiness and honesty of the Muslim traders. Conversely, if a Muslim is treacherous or tells lies, this puts people off Islam and turns them away from the path of Allaah.  
Al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
If a Muslim enters daar al-harb (non-Muslim lands) in safety and gains some control over any of their wealth, it is not permissible for him to take anything of it, great or small, because if they have granted him safety then they are entitled to the same from him, and because it is not permissible for him to take anything from them when he is under their protection except that which he would be permitted to take from the wealth of the Muslims or of ahl al-dhimmah (non-Muslims living under Muslim protection). Al-Umm, 4/284. 
Because you have agreed upon a specific salary with the company, it is not permissible for you to take anything extra without the knowledge of the company owner. The claim that they are not giving you what you deserve is no excuse. If you open this door, then every worker will make similar claims and rights and trusts will be lost. 
Similarly it is not permissible for you to give discounts to anyone or to waive the price altogether. This money is not yours to do that with. You have to take the price in full no matter who the customers are. 
So what you both have to do is to repent to Allaah by giving up what you are doing, regretting it and resolving not to do it again. You also have to give back to the company what belongs to it, namely whatever you took in addition to your salary and the discounts that you allowed to your acquaintances and friends.

32534,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/32534,How could the Islamic states allow the development of riba-based banks?,"I have read many fatwas which forbid dealing with banks that engage in riba, but I have a question: If these banks are haraam and dealing with them is haraam, how can they have been allowed to develop in the Islamic states?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.What is haraam is that which has been 
    forbidden by Allaah and His Messenger, and what is halaal is that which has been permitted by Allaah and His Messenger. 
Riba is haraam according to the Qur’aan, the 
    Sunnah and the consensus of the ummah. Every institution or bank which is based on riba is subject to the declaration of war from Allaah and His 
    Messenger, whether it is in a Muslim state or a kaafir state. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Be afraid of Allaah and give up what remains (due to you) from Ribaa (from 
    now onward) if you are (really) believers.
 And if you do not do it, then take a 
    notice of war from Allaah and His Messenger”
[al-Baqarah 2:278-279]
The fact that governments approve of the 
    riba-based banks should not be taken as proof that these banks are permitted. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has 
    told us that there will come a time when the people will permit that which Allaah has forbidden, such as adultery, alcohol and musical 
    instruments. That does not mean that these haraam things will become permissible thereby. 
The scholars have issued many warnings against these banks, and issued many fatwas stating 
    that it is haraam to work in them without paying any attention to the fact that they are allowed by the state. They have often advised the 
    governments of Muslim countries to ban these riba-based banks. 
It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah 
    (15/51): 
“Riba is haraam according to the Qur’aan, the 
    Sunnah and scholarly consensus… working in banks that deal with riba is haraam… The fact that the government may approve of them or allow them to 
    open banks or remains silent about that does not mean that it is permissible for the Muslim to deal with them. It is not permissible to work in 
    these banks because the government does not possess legislative authority; rather legislative authority belongs to Allaah alone in His holy Book, 
    or the Revelation that He sent to His Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).” 
And it also says (15/55): 
“Working in banks that deal with riba is 
    haraam, whether that is in a Muslim state or in a kaafir state, because it involves cooperating in sin and transgression, which Allaah has 
    forbidden as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Help you one another in Al‑Birr and 
    At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression”
[al-Maa'idah 5:2]
Shaykh Ibn Baaz said, after quoting some of the evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnah that riba 
    is haraam: 
“This is some of the evidence from the Book 
    of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) which explains that riba is haraam and the danger that 
    it poses to the individual and to the ummah. Whoever deals in it enters into a state of war against Allaah and His Messenger. My advice to every 
    Muslim is to be content with that which Allaah and His Messenger have permitted and to refrain from that which Allaah and His Messenger have 
    forbidden. What Allaah has permitted is sufficient so that we have no need of that which Allaah has forbidden. We should not be deceived by the 
    large number of riba-based banks and the spread of their dealings in every place. Many people no longer care about Islamic rulings, rather they 
    care about making money by any means. That is only because of their weakness of faith and lack of fear of Allaah, and because of their love for 
    this world. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound.”

    What is prescribed when a child is born is for the family to

    originally a Pharaonic custom which was observed by the Pharaohs before

    It is a reprehensible innovation (bid’ah) for which there is no basis in 
    Islam. It is rejected by the hadeeth of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Whoever innovates anything in this matter 
    of ours that is not part of it will have it rejected.” Saheeh – agreed 
    upon. 

    The Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon

    matters, for every newly-invented matter is an innovation and every 
    innovation is a going astray.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4607; classed as 
    saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. Al-Nasaa’i (1578) added: “And every going astray will be in Hellfire.”

32577,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/32577,When to Pray Witr?,When does the time of Witr end? Should I deliberately delay it until the time of Fajr?,"The time for Witr prayer lasts from after `Isha’ prayer until dawn begins. Once dawn begins, the time for Witr is over, based on the words of the Prophet: “Pray Witr before morning comes.”",,"Praise be to Allah.The time for Witr prayer lasts from after `Isha’ prayer until dawn begins. 
Once dawn begins, the time for Witr is over, based on the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Pray Witr before morning comes.” (Narrated by Muslim, 754) 
Muslim also narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Hasten to pray Witr before dawn.” 
Also, Muslim narrated (752) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Witr is one Rak`ah at the end of the night.” 
At-Tirmidhi narrated (469) from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When dawn comes, all the night prayers and Witr are over, so pray Witr before dawn comes.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albaani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi) 
Al-Bukhari (472) and Muslim (749) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The night prayers are two (Rak`ahs) by two, then when you think that morning (dawn) is about to begin, pray one (Rak`ah) and it will make what you have prayed Witr (odd-numbered).” 
Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“This indicates that the time for Witr ends when dawn comes, because it is a prayer with which the night prayers are concluded, so it cannot be done after the night has ended.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, 14/115)
Some of the scholars are of the view that the time for Witr lasts after dawn comes , until one has prayed Fajr, and they quoted as evidence the report narrated about some of the Companions, that they prayed Witr after dawn had come and before the iqamah was said for Fajr prayer. 
Ibn Rushd Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“With regard to the time for Witr, the scholars unanimously agreed that the time for it is from after `Isha prayer until dawn begins, because that was narrated through numerous Isnads (chains of narration) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). One of the strongest such reports is that narrated by Muslim from Abu Nadrah Al-‘Awfi (may Allah have mercy on him), which says that Abu Sa`id (may Allah be pleased with him) told them that they asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about Witr and he said: “Witr comes before dawn.” They differed as to whether it is permissible to pray it after dawn. Some of them said it is not allowed, and others said that it is allowed so long as one has not yet prayed Fajr. The first view was expressed by Abu Yusuf and Muhammad ibn Al-Hasan, two companions of Abu Hanifah, and Sufyan Ath-Thawri  (may Allah have mercy on them), and the second was expressed by Ash-Shaafa’i, Malik and Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on them). The reason for their difference of opinion was the actions of some of the Companions which differed from what is mentioned in the reports.  
My view concerning this matter is that what they did does not contradict the reports that have been narrated concerning that – I mean the reports which say that they allowed praying Witr after dawn . Rather they allowed it in cases where it needs to be made up, not as a regular practice. Their view would only contradict the reports if they said that this prayer could be offered after dawn on a regular basis. Think about it.” (Bidayat Al-Mujtahid, 1/147, 148)
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“There are many Hadiths on this topic, which indicate that the time for Witr ends when dawn begins.” (Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 11/306)

He is religiously-committed and of good character, and he comes from a rsespectable family, as her own family have attested, because they know him from before. My friend was astonished when her father and mother refused this man, even though they praised his religious-commitment and good character. The reason they gave for their refusal was that he is not from their tribe, and it is a shame for them to let their daughter marry someone who is not from their tribe. My friend tried every way to convince them, but without success. She asked some people to speak to her father and two of her male cousins went and asked about the man and found out that he is good, and they went to her father (to convince him to let her marry him), but without success. She tried to remind her father that she is getting too old and has few chances of marriage, and she told him that Allaah would punish him, but without success, because he is under the thumb of the mother who does not want her to get married, not because of tradition or custom, but because she wants her to find a job as a teacher so she can take her salary. This is the problem. My question is, should this girl go to the court so that the qaadi will marry her to this young man? Will that take a long time before the marriage is done, i.e., will the qaadi summon her father and will there be lengthy procedures? This makes her afraid because if she goes to the court the first time and the judge makes an appointment for the hearing on another day, her family may prevent her from attending and the matter may be decided without her being present. Please advise us on this matter, may Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Parents’ insisting on marrying their daughters to men from the same tribe, even if 
    that means delaying their marriage, is a serious wrongdoing and a betrayal of the trust which Allaah has given to them. 
The evil consequences which come from denying women the opportunity to get 
    married, or delaying it, are known only to Allaah. Anyone who looks at the state of society will see that clearly. 
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) referred to these 
    evil consequences when he said: “If there comes to you (to propose marriage to your daughter) one with whose religious commitment and character 
    you are pleased, then marry (your daughter) to him, for if you do not do that, there will be fitnah (tribulation) on earth and widespread 
    corruption.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1084, from Abu Haatim al-Muzani. This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
If a man prevents a female relative under his guardianship from marrying a man who 
    is compatible and who is religiously-committed and of good character, then guardianship passes from him to the next (relative) in line. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Preventing a woman from 
    marrying means preventing a woman from marrying a compatible man if she wants to get married and if each of them wants to marry the other. Ma’qil 
    ibn Yassaar said: I married a sister of mine to a man, then he divorced her. When her ‘iddah ended, he came to propose marriage to her again. I 
    said to him, ‘I married her to you, I was kind and I honoured you, then you divorced her, and now you come proposing marriage again! No, by 
    Allaah, she will never go back to you.’ There was nothing wrong with the man, and she wanted to go back to him. Then Allaah revealed the words 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘do not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands, if they mutually 
    agree on reasonable basis’
[al-Baqarah 2:232]
I said, ‘Now I will do that O Messenger of Allaah.’ So he married her to him. Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari. 
It is the same whether she asks for marriage with a mahr like that of a woman of 
    equal standing to her, or with less. This is the view of al-Shaafa’i. 
If she wants to marry someone of equal standing, and the wali wants to marry her 
    to a different person of equal standing, and he refuses to marry her to the person whom she wants to marry, then he is preventing her from 
    marrying. 
But if she wants to marry someone of different standing, then he has the right to stop her, and 
    in this case he is not preventing her from marrying in the wrongful sense. 
Al-Mughni, 9/383 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “When a woman 
    reaches the age of puberty, if there comes to you one with whose religious commitment and character she is pleased and who is compatible, and the 
    wali does not have any proof that he is not compatible, then the wali has to respond to his request and marry her to him. If he refuses to do so, 
    then his responsibilities towards his charge should be pointed out to him. If he still insists on refusing after that, then he forfeits the right 
    of guardianship and it passes to the next closest relative on the father’s side.” 
From the Shaykh’s Fataawa, 10/97. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
If the wali refused to let a woman marry a man whose religious commitment and 
    character are good, then guardianship passes to the next closest male relative on the father’s side, then the next closest and so on. If they 
    refuse to arrange her marriage, as usually happens, then guardianship passes to the qaadi, and the qaadi should arrange the woman’s marriage. If 
    the matter is referred to him and he knows that her guardians have refused to arrange her marriage, then he should do that, because he is the wali 
    in cases where there is no specific wali.  
The fuqaha’ (may Allaah have mercy on them) stated that if the wali repeatedly 
    refuses marriage proposals from suitable men, then he is a faasiq (evildoer) and is no longer regarded as being of good character or as being a 
    wali, rather according to the best known view of the madhhab of Imam Ahmad, he also forfeits the right to lead prayers and it is not valid to 
    offer any congregational prayer behind him. This is a serious matter. 
Some people, as we have referred to above, refuse offers of marriage from 
    compatible men, but the girl may feel too shy to come to the qaadi to ask for her marriage to be arranged. This is something that does happen. But 
    she should weigh the pros and cons, and decide which has the more damaging consequences, staying without a husband and letting her wali control 
    her life according to his mood or his whims and desires, and when she grows old and no longer wants to get married, then he will arrange her 
    marriage, or going to the qaadi and asking him to arrange her marriage because that is her right according to sharee’ah. 
Undoubtedly the second alternative is preferable, which is that she should go to 
    the qaadi and ask him to arrange her marriage, because she has the right to that, and because her going to the qaadi and his arranging her 
    marriage serves the interests of others too, because others will come just as she has, and her coming to the qaadi will serve as a deterrent to 
    those who wrong those whom Allaah has put under their care and prevent them from marrying compatible men. In other words, this serves three 
    purposes: 
1.The woman’s own interests, so that she will not stay without a husband.
2.The interests of others, because it will open the door for women who are waiting for someone to set a 
    precedent they can follow.
3.Preventing those oppressive walis who make decisions for their daughters or other women under their 
    guardianship according to their own moods or what they themselves want.
This also serves the purpose of establishing the command of the Messenger  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who said: “If there comes to you (to propose marriage to your daughter) one with whose religious 
    commitment and character you are pleased, then marry (your daughter) to him, for if you do not do that, there will be fitnah (tribulation) on 
    earth and widespread corruption.”   
It also serves a specific interest, which is arranging marriages for those who are 
    suitable in terms of religious commitment and character, thus protecting them from going astray and falling into haraam. 
Quoted from Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/148. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen also said: 
Would that we could reach a level where a woman can dare, if her father refuses to let her 
    marry one who is suitable in terms of religious commitment and character, to go to the qaadi and he could say, “Arrange her marriage or I will do 
    it, or a guardian other than you will do it.” Because this is the girl’s right, if her father refuses to arrange her marriage (it is her right to 
    complain to the qaadi). This is her right according to sharee’ah. Would that we could reach this level, but shyness keeps most girls from doing 
    that.
See also question no, 10196 
The one who has most right to arrange a woman’s marriage is her father, then his 
    father, (and grandfathers) no matter how far the line of ascent extends; then her son and grandson, no matter how far the line of descent extends; 
    then her brothers through her father and her mother; then her brother through her father only; then their sons, no matter how far the line of 
    descent extends; then her paternal uncles; then their sons, no matter how far the line of descent extends; then the father’s paternal uncles; then 
    the ruler. 
Al-Mughni, 9/355 
We do not know whether the court procedures will take a long time or not. You could always 
    alert the qaadi to the fact that the father may prevent his daughter from attending the court in the future. We ask Allaah to make things easy for 
    you and to give you a way out from your difficulty.

Outside of prayer, it is better for a person to do that which will increase his khushoo’ (humility, focus). If his khushoo’ will be increased by reciting from memory, then that is better; if his khushoo’ will be increased by reading from the Mus-haf, then that is better. If it is the same in either case, then reading from the Mus-haf is better, because it combines reading and looking, and his eyes will be protected from looking at things that may distract him from reciting and pondering the meaning. 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Adhkaar (p. 90-91): 
Reading Quran from the Mus-haf is better than reciting from memory; this is the view of our companions and it is well known from the salaf (may Allah be pleased with them). This does not apply in all cases however; if the reader can focus and ponder the meanings more when reciting from memory than when reading from the Mus-haf, then reciting from memory is better. If it is the same in both cases, then reading from the Mus-haf is better. This is what the salaf meant.

“Looking at the Mus-haf is an act of worship; for a child to look at his parents is an act of worship; looking at ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib is an act of worship.” This is a fabricated (mawdoo’) hadith, as al-Albaani said in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah, 1/531. 
“Give your eyes their share of worship: looking at the Mus-haf, thinking about it and pondering its wonders.” This is also fabricated (mawdoo’). Al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah, 4/88. 
“Five things are acts of worship: eating little, sitting in the mosque, looking at the Ka’bah, looking at the Mus-haf and looking at the face of a scholar.” This is a very weak (da’eef jiddan) hadith. Da’eef al-Jaami’ al-Sagheer, no. 2855.
