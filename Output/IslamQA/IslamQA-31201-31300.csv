31216,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/31216,The evil eye may be given by the kaafirs,Can the disbelievers give you evil eye?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, the evil eye may be given by a kaafir. The evidence for that is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
 “And verily, those who disbelieve would almost make you slip with their eyes (through hatred) when they hear the Reminder (the Quran)…” [al-Qalam 68:51]
 Al-Saddi said: “[This means] they would harm you with their eyes (evil eye).” Tafseer al-Baghawi, 8/202.
 This is also indicated by the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “The (evil) eye is real.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5740; Muslim, 2187.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
31217,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/31217,Can she use things that her father takes from work unlawfully?,"My problem is that my father works for one of the airline companies and sometimes he brings things home with him, either from the airplanes or from the airport. I tell him that this is not permissible and that it is haraam, and I say, “This doesn’t belong to you,” but he does not listen to my advice, even though he is religiously committed or he appears outwardly to be committed. I am trying to make him inwardly committed too, but he does not respond to me. I think that he does not accept that from me because I am his daughter and I am confused about the things that he brings home and I do not use them. But sometimes I am forced to use them because he does not buy them from the market, on the grounds that we already have them, but they are from a haraam source. What is the ruling on these things? If I use them unwillingly or because I am forced to, what is the ruling?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Your question covers two issues: 

    1 – Your father taking things that belong to 
    his work without permission. 

    2 – Your using this property that your 
    father has brought home. 

    1 – With regard to your father, it is haraam 
    for him to take something without the permission of its owner, because 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And eat up not one another’s property 
    unjustly (in any illegal way, e.g. stealing, robbing, deceiving)”

    [al-Baqarah 2:188]

    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for you to take the 
    property of a Muslim except with his consent.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 201172). 
    On this basis, you have to advise your father to return these things to 
    their owner; he will be a sinner unless he does that. If he does not know 
    who the owner is, then he should give them in charity. 

    2 – With regard to other members of the 
    household apart from your father, it is not permissible for them to use 
    these things, because they have been taken unlawfully, except in cases of necessity where a person fears that he will miss out on some benefitor he fears losing a limb or his life. In this case it is permitted but only as much as is necessary.","Shaykh Khaalid ibn ‘Ali al-Mushayqih – Assistant Professor at Imaam Muhammad ibn Sa’ood University, al-Qaseem"
31230,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/31230,There is nothing wrong with laser surgery on the eye to correct weak vision,Is Laser surgery for correction of eyesight weakness forbidden so that one does not have to wear glasses.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Doing laser surgery to correct weak vision is permissible. 
    And there is nothing wrong with doing it if it is done by an expert and it 
    is thought that the surgery will most likely be successful and will not 
    result in harm or complications that will make the situation worse than 
    before, because Islam forbids doing harm to oneself or to others, as the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “There should 
    be neither harming nor reciprocating harm.” Sharee’ah does not prevent the 
    Muslim from doing things that will benefit him and enhance his physical 
    faculties using permissible means. Laser surgery is not changing the 
    creation of Allaah. We ask Allaah to keep us, our religious commitment, our 
    health, our children and our wealth safe and sound.

31234,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/31234,He bought things and has not paid for them,"My husband bought some things from some of the kuffaar using a credit card, and he had not paid for them. Is this stealing?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Undoubtedly a person who buys something then does not pay for 
    it is stealing it, and stealing is a major sin, for which the Lawgiver has 
    stipulated the hadd punishment of cutting off the right hand: 

    “And (as for) the male thief and the female thief, cut off 
    (from the wrist joint) their (right) hands as a recompense for that which 
    they committed, a punishment by way of example from Allaah”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:38 – interpretation of the meaning]

    The one who does this must also give back to people what is 
    rightfully theirs. Whoever does not this is exposing himself to punishment 
    and disgrace. 

    It was narrated that Abu Humayd al-Saa’idi said: The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “By Allaah, none of you takes something that is not rightfully his but he 
    will meet Allaah carrying it on the Day of Resurrection. I shall certainly 
    recognize some of you coming to meet Allaah carrying a camel bellowing, or a 
    cow mooing, or a sheep bleating.” Then he raised his hand so high that I 
    could see the whiteness of his armpit and said, “O Allaah, have I conveyed 
    (the message)?” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6578; Muslim, 1832). 

    This person can return the property to its owner in whatever 
    way he sees fit, without exposing his identity to him. If the person from 
    whom it was stolen is in a place that he cannot reach, or he does not know 
    who he is, then he has to give the value of the item in charity on behalf of 
    its owner. If he knows the person then he may give him the choice between 
    his accepting the fact that he gave charity on his behalf or taking what is 
    rightfully his. If he chooses the charity option, he will have the reward of 
    that, otherwise he (the thief) must give him what is rightfully his, and the 
    (reward for) charity will go to the one who has repented, if his repentance 
    is sincere. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    If you have stolen from a person or from an organization, 
    then you have to contact the person from whom you stole, and tell him “I 
    have such and such that belongs to you.” Then you have to come to an 
    agreement. But a person may feel that this is too difficult and that he 
    cannot go to a person and say – for example – “I stole such and such from 
    you and I took such and such from you.” In this case, he can make sure that 
    this money – for example – reaches him in another, indirect, manner. For 
    example, he could give it to one of the person’s friends, tell him the story 
    and say, “I have now repented to Allaah and I hope that you will give it to 
    him.” 

    If he does that, then Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He 
    will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty)”

    [al-Talaaq 65:2] 

    “and whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He 
    will make his matter easy for him”

    [al-Talaaq 65:4]

    If we assume that you have stolen from someone and you do not 
    know who he is or where he is, then this is easier, because you can give in 
    charity an amount equal to what you stole, with the intention that the 
    reward be for the owner (of the stolen goods). In that case you will have 
    discharged your duty. 

    The story told by the questioner shows that a person must 
    keep away from such things, because he may steal in a moment of ignorance 
    and foolishness, and not get caught, but then if Allaah blesses him with 
    guidance, he will have a hard time ridding himself of that. 

    Fataawa Islamiyyah, 4/162 

    The scholars of the Standing Committee said, concerning a 
    soldier who stole from a person: 

    If he knows who the person is or knows someone who knows him, 
    then he has to look for him and give him his silver coins, or the 
    equivalent, or whatever he agrees upon with him. But if he does not know who 
    he is, or he thinks that he will never find him, then he should give an 
    equivalent amount of money in charity on behalf of the owner. Then if he 
    finds him after that, he should tell him what he has done. If he accepts 
    what he has done (giving charity), all well and good; and if does not accept 
    what he did and asks him for his money, he should give it to him, and the 
    (reward for) the charity will then be his. And he must ask Allaah for 
    forgiveness and repent to him, and make du’aa’ for the owner.

    And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
31242,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/31242,Is it permissible to employ a non-Muslim servant?,"1.Can a Muslim has a christian servant(menial) as a washerman, cleaner & cook etc?
2.If yes, what Islam says about a christian servant?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for a Muslim to employ a kaafir servant subject to certain conditions which include the following: 
He should not introduce anything impure (naajis) into the food or clothing of the Muslim. 
He should not cook for him anything that Muslims are forbidden to eat, such as pork. 
Employing this servant should not cause any fitnah (temptation) with regard to matters of religion, such as admiring Christianity or the Muslim children being influenced by the rituals of kufr which this servant may practise. 
There should be no risk of being tempted by him or her, or of committing haraam actions with him or her, as may happen if the female Christian servant is uncovered in front of the Muslim head of the household or his sons, or the Muslim wife of the head of the household may be tempted by a servant or driver. 
Such a servant should not be employed in the Arabian Peninsula where it is haraam for the kuffaar to settle. 
The servant should not be mistreated or his rights denied; one of the bad consequences of that is that it puts him off Islam. 
The Muslim must strive to employ Muslims because they are less evil, in general, than the kuffaar, and less likely to commit haraam actions that go against sharee’ah or to make others commit them. If a Muslim does have a kaafir servant, he should strive to call him to Islam and to guide him. 
The evidence that it is permissible to employ a trustworthy kaafir servant and call him to Islam is the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari (1356) from Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: “A Jewish boy used to serve the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he fell sick. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went and visited him. He sat by his head and said, ‘Enter Islam.’ The boy looked at his father, who was present. (His father) said, ‘Obey Abu’l-Qaasim (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).’ So he entered Islam and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) left saying, ‘Praise be to Allaah Who has saved him from the Fire.’”
