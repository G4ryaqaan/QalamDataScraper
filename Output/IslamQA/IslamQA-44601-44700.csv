44615,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/44615,He said that he committed zina with a woman but he was lying,"I am suffering deep torment because of a sin that I committed in the past, and I do not know how to rid myself of it. My life has been turned into hell because of this thing. 

Five years ago I was living in a religious vacuum, and I was far away from Allaah. I have a cousin who was the only friend I had in the whole world. 
One day the Shaytaan tricked me, and I told my cousin that I had an illicit relationship with some girls, but in fact I had no relationship at all with them. 

I do not know the punishment for this sin. 

Unfortunately I thought that manhood meant having relationships with women as many young men think nowadays. 

No one knows about this and news of it did not reach those women. 

In Ramadaan last year I repented to Allaah. I had a relationship with some women by phone and internet, so I told them that I had repented and severed my ties with them. 

I felt the sweetness of faith that I had never felt before. 

But I still remember the sin that I committed several years ago. It has to do with people’s honour. I prayed istikhaarah and thought about it a great deal, and I am still hesitant. Should I tell my friend that I lied to him so as to prove to him that these women are innocent of what I said about them, in which case I will lose my only friend when he sees that I lied to him? Or should I keep quiet and not say anything, but I fear Allaah’s punishment for this sin, so what should I do?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We ask Allaah to forgive your sin and to 
    conceal your fault, and to help you avoid temptations both obvious and 
    hidden. With regard to your question, it can be answered in the following 
    points: 
1 – It seems from your question that the one 
    whom you accused of committing forbidden actions is a specific woman whom 
    you and your cousin know. If it is a specific, known, woman, then this is 
    slander by you against her, which is a major sin and an abhorrent forbidden 
    action, because it is a slander against her honour and a transgression of 
    the limits set by Allaah. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said, as was narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him): “Avoid the seven sins that doom one to Hell.” They said: “O Messenger 
    of Allaah, what are they?” He said: “Associating others with Allaah (shirk), 
    witchcraft, killing a soul whom Allaah has forbidden us to kill, except when 
    it is lawful, consuming riba, consuming the orphan’s wealth, running away 
    from the battlefield, and slandering chaste believing women who never even 
    think of anything touching their chastity (cf. al-Noor 24:23).” Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, no. 2615; Muslim, 89. 
As well as slandering that woman, you are 
    also saying that you yourself committed zina, even if you are lying. 
But if it is not a specific women, for 
    example you said, “I did such and such with a woman,” and did not refer to a 
    specific woman, then this is not regarded as slandering anyone, but you are 
    still saying that you committed zina for which a hadd punishment is 
    deserved, so you have to clear your own name.  
It says in Badaa’i’ al-Sanaa’i’: If a 
    person says, “I committed zina with a woman, but I do not know who she 
    was,”, his confession is valid and he should be punished. Badaa’i’ 
    al-Sanaa’i’, 7/51 
2 – If it is a specific woman, but you have 
    repented and regret what you did, part of your repentance is to tell others 
    that you were lying, so you have to tell your cousin that you were not 
    telling the truth, because you have to clear the name of that chaste woman. 
    It is not permissible for you to give precedence to the friendship with your 
    cousin by slandering the honour of a Muslim woman. 
Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni: 
The apparent meaning of Ahmad’s words 
    is that the repentance of the slanderer is to state that he was lying. So he 
    should say, “I was lying when I said that.” This is the view of al-Shaafa’i. 
    Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: Those who said that also include Sa’eed ibn 
    al-Musayyib, ‘Ata’, Tawoos, al-Shu’bi, Ishaaq, Abu ‘Ubayd and Abu Thawr.
‘Abd al-Razzaaq narrated in al-Musannaf 
    (5/77) that Tawoos said: His repentance (i.e., the one who accused someone 
    of zina) is to say that he was lying. 
3 – You should note that the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever seeks the 
    pleasure of Allaah by angering people, Allaah will suffice him against 
    people, but whoever seeks to please people by angering Allaah, Allaah will 
    leave him to the people.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, no. 2414; classed as 
    saheeh by al-Albaani.
This hadeeth indicates that what you fear of 
    a bad relationship between you and your cousin is an insignificant matter. 
    Whoever obeys Allaah and seeks to please Him, Allaah will suffice him 
    against people. So you should care more about your relationship with your 
    Lord than your relationship with your cousin. Remember that this is one of 
    the trials with which Allaah tests you, so do what is right and put your 
    trust in Allaah, and do not fear the blame of anyone. Pray a great deal for 
    forgiveness, repent and make du’aa’ to Allaah, asking him to make you 
    steadfast in speaking the truth, and to reconcile you and your cousin, for 
    the hearts of men are between two of the fingers of the Most Merciful, and 
    He turns them however He wills. And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
44633,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/44633,Does Vomiting Invalidate Wudu?,Does vomiting invalidate wudu?,Imam al-Shafi`i was of the view that vomiting does not break wudu and this is the correct view because there is no sound evidence to show that vomiting breaks wudu.,"Does vomiting break wudu?


Does whatever comes out of anything other than the front and back passages break wudu?","Praise be to Allah.Does vomiting break wudu?
Some scholars are of the view that vomiting does invalidate wudu, such as Imam Abu Hanifah and Imam Ahmad. But Ahmad stipulated that vomiting does invalidate wudu if there is a large amount of vomit. 
Imam al-Shafi`i was of the view that vomiting does not invalidate wudu, and this is the correct view, because there is no sound evidence to show that vomiting invalidates wudu. (See: al-Majmu’, 2/63-65; al-Mughni, 1/247-250) 
Does whatever comes out of anything other than the front and back passages break wudu?
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Does whatever comes out of anything other than the  invalidate wudu? 
He replied: 
“What comes out of anything other than the front and back passages does not invalidate wudu , whether it is a little or a lot, except urine and stools. That is because the basic principle is that it does not invalidate wudu. Whoever claims something that is contrary to the basic principle has to provide evidence, but it is proven that man is tahir by the shar’i evidence, and whatever is proven by the shar’i evidence cannot be altered except by further shar’i evidence. We do not go beyond what is indicated by the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), because we submit to the laws of Allah, not to our whims and desires. So there is no justification for making people purify themselves when it is not essential and we do not waive from them a purification that is obligatory.
If someone were to say that it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) vomited then did wudu, we say: this hadith has been classed as da’if by most of the scholars. Then we say that this is simply an action, and the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) simply did an action does not indicate that it is obligatory, because there is no clear instruction. Moreover it is contradicted by another hadith – even if it is da’if – which says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was treated with cupping then he prayed and did not do wudu. This indicates that it is not obligatory to do wudu after vomiting. 
This is the correct view, that whatever comes out from the body does not invalidate wudu even if it is a lot, whether it is vomit, saliva, blood , pus or anything else, unless it is urine or stools, such as if an opening is made in the body to let them out, in which case wudu is invalidated when they come out from that opening.” (Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 11/198)

44679,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/44679,She vowed to do Hajj but she has not done the obligatory Hajj,"A woman vowed that if Allaah blessed her with a child, she would go for Hajj. Allaah has blessed her with a child, but does she have to do Hajj in fulfilment of this vow, knowing that she has not yet done the obligatory Hajj?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It should be noted that vows are not allowed. The Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade them when he said: 
    “They do not bring any good.” Hence some of the scholars are of the view 
    that vows are haraam. Why should you make a vow? Why should you burden 
    yourself? Will Allaah not heal you or your relative unless you stipulate 
    conditions for Him? Subhaan Allaah! Do not make vows, rather ask Allaah for 
    healing. If Allaah wants to heal him, He will heal him whether you make a 
    vow or not. If you do that and you make a vow, if it is a vow to do an act 
    of worship then you are obliged to fulfil it, because the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever vows to obey 
    Allaah, let him obey Him.” 

    Based on this, we say to the woman mentioned in the question: 
    You have to go for Hajj, but start with the obligatory Hajj, then do the 
    Hajj that you vowed to do, because it is obligatory for you, and if you do 
    not do it you are exposing yourself to a grave punishment which Allaah 
    mentioned in the verses where He says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And of them are some who made a covenant with Allaah 
    (saying): ‘If He bestowed on us of His Bounty, we will verily, give Sadaqah 
    (Zakaah and voluntary charity in Allaah’s Cause) and will be certainly among 
    those who are righteous.’

    76. Then when He gave them of His Bounty, they became 
    niggardly [refused to pay the Sadaqah (Zakaah or voluntary charity)], and 
    turned away, averse.

    77. So He punished them by putting hypocrisy into their 
    hearts till the Day whereon they shall meet Him, because they broke that 
    (covenant with Allaah) which they had promised to Him and because they used 
    to tell lies”

    [al-Tawbah 9:75-77].

    They vowed that if Allaah made them rich, they would give in 
    charity and would be righteous. Allaah gave them that, but they were stingy 
    with the money and turned away from righteousness. “So He punished them 
    by putting hypocrisy into their hearts” – until when? “till the Day 
    whereon they shall meet Him” i.e., until death. “because they broke 
    that (covenant with Allaah) which they had promised to Him and because they 
    used to tell lies.” 

    In conclusion: beware of making vows, and if you do not make 
    vows you will be fine. Do not oblige yourselves to do things that Allaah has 
    not obliged you to do except as the result of your own actions. If a person 
    has a sick loved one, let him say, “O Allaah, heal him.” If he wants to sit 
    an exam, let him say, “O Allaah, grant me success,” because some students, 
    when they find their studies hard and are afraid that they will fail, 
    promise Allaah that they will do various acts of worship if they pass the 
    exams. Then when they pass the exams, they start to ask questions and come 
    to the scholars asking for a way out from the vow, but there is no way out 
    and no other option than to fulfil the vow. End quote.","Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 21/54"
44684,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/44684,Her son controls her,"Our problem concerns my husband’s mother. Her youngest son is living with her and he does not do anything for himself and does not work, even though he is in excellent health. He is forty years old and he controls his mother. She does whatever he dictates to her to do. My husband has been spending on them for 35 years. This son of hers incites her against everyone and dictates who she may be pleased with, according to his interests. My husband works abroad and I cannot visit her because he does not want me there. She threw me and my children out and she is foul-mouthed and does not fear Allaah. They visited me when my husband was here and she and her son attacked me and tried to hit me, and they managed to hurt me. My husband and my son who is a university student defended me. The outcome was that they hurt us, then she went out in the street where she started to scream. She went to the police, and she made a complaint against everyone and demanded that my daughters and I be detained in a place that was not befitting for us.  Even the police officer told her that we are respectable. My husband and son were detained and he was supposed to sit exams. His studies have been delayed for a year because of this. After the trial, we paid her the required maintenance; before that my husband used to give her more, but my husband cannot visit her, and the reason for that is that she had her daughter’s husband and his son jailed when they visited her. The problem is that whoever visits her, her son locks the door and calls the police; even her own daughters have the same problem. When her oldest son visited her, he could not enter and her youngest son stopped him and took the money and gifts (that he had brought) and told him, “Your mother will pray to Allaah against you.” 

I do not know what to do or say. I complain to Allaah of my worries. I would like to visit her and honour her, but they is no way I can do that because they fabricate lies against everyone who visits them. What should I do, knowing that I am a grandmother and I fear Allaah. What can I do and what is the shar’i ruling on this?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The way your husband’s mother has behaved is strange. How can 
    her son control her and make her act in this manner? But despite all that 
    your husband has to honour his mother as much as he can, and Allaah does not 
    burden any soul beyond its scope. If he can visit her when this son is not 
    present, that is good. If he can keep in touch with her by phone, then let 
    him do so, and explain to her what he feels, this is good as well. If he can 
    get some people to intervene, women and others, who can influence his 
    mother, then let him do so. And he should seek the help of Allaah and make a 
    lot of du’aa’. 

    The fact that your husband defended himself in court and in 
    front of the police is also good. 

    If he takes his brother who wronged him to court to stop him 
    from doing more harm, that is permissible, but if he bears it with patience 
    that is better for him. 

    Trying to get your husband’s mother away from this oppressive 
    brother (as described in the question) is a good idea, so as to remove the 
    means that your brother is using to try to control the whole family. 

    There is nothing wrong with you stopping visiting her for 
    now, until things settle down, so that you will not be harmed again as 
    happened before, especially since your husband’s mother is not one of your 
    relatives with whom you are enjoined to uphold ties and honour them. If you 
    do not visit her this is not regarded as disobedience or severing of family 
    ties. 
Yes, you will be 
    rewarded for visiting her and treating her kindly, if you do that sincerely 
    for the sake of Allaah, and this is part of treating your husband kindly, 
    but it is not obligatory for you to do that, especially since she is badly 
    behaved and has a bad attitude. And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
44695,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/44695,Are the Jews and Christians who exist nowadays mushrikeen (polytheists) and is it permissible to marry their women?,What is the ruling on marrying a Jewish or Christian woman? Are the Jews and Christians of this age regarded as people of the Book or as mushrikeen?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Marriage to a Jewish or Christian woman is 
    permissible according to the view of the majority of scholars. Ibn Qudaamah 
    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (7/99): 
There is no difference of opinion among the 
    scholars concerning the permissibility of marrying free women of the people 
    of the Book. Among those from whom this view was narrated are ‘Umar, 
    ‘Uthmaan, Talhah, Hudhayfah, Salmaan, Jaabir, and others. 
Ibn al-Mundhir said: There is no sound 
    narration from any of the earliest generation to suggest that this is 
    haraam. Al-Khallaal narrated, with his isnaad, that Hudhayfah, Talhah, 
    al-Jaarood ibn al-Mu’alla and Udhaynah al-‘Abdi all married women from among 
    the people of the Book. This was also the view of the rest of the scholars.
    
The main evidence concerning that is the 
    verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Made lawful to you this day are At Tayyibaat 
    [all kinds of Halaal (lawful) foods, which Allaah has made lawful (meat of 
    slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]. 
    The food (slaughtered cattle, eatable animals) of the people of the 
    Scripture (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to 
    them. (Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and 
    chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) 
    before your time when you have given their due Mahr (bridal-money given by 
    the husband to his wife at the time of marriage), desiring chastity (i.e. 
    taking them in legal wedlock) not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor 
    taking them as girlfriends. And whosoever disbelieves in Faith, [i.e. in the 
    Oneness of Allaah and in all the other Articles of Faith i.e. His (Allaah’s) 
    Angels, His Holy Books, His Messengers, the Day of Resurrection and Al Qadar 
    (Divine Preordainments)], then fruitless is his work; and in the Hereafter 
    he will be among the losers” 
[al-Maa'idah 5:5] 
What is meant by muhsanah (translated here as 
    chaste) is free and chaste women. Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said in his Tafseer: 
This is the view of the majority here, and 
    this is what appears to be the case; lest she not only be a dhimmiyah but 
    also unchaste, in which case she will be totally corrupt and her husband 
    will end up as described in the proverb, “He bought bad dates and was 
    cheated in weights and measures too”. The apparent meaning of the verse is 
    that what is meant by al-muhsanaat (chaste women) is women who refrain from 
    zina, as Allaah says in another verse (interpretation of the meaning):
    
“they (the above said slave-girls) should be 
    chaste [muhsanaat], not committing illegal sex, nor taking boyfriends”
    
[al-Nisa’ 4:25] 
The Christians and Jews are kuffaar and 
    mushrikeen, according to the Qur’aan, but they are excluded from the 
    prohibition on marrying their women, because Allaah says (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 
“And do not marry Al-Mushrikaat 
    (idolatresses) till they believe (worship Allaah Alone). And indeed a slave 
    woman who believes is better than a (free) Mushrikah (idolatress), even 
    though she pleases you” 
[al-Baqarah 2:221] 
This is the clearest way of reconciling 
    between the two verses. 
Allaah has described them as being mushrikeen 
    as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They (Jews and Christians) took their rabbis 
    and their monks to be their lords besides Allaah (by obeying them in things 
    which they made lawful or unlawful according to their own desires without 
    being ordered by Allaah), and (they also took as their Lord) Messiah, son of 
    Maryam (Mary), while they (Jews and Christians) were commanded [in the 
    Tawraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] to worship none but One Ilaah (God 
    — Allaah) Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). 
    Praise and glory be to Him (far above is He) from having the partners they 
    associate (with Him)” 
[al-Tawbah 9:31] 
So they are kuffaar and mushrikeen, but 
    Allaah has permitted us to eat their meat and to marry their women if they 
    are chaste. This is an exemption from the general meaning of the verse in 
    Soorat al-Baqarah. 
But it should be noted that it is better and 
    safer not to marry women of the people of the Book, especially nowadays. Ibn 
    Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “… as this is the case, it is 
    better not to marry a woman of the people of the Book, because ‘Umar said to 
    those who married women of the people of the Book: ‘Divorce them,’ so they 
    divorced them, except Hudhayfah. ‘Umar said to him: ‘Divorce her.’ 
    (Hudhayfah) said: ‘Do you bear witness that she is haraam?’ He said: ‘She is 
    a live coal, divorce her.’ He said: ‘Do you bear witness that she is 
    haraam?’ He said: ‘She is a live coal.’ He said: ‘I know that she is a live 
    coal, but she is permissible for me.’ A while later, he divorced her and it 
    was said to him: ‘Why did you not divorce her when ‘Umar commanded you to?’ 
    He said: ‘I did not want the people to think that I had done something wrong 
    (by marrying her).’ Perhaps he was fond of her or perhaps they had a child 
    together so he was fond of her.” 
Al-Mughni, 7/99 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on 
    him) said: “If the woman of the people of the Book is known to be chaste and 
    to keep away from the means that lead to immorality, it is permissible, 
    because Allaah has permitted that and has permitted us to marry their woman 
    and eat their meat. 
“But nowadays there is the fear that those 
    who marry them may be faced with much evil. They may call him to their 
    religion and that may lead to their children being raised as Christians. So 
    the danger is very real and very serious. To be on the safe side, the 
    believer should not marry them. And in most cases there is no guarantee that 
    the woman will not commit immoral actions, or bring along children from a 
    previous relationship… but if the man needs to do that then there is no sin 
    on him, so that he can keep himself chaste and lower his gaze by being 
    married to her. He should strive to call her to Islam and beware of her evil 
    and of allowing her to drag him or the children towards kufr.”

In the USA kohl is banned as it causes lead poisoning (as they say). Can this be true? because I would like to apply it as well, as I suffer from poor vision.","Kohl is good and is not harmful to the eyes, rather it is beneficial. But there may be some kinds of modern, manufactured kohl that contain some chemical ingredients which may cause physical damage and remove some of the benefits of kohl.",,"Praise be to Allah.In a number of Hadiths it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used kohl and commanded others to do so. For example it is narrated in the Musannaf of Ibn Abu Shaybah (may Allah have mercy on him), from the Hadith of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to apply kohl to his right eye three times, and to his left eye twice. This Hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah no. 633. And it was proven in Sunan An-Nasa’i (5113) and Sunan Abu Dawud (3837) and elsewhere, from the Hadith of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of your kohl is ithmid (antimony), for it makes the vision clear and makes the hair  grow.” 
Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Kohl protects the health of the eyes and gives strength and clarity of vision, and cleanses the eye of bad substances. In addition to that some types of kohl also serve as an adornment and if it is applied before going to bed this is even better, and ithmid is more efficacious than other types of kohl.” (Zad Al-Ma`ad, 4/281) 
It says in Al-Mughni: “It is recommended to use kohl an odd number of times.” (Al-Mughni, 1/106)
It says in Al-Majmu`: “With regard to using kohl an odd number of times, there is a difference of scholarly opinion. It was said that it should be applied an odd number of times to one eye and an even number of times to the other, so that the total number will be odd. The correct view of the scholars who examined this issue is that it should be applied an odd number of times to each eye. Based on this, the Sunnah is to apply it three times to each eye.” (Al-Majmu` 1/334) 
Shaykh Ibn `Uthyamin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Some eye doctors say that kohl is harmful to the eyes and they advise not using it. What do you say to them? 
He replied: 
“Ithmid (antimony) is known to be very good for the eyes. I do not know anything about other types of kohl. Trustworthy doctors are the ones whom we should consult on this matter. 
It was said of Zarqa’ Al-Yamamah, who could see as far as three days, that when she was killed, they saw that all the veins of her eyes bore traces of this ithmid.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, vol. 17; Chapter on medical treatment and visiting the sick) 
From the above it is known that kohl is good and is not harmful to the eyes, rather it is beneficial. But there may be some kinds of modern, manufactured kohl that contain some chemical ingredients which may cause physical damage and remove some of the benefits of kohl. Hence people nowadays should look for pure kohl and not regard every kind of kohl available nowadays as beneficial.
