43736,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43736,Statement from the Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas concerning the prohibition of singing and music,"I read an article by some writer which said that singing and music are permissible, and refuted those who say that these things are haraam. He encouraged the broadcasting of recordings by dead singers as a means to preserve their memory and the art that they produced during their lives and lest the living be deprived of listening to that art and seeing it. He said: There is no text in the Holy Qur’aan which forbids singing and music, and in the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) we have a good example, and he used to listen to singing and music, and enjoined them at Eid and on occasions such as marriage and other joyous occasions. Then he said: And there are da’eef (weak) ahaadeeth which some quote as evidence that singing and music are forbidden, but it is not right to attribute them to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in order to support an opinion or prevent something that some people do not agree with. Then he quoted the opinions of some of the scholars who say that singing is allowed.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Standing Committee 
      for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas issued a statement refuting this 
      article, the text of which is as follows: 

    The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 

    In refutation of these specious arguments the Committee has 
    stated the following: 

    Firstly: it is not permissible for anyone to discuss matters 
    of sharee’ah except scholars of sharee’ah who are specialized and qualified 
    to research and examine issues. The writer of this article is not a seeker 
    of shar’i knowledge (taalib ‘ilm) so it is not permissible for him to 
    discuss something in which he is not specialized. Hence he has made many 
    mistakes and said many ignorant things, and spoken about Allaah and His 
    Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) without 
    knowledge. This is a sinful matter and is misguiding his readers. By the 
    same token it is not permissible for the media – newspapers, magazines, etc 
    – to give space to those who are not scholars of sharee’ah to discuss shar’i 
    rulings and write about things that are not their specialty, so that the 
    Muslims may be protected from their ideas and beliefs.  

    Secondly: Nothing can benefit the deceased after his death 
    except that which is indicated by the shar’i evidence, such as the report in 
    which the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “When a man dies, his (good) deeds come to an end except three: ongoing 
    charity, beneficial knowledge and a righteous son who will pray for him.” 
    Narrated by Muslim, 1631. As for the sins that a person committed during his 
    lifetime, and died without having repented from them – including singing – 
    he will be punished for them unless Allaah forgives him for them by His 
    Grace and kindness. So it is not permissible to resurrect them and revive 
    them after he has died, lest that sin be added to the sins that he committed 
    during his lifetime, because the harm of that extends to others, as the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever 
    introduces a bad practice into Islam, the burden of that sin will be upon 
    him, as will the sin of those who do it after him, without that detracting 
    from their burden in the slightest.” Narrated by Muslim, 1017. 

    Thirdly: With regard to his comment that “There is no text in 
    the Holy Qur’aan which forbids singing and music,” this reflects his 
    ignorance of the Qur’aan. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. 
    music, singing) to mislead (men) from the path of Allaah without knowledge, 
    and takes it (the path of Allaah, or the Verses of the Qur’aan) by way of 
    mockery. For such there will be a humiliating torment (in the Hell‑fire)”

    [Luqmaan 31:6]
The majority of 
    mufassireen say that what is meant by Lahwa al-hadeeth (“idle talks”) 
    in this verse is singing. Another group says that it is every sound of 
    entertainment, which includes flutes, stringed instruments and so on. All of 
    these mislead men from the path of Allaah and cause misguidance. It is 
    proven that Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him), the great Sahaabi 
    who was one of the scholars of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with 
    them) said, commenting on this verse: “By Allaah, this refers to singing.” 
    And he said: “It causes hypocrisy to grow in the heart as water causes herbs 
    to grow.” 

    And there are many ahaadeeth which point to the prohibition 
    of singing and musical instruments and indicate that they are a means which 
    leads to great evil and bad consequences. The great scholar Ibn al-Qayyim 
    (may Allaah be pleased with him) discussed the rulings on singing and 
    musical instruments in great detail in his book Ighaathat al-Lahfaan. 

    Fourthly: This writer tells lies about the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) by saying that he used to listen 
    to songs and music and enjoined them at Eid and on occasions such as 
    marriage and other joyous occasions. It is proven that he  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) granted a dispensation to women only, when 
    there are no men present, allowing them to beat the daff and sing nasheeds 
    which are free of any mention of love or the music and instruments, which 
    includes the permissive songs that exist nowadays. Rather he allowed 
    nasheeds that are free of such offensive characteristics and he allowed 
    beating the daff only, not other kinds of drums or musical instruments, to 
    proclaim marriage. It is narrated in saheeh ahaadeeth, as in Saheeh 
    al-Bukhaari, that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) forbade musical instruments of all types and issued stern warnings 
    against them. It is narrated in Saheeh al-Bukhaari and other books of 
    hadeeth that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “There will be among my ummah people who will regard as permissible 
    zina (adultery), silk, alcohol and ma’aazif (musical instruments). 
    Some people will camp at the top of a mountain with their shepherd looking 
    after their sheep, and a poor man will come and ask for something, and they 
    will say, ‘Come back to us tomorrow.’ But Allaah will destroy them and level 
    the mountain, and will turn others into monkeys and pigs until the Day of 
    Resurrection.” 

    The word ma’aazif (translated above as musical 
    instruments) refers to singing and all kinds of instruments. The Messenger 
    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) condemned those 
    who regard as permissible zina (adultery), the wearing of silk for men and 
    the drinking of alcohol, and who listen to singing and musical instruments. 
    He mentioned that alongside zina, alcohol and the wearing of silk by men, 
    which indicates that singing and musical instruments are emphatically 
    forbidden. 

    Fifthly:  With regard to this writer’s comment that there are da’eef (weak) ahaadeeth which some quote 
    as evidence that singing and music are forbidden, but it is not right to 
    attribute them to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) in order to support an opinion or prevent something that some people do 
    not agree with, this reflects his ignorance of the Sunnah, for the 
    evidence that singing is forbidden is to be found partly in the Qur’aan and 
    partly in Saheeh al-Bukhaari, as stated above, and partly in other 
    books of Sunnah, which the earlier scholars used as evidence that singing 
    and music are forbidden. 

    Sixthly: The opinion of some scholars who allow singing is an 
    opinion that is refuted by the evidence which forbids that. The point here 
    is that we should follow what the evidence says and not that which goes 
    against it. We may take or leave the words of anyone except the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).  

    This writer must repent to Allaah from what he has written, 
    and he should nor speak about Allaah and His Messenger without knowledge, 
    for speaking about Allaah without knowledge is mentioned alongside shirk in 
    the Book of Allaah. 

    May Allaah help us all to learn the truth and follow it. 

    May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad 
    and upon his family and companions.",Islam Q&A
43737,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43737,"The imam’s pronunciation is defective, and some of the members of the congregation are hiding the fact that they have more knowledge of Quran","Our imam substitutes some letters for others, and among us are those who recite well and have memorized a large portion of the Quran. What is the ruling on the person described leading the prayers? What is the ruling on the member of the congregation who has memorized a lot and recites well, given that he has not clearly stated that he recites well and has memorized a great deal?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.In the answer to question no. 50536 we have stated that the scholars differed concerning leading of the prayers by one whose pronunciation is defective (i.e., he substitutes some letters for others). The correct view is that his leading the prayers is valid, but it is better for the prayers to be led by one who recites correctly. 
Shaykh Muhammad al-Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen said: 
If an illiterate person who does not know al-Faatihah leads another illiterate person like him in prayer (illiterate here means one who does not know how to recite al-Faatihah properly), then his prayer is valid because they are equal in their shortcoming. If an illiterate person leads a literate person (i.e., one who can recite al-Faatihah properly) in prayer, then this is not valid. This is our madhhab. 
The reason for that is that the person praying behind the imam is of a higher status than the imam, so how can one who is higher in status be led by one who is lower? 
The second opinion – which is what was narrated from Ahmad – is that it is valid for an illiterate man to lead a literate man in prayer, but we should avoid that, because it involves going against the words of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “The people should be led in prayer by the one among them who has the most knowledge of Quran.”  
If he is able to correct it then his prayer is not valid. 
i.e., if the illiterate man is able to correct faults in his recitation that alter the meaning, but he does not do so, then his prayer is not valid. If he is not able to do so then his prayer is valid, but it is not valid for him to lead anyone in prayer except others who are like him. 
But the correct view is that it is valid for him to lead the prayers in this case, because he is excused, as he is unable to correct his recitation of al-Faatihah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can” [al-Taghaabun 64:16]
“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope” [al-Baqarah 2:286]
In some remote regions there is no one who can recite al-Faatihah properly, so you may hear them saying ahdina (instead of ihdina = guide us), and they can only recite it in the manner to which they are accustomed, and are unable to correct the pronunciation. Their prayer is valid. But if a person is able to correct it and does not, then his prayer is not valid, if that changes the meaning. Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/248, 249 
A person who cannot recite well should not be chosen to lead the prayer, even if he is hafiz (i.e., has memorized the entire Quran). Rather the one who is chosen to lead the prayer should be one who can recite well and pronounce the letters properly, and also adhere to all the other rulings of prayer. 
Shaykh Muhammad al-Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
The words “The one who is most entitled to lead the prayer is the one who has most knowledge of Quran and knows the fiqh of prayer” – does “the one who has most knowledge of Quran” mean the one who recites it in the best manner and recites perfectly, pronouncing each letter properly, or does it mean the one who has memorized the most Quran? 
The answer is that what is meant is the one who recites in the best manner, with proper tajweed. This does not mean the tajweed that is known nowadays… It is not essential to recite Quran with ghunnah and maddaad or to have a beautiful voice. The more beautiful the voice, the better, but it is not essential. 
The phrase “and knows the fiqh of prayer” means: he understands the fiqh of prayer so that if some situation arises during the prayer, such as sahw (forgetting something), he can apply the rulings of sharee’ah. 
This has to do with choosing someone to lead the prayers, i.e., if there is a group or congregation and they want to choose one of their number to lead them in prayer. But if the mosque has a regular imam, then he is more entitled in every case, so long as there is no reason why he should not lead them. Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/205, 206. 
Secondly: 
The one who recites well should not hide the fact and let one who does not recite well lead the prayer, because this is going against the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “The people should be led in prayer by the one among them who has most knowledge of the Book of Allah…” Narrated by Muslim, 673. 
With regard to the words “the people should be led in prayer”, al-Teebi said: This is a command, i.e., let them be led in prayer… 
Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath: 
It is obvious that choosing the one who has most knowledge of Quran to lead the prayer applies only if he also knows what must be known with regard to prayer. If he is ignorant of that then he should not be appointed to lead the prayer, according to scholarly consensus.",Islam Q&A
43738,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43738,There is no specific amount which must be recited in Taraaweeh prayer,Is there a specific amount which must be recited in Taraaweeh prayer?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.There is no specific amount which must be recited in Taraaweeh prayer, but the longer it is the better, so long as that does not cause hardship for the members of the congregation. 
Al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
With regard to recitation in night prayers (qiyaam) in Ramadaan and at other times, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not set a specific limit and state that one is not allowed to do more or less than that. Rather his recitation in Taraaweeh used to vary, sometimes being short and sometimes being long. Sometimes he would recite in each rak’ah a verse which was equivalent in length to al-Muzammil, which is twenty verses long, and sometimes he would recite something that was fifty verses long. And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to say: “Whoever prays with a hundred verses at night will not be recorded as one of the negligent.” 
According to another hadeeth, “… with one hundred verses, he will be recorded as one of the devout and sincere.” 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) recited the seven long ones in prayer at night when he was sick. These are: al-Baqarah, Aal ‘Imraan, al-Nisa’, al-Maa'idah, al-An’aam, al-A’raaf and al-Tawbah. 
In the story of the prayer of Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan praying behind the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), it states that in one rak’ah he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) recited al-Baqarah, then al-Nisa’, then Aal ‘Imraan, and he recited them at a slow and deliberate pace.  
It is narrated with the soundest of isnaads that when ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) commanded Ubayy ibn Ka’b to lead the people in praying eleven rak’ahs during Ramadaan, Ubayy (may Allaah be pleased with him) used to recite the hundreds (i.e., the soorahs with more than 100 verses), until those who were behind him used to lean on sticks because of the length of the recitation, and they did not depart until shortly before Fajr. 
It is narrated in another saheeh report that ‘Umar would call the reciters in Ramadaan, and he would tell those who were quickest in recitation to recite thirty verses, those who were moderate in the speed of recitation to recite twenty-five, and those who recited slowly to recite twenty. 
Based on this, if a person is praying qiyaam by himself, he may make it as long as he wants. The same applies if the ones who are praying with him are similar to him in stamina. The longer it is the better, but he should not make it so long that he spends the whole night awake, expect occasionally, following the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) who said: “The best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad.” 
But if he is leading others in prayer, then he should make it only so long as not to cause hardship to those who are praying behind him, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When any one of you leads the people in prayer, let him make the prayer short, because among them are the young, the elderly, the weak, the sick and those who are in need. But if he is praying qiyaam by himself, let him make his prayer as long as he wants.

I sent the fatwa to Shaykh ‘Abd-Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Humayd and Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on them) for their comments on it and they said:  
The basic principle is that it is obligatory to fast Ramadan, and to form the intention to fast from the night before, for all adult Muslims, who should start the day fasting, except for those to whom the Lawgiver has granted a concession, who are allowed not to fast – namely the sick, travellers and those who come under those headings. Those who do hard work come under the heading of those who are obliged to fast and they are not like the sick or travellers. They have to form the intention to observe the Ramadan fast from the night before, and to start the day fasting. If one of them is forced to break the fast during the day, then it is permissible for him to break the fast with enough to ward off any harm, then he must refrain from eating and drinking for the rest of the day, and he has to make up that fast at the proper time. If there is no such necessity then it is obligatory to complete the fast. This is what is indicated by the shar’i evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and it is what is indicated by the words of the scholars of all madhhabs. 
Those in positions of authority among the Muslims among whom are people who do hard work should examine their case when Ramadan comes, and if possible, they should not burden them with too much work that may force them to break the fast during the day in Ramadan, rather they should have the work done at night, or distribute work hours in a fair and just manner so that people may both work and fast. 
As for the fatwa referred to, this has to do with an individual case where they issued a fatwa based on their ijtihaad for which they are to be appreciated, but they did not mention the conditions that we have mentioned or the view of the scholars of all madhhabs. We ask Allah to help us all to do that which is good. End quote.

      The Standing Committee has issued a statement warning 
      against the “Star Academy” show and all such shows that are known as 
      “reality TV”, which show the lives of people with their evil and 
      corruption so that the Muslims can imitate them and be influenced by their 
      evil. We will quote their statement here for the benefit of readers. 
Statement warning against the “Star Academy” show and 
    similar shows 
, the Lord of the Worlds, and blessings 
    and peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad and all his family and companions. 
    
    The Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing 
    Fatwas has studied the questions from a number of proud Muslims concerning 
    the program broadcast by some Arabic satellite channels which is called 
    “Star Academy” and other similar shows. After studying the matter, the 
    Committee thinks that these shows should be banned and it is haraam to watch 
    them, finance them, take part in them, call them to vote or to express 
    admiration of them, because of what these shows include of allowing 
    forbidden things concerning which there is consensus that they are 
    forbidden, and doing so brazenly. According to the hadeeth, the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There will be among my 
    ummah people who will regard as permissible zina (adultery), silk, alcohol 
    and musical instruments.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari from the hadeeth of Abu 
    Maalik al-Ash’ari (may Allaah be pleased with him). And it was narrated that 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “All of 
    my ummah will be fine except those who commit sin brazenly. It is part of 
    brazenness that a man does something at night, then in the morning when 
    Allaah has concealed him, he says, ‘O So and so, I did such and such last 
    night.’ His Lord concealed him all night, but in the morning he uncovered 
    that which Allaah had concealed for him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim 
    from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him). What 
    brazenness in committing haraam and immoral actions can be worse than these 
    shows which include a number of serious evils? These include: 

    1 – free mixing of the sexes. Allaah says (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 

    “And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask 
    them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and for their 
    hearts”

    [al-Ahzaab 33:53]
According to the hadeeth, 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No one 
    of you is alone with a (non mahram) woman but the Shaytaan is the third one 
    present.” Narrated by Imam Ahmad with a saheeh isnaad from ‘Umar ibn 
    al-Khattaab.  

    So what about these programs, the main idea of which is 
    mixing between the sexes and removing all barriers between them, as well as 
    the wanton display and unveiling on the part of the women, and displaying 
    their charms which leads to much evil? Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “… and not to show off their adornment except only that 
    which is apparent (like both eyes for necessity to see the way, or outer 
    palms of hands or one eye or dress like veil, gloves, headcover, apron), and 
    to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks 
    and bosoms) and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands …”

    [al-Noor 24:31]

    2 – Blatant promotion of immorality and the means that lead 
    to it. 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Verily, those who like that (the crime of) illegal sexual 
    intercourse should be propagated among those who believe, they will have a 
    painful torment in this world and in the Hereafter. And Allaah knows and you 
    know not”

    [al-Noor 24:19]

    3 – The call to remove haya’ (modesty, shyness) and gheerah 
    (protective jealousy, pride) from the hearts of the Muslims by making them 
    get used to seeing these shameful scenes that provoke desires and distancing 
    them from good morals and virtue. 

    According to a hadeeth, the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) said: “Among the words that have come down to the 
    people from the earlier Prophets is: If you feel no shame then do as you 
    wish.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari from the hadeeth of Abu Mas’ood al-Badri (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him). 

    And it was narrated that the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Faith has seventy-odd branches, and 
    haya’ is one of the branches of faith.” Agreed upon; from the hadeeth of Abu 
    Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him). 

    It was also narrated that he  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Are you surprised at the gheerah (protective 
    jealousy) of Sa’d? I am more jealous than he is, and Allaah is more jealous 
    than I.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari from the hadeeth of al-Mugheerah ibn 
    Shu’bah (may Allaah be pleased with him). 

    It is not sufficient for you to abstain from watching these 
    shows; you should also advise and remind those whom you know watch them or 
    take part in them in any way, because that comes under the heading of 
    cooperating in righteousness and piety, and forbidding one another to engage 
    in sin and transgression. 

    The Committee also calls upon the businessmen who finance 
    these shows to fear Allaah with regard to the blessing of wealth that Allaah 
    has bestowed upon them, and not use it for things that will adversely affect 
    the youth of this ummah, destroy the symbols of Islam and serve the enemies 
    of Islam, for this is a kind of ingratitude for blessings and is a cause of 
    their loss. 

    It is obvious that these kinds of shows are among the causes 
    of disasters that strike Islam and the Muslims. Allaah says (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 

    “And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of 
    what your hands have earned. And He pardons much”

    [al-Shoora 42:30]

    In al-Saheehayn it is narrated from the hadeeth of 
    Zaynab (may Allaah be pleased with her) that the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) entered upon her suddenly and said: “Laa 
    ilaaha ill-Allaah (There is no god but Allaah), woe to the Arabs from an 
    evil that has drawn nigh! Today a (hole) like this was opened in the wall of 
    Ya’jooj and Ma’jooj,” and he made a circle with his thumb and forefinger. 
    Zaynab bint Jahsh said: I said: “O Messenger of Allaah, will we be destroyed 
    when there are righteous people among us?” He said, “Yes, if there is a 
    great deal of evil.” 

    We ask Allaah by His Most Beautiful Names and His Sublime 
    Attributes to protect us and all the Muslims from the sources of temptation 
    both obvious and hidden, and not to punish us for what the foolish among us

      was written by a great Sunni scholar, and the scholars still recommend 
      them. Each of them has its own characteristics which means that the seeker 
      of knowledge cannot show preference to one of them over the other. There 
      follow a few comments on these two Tafseers. 

    1 – Tafseer al-Tabari 
Imam Muhammad ibn Jareer 
    al-Tabari was born in 224 AH and died in 310 AH, at the age of eighty-six, 
    in the region of Tabaristan. 

    His Tafseer is entitled Jaami’ al-Bayaan fi Ta’weel 
    Aayi-‘l-Qur’aan. 
Abu Haamid al-Isfaraayini 
    said: If a traveller were to travel to China in order to obtain it, that 
    would not be too much.  

    Tabaqaat al-Mufassireen by 
    al-Dawoodi, 2/106. 
Ibn Khuzaymah said: I 
    have read it from beginning to end and I do not know of anyone on the face 
    of the earth who is more knowledgeable than Ibn Jareer. 

    Siyar A’laam al-Nubala’, 14/273. 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: With regard to the 
    Tafseers that are in circulation among the people, the most sound of them is 
    the Tafseer of Muhammad ibn Jareer al-Tabari, for he mentions the views of 
    the salaf with proven isnaads, and there is no bid’ah (innovation) in it, 
    and he does not transmit reports from dubious sources such as Muqaatil ibn 
    Bukayr and al-Kalbi. 

    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 13/358. 

    He also said in Muqaddimah fi Usool al-Tafseer (p. 
    35), concerning the Tafseer of Ibn Jareer: 

    It is one of the best and greatest of Tafseers. 

    He relied on the views of three generations of mufassireen 
    among the salaf, namely the Sahaabah, the Taabi’een, and the followers of 
    the Taabi’een, and he quotes their opinions with isnaads going back to them. 
    This is an important feature of his book which is not present in many of the 
    books of Tafseer that are in circulation among us. But this feature does not 
    matter to many ordinary Muslims who are not able to research isnaads and 
    distinguish sound isnaads from weak ones; all they want is to know whether 
    an isnaad is sound or weak by means of a clear and brief statement to that 
    effect.  

    When he has finished quoting their opinions, he states which 
    he thinks is most likely to be correct, then he describes how he reached 
    that conclusion.  

    2 – Tafseer Ibn Katheer 

    His full name is Abu’l-Fida’ Ismaa’eel ibn Katheer 
    al-Dimashqi, d. 774 AH. 

    His Tafseer is entitled Tafseer al-Qur’aan il-‘Azeem. 
Al-Suyooti (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said concerning this Tafseer: Nothing like it has ever 
    been written. 

    Tadhkirat al-Huffaaz, p. 534. 
This Tafseer is based on 
    commentary by quoting texts – verses and ahaadeeth – and its fame is second 
    to the fame of al-Tabari among later scholars. 

    It is written in an excellent and easy style which is not 
    longwinded or boring, or too short and boring.  

    He explains verses by quoting other verses, and he quotes 
    appropriate verses which explain the verse under discussion; then he quotes 
    ahaadeeth that have been narrated on the same topic as the verse, and he 
    quotes the isnaads of some, especially those that were narrated by Imam 
    Ahmad in his Musnad, as he is one of those who memorized al-Musnad. 
    He discusses the soundness and weakness of the ahaadeeth in most cases, 
    which is an important feature of his Tafseer. Then he quotes the views of 
    the salaf, including the Sahaabah and Taabi’een, and he states which view he 
    believes to be superior. He also avoids odd dissenting opinions. 
Muhammad ibn Ja’far 
    al-Kataani said of it: It is full of ahaadeeth and reports with the isnaads 
    of those who narrated them and discussion of how sound or weak they are. 

    Al-Risaalah al-Mustatrafah, p. 
    195  

    He draws attention to the shar’i attitude towards the 
    Israa’eeliyyaat (reports from Jewish sources) and quotes some of them in his 
    commentary on some verses. 

    Conclusion: 

    No seeker of knowledge can do without these two books. With 
    regard to which is superior, nothing like the Tafseer of Ibn Jareer 
    (al-Tabari) has been written since. It is essential for scholars and seekers 
    of knowledge, but it is not appropriate for ordinary people because they are 
    not qualified to understand it properly. The Tafseer of Ibn Katheer is more 
    appropriate for the ordinary people, and there is much in it from which 
    scholars and seekers of knowledge can benefit.

      nothing wrong with this woman leading her sisters in praying taraweeh in 
      congregation, or leading them in prayer, so long as she adheres to the 
      conditions, pillars (essential parts) and obligatory parts of the prayer. 
      Perhaps leading others will help her to control herself and not pay any 
      attention to the waswaas. 

    It is expected that the doubts will become less and she will 
    become more in control of her prayer when there are others praying behind 
    her.
