Signs of a good end that appear to the dying person 


Signs of a good end in Islam","Praise be to Allah.What is a good end in Islam?
A good end in Islam means when a person was guided before his death to keep away from that which angers the Lord and to repent from sin, and to focus on doing acts of worship and good deeds, and then he died in this good state. 
One of the indications of this is the authentic Hadith narrated from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah wills good for His slave, He uses him.” They said, “How does He use him?” He said, “He guides him to do good deeds before he dies .” (Narrated by Ahmad, 11625; At-Tirmidhi, 2142; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 1334)
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah wills good for His slave, He sweetens him.” He was asked: “What is this sweetening?” He said: “Allah guides him to do righteous deeds before he dies, then He takes (his soul) whilst he is in that state.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 17330; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 1114) 
Signs of a good end that appear to the dying person 
There are signs of a good end, some of which are seen by the dying person as he is dying, and some which may be visible to other people. 
With regard to the signs of a good end that appear to the dying person, these are things that give him the glad tidings, as he is dying, indicating that Allah is pleased with him. As Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, those who say: ‘Our Lord is Allah (Alone),’ and then they stand firm, on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): ‘Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you have been promised!’” [Fussilat 41:30] 
These glad tidings come to the believers when they are dying. (See Tafsir Ibn Sa`di, 1256) 
This is also indicated by the Hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari, 6507; Muslim, 2683 from the Mother of the Believers `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever loves to meet Allah, Allah loves to meet him, and whoever hates to meet Allah, Allah hates to meet him.” I said, “O Prophet of Allah, do you mean hating death , for all of us hate death?” He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “It is not like that; but when the believer is given the glad tidings of the mercy and pleasure of Allah, and His Paradise, he loves to meet Allah, And when the disbeliever is given the tidings of the wrath and punishment of Allah, he hates to meet Allah and Allah hates to meet him.” 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“What this Hadith means is that the love and hate that are referred to here are those that happen when one enters the stage in which repentance is not accepted, where the dying person is told of his situation and he is shown his destiny.” 
Signs of a good end in Islam
There are many signs of a good end , which the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) have derived from the texts which speak of that. These signs include the following: 

Uttering the Shahadah (testimony of faith) when dying. 

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “A person whose last words are La ilaha illallah [there is none worthy of being worshipped but Allah] will enter Paradise.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 3116; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawood, 2673)

Dying with sweat on the forehead. 

Buraydah ibn Al-Husayb (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, “The believer dies with sweat on his forehead.” Narrated by Ahmad, 22513; At-Tirmidhi, 980; An-Nasa’i, 1828. (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi) 

Dying on the night or day of Friday.

The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no Muslim who dies on the day of Friday or the night of Friday, but Allah will protect him from the trial (fitnah) of the grave.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 6546; At-Tirmidhi, 1074. Al-Albani said: When all its Isnads (chains of narrators) are taken into consideration, this Hadith is sound or authentic) 

Dying as a fighter for the sake of Allah.

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Think not of those as dead who are killed in the way of Allah. Nay, they are alive, with their Lord, and they have provision.
They rejoice in what Allah has bestowed upon them of His Bounty and rejoice for the sake of those who have not yet joined them, but are left behind (not yet martyred) that on them no fear shall come, nor shall they grieve.
They rejoice in a grace and a bounty from Allah, and that Allah will not waste the reward of the believers.” [Al `Imran 3:169] 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever is killed for the sake of Allah is a martyr, and whoever dies for the sake of Allah is a martyr.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1915) 

Dying of the plague.

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The plague is martyrdom for every Muslim.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2830; Muslim, 1916) 
`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), said: I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about the plague, and he told me that it is a punishment that Allah sends upon whomsoever He will, and that Allah has made it a mercy for the believers, for there is no one who stays in his land at the time of a plague, bearing that with patience and seeking Allah’s reward, knowing that nothing will befall him but that which Allah has decreed for him, but he will be given a reward like that of a martyr.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 3474) 

Dying of a stomach disease . 

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “… and whoever dies of a stomach disease is a martyr.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1915) 

Dying because of being crushed by a falling wall or by drowning.

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The martyrs are five: the one who dies of plague, the one who dies of a stomach disease, the one who drowns, the one who is crushed by a falling wall, and the one who is martyred for the sake of Allah.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2829; Muslim, 1915) 

If a woman dies as a result of childbirth, or when she is pregnant. 

The evidence for that includes the Hadith narrated by Abu Dawud (3111), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “A woman who dies with child is a martyr.” Al-Khattabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “What this means is if she dies with a child in her womb.” (`Awn Al-Ma`bud)
Imam Ahmad narrated (17341) that `Ubadah ibn As-Samit (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us about the martyrs and mentioned among them, “A woman who is killed by the child in her womb attains martyrdom, and her child will drag her by his umbilical cord to Paradise.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Kitab Al-Jana’iz, p. 39)  

Death caused by burning , pleurisy and tuberculosis. 

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Being killed for the sake of Allah is martyrdom; the plague is martyrdom; drowning is martyrdom; dying of a stomach disease is martyrdom; and the woman who dies in childbirth, her child will drag her by his umbilical cord to Paradise.” (Abu Al-`Awam, the custodian of Bayt Al-Maqdis added: and burning and tuberculosis). (Al-Albani classed it as authentic Sahih At-Targhib wa At-Tarhib, 1396) 

Dying to defend one’s religion, wealth or life.

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever is killed defending his wealth is a martyr; whoever is killed defending his religion is a martyr; whoever is killed in self-defence is a martyr.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1421) 
Al-Bukhari (2480) and Muslim (141) narrated that ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever is killed defending his wealth is a martyr.” 

Dying guarding the borders of Islam for the sake of Allah. 

Muslim (1913) narrated that Salman Al-Farisi (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Guarding the borders of Islam for one day and one night is better than fasting and praying at night for a whole month, and if he dies (whilst performing this duty), he will go on receiving the reward for this great deed and his provision (continually), and he will be spared the questioning in the grave. ” 

Dying whilst doing a righteous deed.

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:  “Whoever says La ilaha illallah, seeking the Countenance of Allah thereby, and that is the last of his deeds, will enter Paradise. Whoever gives charity and that is the last of his deeds will enter Paradise.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 22813; Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Kitab Al-Jana’iz, p. 43. See Kitab Al-Jana’iz by Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him), p. 34) 
These are the good signs which indicate a good end, but despite that we cannot be certain that a specific person is one of the people of Paradise unless the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) testified that he will go to Paradise, such as the four Rightly Guided Caliphs. 
We ask Allah to grant us a good end.

Do not let the Shaytaan play with you. We ask Allah to forgive you.
2-But if you had the intention of not doing the prayer until after the time was over, or you were hesitant about the matter – this is the action which, according to some of the scholars, makes a person a kaafir.

10922,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10922,Why Is Smoking Haram?,Why is smoking haram?,,"The reasons why smoking is haram


1.Islam forbids everything that is harmful


2.Spending on smoking is spending on something harmful 


3.Smoking has caused many disasters


4.Many people are offended by the smell of smokers","Praise be to Allah.The reasons why smoking is haram
1.Islam forbids everything that is harmful
Perhaps you know that all nations of the world – Muslim and kafir alike – have now started to fight smoking, because they know that it is very harmful. 
Islam forbids everything that is harmful, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There should be no harming or reciprocating harm.”  
Undoubtedly there are foods and drinks which are beneficial and good, and others which are harmful and bad. Allah described our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the following terms (interpretation of the meaning):
“…he allows them as lawful At Tayyibat (i.e. all good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), and prohibits them as unlawful Al Khabaith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods)” [al-A'raf 7:157]
Is smoking one of the good and lawful things (al-tayyibat) or one of the evil and unlawful things (al-khabaith)?
2.Spending on smoking is spending on something harmful 
It was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah forbids you to trade gossip, to ask too many questions and to waste money.” And Allah forbade wasteful extravagance when He said (interpretation of the meaning):
“and eat and drink but waste not by extravagance, certainly He (Allah) likes not Al-Musrifun (those who waste by extravagance)” [al-A'raf 7:31] 
And He described the slaves of the Most Merciful as follows (interpretation of the meaning):
“And those who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor stingy, but hold a medium (way) between those (extremes)” [al-Furqan 25:67]
The whole world now knows that the money spent on smoking is to be considered as money wasted, from which no benefit is gained. Indeed, it is money spent on something harmful. 
If the money which is spent on smoking worldwide were to be collected, it could have saved entire populations who have died of starvation. Is there anyone more foolish than one who holds a dollar bill and sets fire to it? What is the difference between him and the one who smokes? Indeed, the smoker is more foolish, because the folly of the one who burns a dollar bill ends there, whilst the one who smokes burns his money and also harms his body.
3.Smoking has caused many disasters
How many disasters have been caused by smoking, because of cigarette butts which are thrown away and cause fires. Other disasters have been caused in other ways, as when a house was burned down with its occupants inside, when a man lit his cigarette when there was a gas leak.
4.Many people are offended by the smell of smokers
How many people are offended by the smell of smokers , especially when you are unfortunate enough to have one of them standing next to you in the mosque. Probably any nasty smell is easier to bear than the smell of the smoker’s mouth when he has just woken up. It is amazing how many women can put up with the smell of their husbands’ mouths! 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade those who had eaten garlic or onions from coming to the mosque so that they would not offend their fellow-worshippers with their smell. The smell of onions and garlic is easier to bear than the smell of the smoker and his mouth. 
These are some of the reasons why smoking is haram.

10923,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10923,Is Murder in Islam a Major Sin?,"I took part in a murder, but I was not caught for this crime. I want to expiate for my sin. Will Allah accept my repentance without me having to hand myself in to the police?","Murder is one of the greatest of major sins according to the Quran and the Sunnah. If you kill a believer deliberately, then there are three rights which are connected to that; 1- rights of Allah, 2- rights of the victim, 3- and the rights of the victim’s next of kin.","Murder in Islam: One of the greatest major sins


Rights connected to killing a believer deliberately","Praise be to Allah.Murder in Islam: One of the greatest major sins
Murder (killing a person deliberately), if the victim is a believer, is one of the greatest of major sins. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell to abide therein; and the Wrath and the Curse of Allah are upon him, and a great punishment is prepared for him” [al-Nisa 493]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“A man will continue to be sound in his religion so long as he does not shed blood which it is forbidden to shed.”
Rights connected to killing a believer deliberately
If you killed a believer deliberately, then there are three rights which are connected to that: the rights of Allah, the rights of the victim and the rights of the victim’s next of kin.

With regard to the rights of Allah: if you repent sincerely to your Lord, then Allah will accept your repentance . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say: “O ‘Ibadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Zumar 39:53]
With regard to the rights of the victim, he is not alive so you cannot put things right with him. The matter has to wait until the Day of Resurrection, i.e., the settling of scores with you on behalf of the victim will take place on the Day of Resurrection. But I hope that if your repentance is correct and is accepted by Allah, then Allah will compensate the victim with what He wills of His bounty until he is satisfied, and you will be reprieved. 
With regard to the rights of the victim’s next of kin, which is the third right, you cannot be absolved of this until you hand yourself over to them. Therefore you have to hand yourself over to the victim’s next of kin, and tell them that you are the one who killed him, then they have the choice. If they want to they can exact vengeance upon you, if the conditions of qasas are met; or if they want to they may take the diyah (blood money) from you; or if they want to they can forgive you.

A woman, like anyone else among the children of Adam, if anything befalls her and she bears it with patience and seeks reward (from Allaah), then she will be rewarded for these pains and calamities. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave the example of something that is less severe than that, and said that if a thorn pricks a person, he will have expiation because of that. It should be noted that if a person bears the disasters that befall him with patience and seeks reward from Allah, he will be rewarded for his patience and seeking reward, and the disaster itself will be an expiation for his sins. Calamities expiate sins in all cases; if that is accompanied by patience, a person will be rewarded for his patience in the face of those calamities. When a woman gives birth, there is no doubt that she endures pain and suffering; this pain is an expiation for her, and if she bears it with patience and seeks reward from Allah, that will increase her reward and hasanaat… and Allah knows best.","From the fataawa of Shaykh ibn ‘Uthaymeen,  Majallah al-Da’wah, no. 1789, p. 61"

Peace be upon you, and the mercy of Allaah and His blessings. I received your letter telling me that you are 23 years old and that you are a Shi’a and a follower of Dawood Bohra, and that the representative of the leader of that group [the Bohra Shi’a] in Kenya is not allowing the official licensed to perform marriages in Mombasa to do your marriage contract, and you want to know the Islamic ruling on that.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There 
          is no doubt that the people in authority of all groups that claim to 
          be Muslim are obliged to adhere to the rulings of Islam in all affairs, 
          and that they should beware of anything that goes against that. It is 
          known in Islamic sharee’ah that guardians are obliged to arrange the 
          marriages of girls under their care if someone compatible proposes marriage, 
          because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And 
          marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who has no wife and 
          the woman who has no husband) and (also marry) the Saalihoon (pious, 
          fit and capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid servants (female 
          slaves). If they be poor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty. 
          And Allaah is All Sufficent for His creatures’ needs, All Knowing (about 
          the state of the people).”
[al-Noor 
          24:32]
And it was narrated that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If there comes to 
          you one with whose religious commitment and character you are pleased, 
          then marry [your female relative under your care] to him, for if you 
          do not do that then there will be fitnah (tribulation) on earth and 
          much mischief.” (Narrated by Imaam al-Tirmdihi and others).
 Based 
          on that, then if one of your guardians who is related to you arranges 
          your married to a compatible person, the representative of the Bohra 
          group has no right to object to that, and the marriage will be valid, 
          so long as the conditions of marriage are fulfilled. That should be 
          done through the sharee’ah court in Mombasa so that no objections can 
          be raised by the representative of the Bohra group. If the marriage 
          is done in the manner mentioned, then your children will be legitimate 
          and neither the Bohra group nor anybody else will be able to deny that. 
          If your relatives refuse to marry you to one who is compatible in order 
          to please the representative of the Bohra group, then their guardianship 
          becomes invalid thereby, and the Muslim judge (qaadi) has the right 
          to do the marriage contract for you with the compatible person who has 
          proposed marriage to you, because the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The ruler is the 
          wali for the one who has no wali.”
 The 
          qaadi is the deputy of the ruler and takes his place in such matters, 
          and if the wali (guardian) is refusing to arrange the girl’s marriage, 
          the ruling on him is the same as if he was not there at all. 
 But 
          we advise you and others in your position to forsake the Bohra madhhab 
          and other Shi’a madhhabs, because they go against the Islamic way of 
          Muhammad 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in many ways. So you have 
          to leave them and join the madhhab of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah who 
          follow that which is dictated by the Qur’aan and Sunnah and the way 
          of the early generations of this ummah, the Companions of the Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and those who follow them 
          in truth. I ask Allaah to guide this group and other groups which have 
          gone astray from the right path, and to show them the path of truth. 
          May He help you and us and all the Muslims to do that which will lead

So he prays, and does not know whether he is facing the qiblah or not. Is his prayer in such cases valid?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If a traveller who is on board a plane wants to pray a naafil prayer, then he can pray no matter what direction he is facing; he does not have to face the qiblah, because it was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray whilst riding his camel, no matter which direction it was facing, if he was travelling. But in the case of the obligatory prayers, it is essential to face the qiblah and to do rukoo’ and sujood if possible. So if a person is able to pray on board the plane, then he should do so. If the prayer which falls due whilst he is on the plane can be joined with another prayer later on, e.g., Zuhr, which he can delay and join with ‘Asr, or Maghrib which he can delay and join with ‘Isha’, he can do that. He has to ask the stewards about the direction of the qiblah if he is on board an airplane which does not have a sign to show the direction of the qiblah. If he does not do that, then his prayer is not valid.","Fataawa Fadeelat al-Shaykh Muhammad Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, for al-daw’ah magazine, issue # 1757, p. 45"

Is his behaviour permissible? Does Islam not say that the daytime is for seeking sustenance and the night for prayers?

There is no specific time for worship in general, but yes, praying qiyam (voluntary prayers) at night is better than praying during the day. This does not mean that there is no reward for praying nafil (extra) prayers during the day. He should start by doing that which is obligatory, whether the obligation is towards Allah or towards His creation, then he can use the rest of his time for doing that which is mustahabb (encouraged), and if he indulges in some permissible activities for the purpose of relaxation and recreation, that is OK.

The bank does not own the car or building, but the purchaser chooses it after signing the contract with the bank and agreeing to pay the installments, then the item being bought is handed over. The question is: is this transaction permissible, because we have heard from you and from other scholars, and we have read in the hadithh, that it is not permissible for a man to sell something unless he has taken possession of it. But in fact the bank does not take possession of this car or building; it does not buy it for itself, it is buying it for the purchaser who has asked for it specifically. They try to justify this by saying that the purchaser is not obliged to buy it if he changes his mind, but they know that he is determined to buy it, otherwise they would not have bought it.

This was also the view of the scholars among the companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Taabi’een.

See Da’eef Sunan al-Tirmidhi by al-Albaani, hadith no. 22 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: The imams are agreed that it is haraam to recite Quran when in a state of janaabah. 
It is not proper etiquette to recite Quran when one is in a state of janaabah because it is the words of Allah which must be respected and venerated, and kept away from all unclean places and places where haraam things take place, which could dishonour it and show disrespect towards its sanctity. Moreover the person who is in a state of janaabah can remove the impurity whenever he wants, so he is not allowed to recite Quran. But if you are impure in the sense of minor impurity then it is permissible for you to recite only, without touching the Mus-haf. See question no. 10672.

10995,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10995,Should We Recite al-Fatihah behind the Imam?,"My question relates to the correct manner of praying Farz salat behind an Imam, specifically the recital of surah Al-Fatihah.
1. Is it obligatory on us to quietly recite surah Al-Fatihah whilst the Imam recites it aloud, during the first and second rak`ah of a farz prayer?
2. Is it obligatory on us to recite the surah Al-Fatihah in the same situation but in the third and/or fourth rak`ah, ie., the Imam is silent in these rak`ahs?
This question arises due to our community's wish to correct our method of praying. There are two opinions amongst us, one being that when the Imam leads a prayer, whether he recites them aloud (1st and 2nd rak`ahs) or is silent (3rd and 4th rak`ahs) we must only listen; whilst others comment that without the recitation of surah Al-Fatihah, whether recited by the Imam or not, a prayer is not valid.
Please advise with as much factual evidence as possible.","Reciting al-Fatihah is one of the essential parts of the prayer. If you are following an imam, there are two scholarly opinions: 1- reciting al-Fatihah behind the imam is obligatory; 2- the recitation of the imam is also the recitation of the one who is praying behind him.",,"Praise be to Allah.Reciting al-Fatihah is one of the essential parts of the prayer, and is to be recited in each rak`ah both by the imam and by those who are being led by him, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no prayer for the one who does not recite the Opening of the Book [i.e., al-Fatihah].” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 714). 
With regard to one who is following an imam reciting al-Fatihah behind the imam in a prayer where Quran is to be recited out loud, there are two scholarly opinions. 

The first opinion is that it is obligatory, the evidence for that being the general meaning of the hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “There is no prayer for the one who does not recite the Opening of the Book [i.e., al-Fatihah].” And because when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught the one who had not prayed properly, he told him to recite al-Fatihah . 

It was narrated in a sahih report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite it in every rak`ah. Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Bari: “It was proven that permission was given to the one who is praying behind an imam to recite al-Fatihah in prayers in which Quran is to be recited out loud, without any exceptions. That is what was narrated by al-Bukhari in Juz al-Qira-ah, and by al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Hibban and others, from Makhul from Mahmud ibn al-Rabi’ from ‘Ubadah, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stumbled in his recitation in Fajr, and when he finished he said, “Perhaps you recite behind your imam?” They said, “Yes,” He said, “Do not do that, except for the Opening of the Book (al-Faithah), for there is no prayer for the one who does not recite it.” 

The second opinion is that the recitation of the imam is also the recitation of the one who is praying behind him. The evidence for that is the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): 

“So, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy” [al-A’raf 7:204]
Ibn Hajar said: “Those who say that (the one who is praying behind an imam) does not have to recite it in prayers where Quran is to be recited out loud, such as the Malikis, quote as evidence the hadith, ‘When he recites then listen attentively.’ This is a sahih hadith which was narrated by Muslim from Abu Musa al-‘Ash’ari.” 
Those who say that it is obligatory say that it should be recited after the imam has finished reciting al-Fatihah and before he starts to recite another surah, or that it should be recited when the imam pauses. Ibn Hajar said: “He should listen when the imam is reciting, and recite it when he is silent.” 
Shaykh Ibn Baz said, “What is meant by when the imam pauses is when he pauses during al-Fatihah or after reciting it, or in the surah that he recites after it. If the imam does not pause, then the one who is praying behind him has to recite al-Fatihah even if the imam is reciting, according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions.” (See Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, vol. 11, p. 221) 
The Standing Committee was asked a similar question and replied as follows: 
“The correct scholarly opinion is that it is obligatory to recite al-Fatihah when praying alone and it is obligatory upon the imam and those whom he is leading both in prayers where Quran is to be recited out loud and when it is to be recited silently, because of the soundness and specific nature of the texts which indicate that. The verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy” [al-A’raf 7:204] is general in meaning. The hadith, “When the Quran is recited then listen attentively” is general and applies both to al-Fatihah and other surahs. These two texts are general in meaning, and the following hadith refers to an exception to that rule: 
“There is no prayer for the one who does not recite the Opening of the Book.” Thus we may reconcile all the proven evidence. The hadith “The recitation of the imam is the recitation of the one who is praying behind him” is weak. It is not correct to say that the Amin of the congregation to the imam’s recitation of al-Fatihah takes the place of their own recitation. The differences of opinion among the scholars concerning this matter should not be taken as a means to hate one another, and to divide and turn our backs on one another. Rather you have to study the matter in more detail and find out more. If one of you is following a scholar who says that the one who is praying behind an imam has to recite al-Fatihah during prayers in which Quran is to be recited out loud, and others are following a scholar who says that they must be silent and listen to the imam in prayers where Quran is to be recited out loud, and that the imam’s recitation of al-Fatihah is sufficient, there is nothing wrong with that. There is no need for one group to denounce the other, or to hate one another because of that. 
They have to be open-minded about differences of opinion among the scholars, and about the reasons for that, and ask Allah to guide them in matters concerning which there are differences of opinion as to what is correct, for He is the All-Hearing, Ever-Responsive.
May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.”
