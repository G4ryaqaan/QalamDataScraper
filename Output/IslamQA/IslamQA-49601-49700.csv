49610,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49610,Can You Break a Voluntary Fast?,"If a person intends to observe a supererogatory fast, then he is invited to eat when visiting some relatives and he eats, is there any sin on him, or does he have to repeat that day so long as he intended to fast?",The Hadiths indicate that it is permissible for the one who is observing a voluntary fast to break it especially if he is invited to eat by a Muslim.,,"Praise be to Allah.If a Muslim intends to fast one day and starts to fast, then he wants to break that fast, he may do so, because completing a voluntary fast is not obligatory . But it is recommended for him to complete it if he has no reason for not doing so or no reason for breaking it; if there is a reason for breaking his fast there is no sin in doing so. 
This is indicated by a number of Hadiths, including the following: 

Muslim (1154) narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered upon me one day and said: “Do you have anything (any food)?” We said, “No.” He said, “Then I am fasting.” Then he came to us another day and we said, “O Messenger of Allah, we have been given some hays (a kind of food made from dates and ghee).” He said, “Show it to me, for I started the day fasting.” Then he ate. 

An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“This clearly supports the view of Ash-Shafi`i and those who agreed with him, that a supererogatory fast may be broken , and one may eat during the day and cancel the fast, because it is a voluntary fast, and the person has the choice whether to start it and continue it. Among those who were of this view are a number of the Companions, Ahmad, Ishaq and others, but all of them (may Allah have mercy on them), and Ash-Shafi`i too, agreed that it is recommended to complete the fast. Abu Hanifah and Malik (may Allah have mercy on them) said that it is not permissible to break the fast and doing so is a sin. This is also the view of Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Makhul and An-Nakh`i (may Allah have mercy on them); they said that it is obligatory for the one who breaks the fast without an excuse to make it up. Ibn `Abd Al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: They unanimously agreed that the one who has an excuse for breaking the fast does not have to make it up. And Allah knows best.” 

Ahmad (26353) narrated from Umm Hani’ (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered upon her and called for something to drink, and drank some, then he passed it to her and she drank some. She said: “O Messenger of Allah, I was fasting.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who is observing a voluntary fast is his own master; if he wishes he may (continue to) fast and if he wishes he may break his fast.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami`, 3854) 

It says in Tuhfat Al-Ahwadhi, commenting on this Hadith: 
“The Hadiths on this topic indicate that it is permissible for the one who is observing a voluntary fast to break it, especially if he is invited to eat by a Muslim .” 

Al-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Some food was made for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and when it was served a man said: “I am fasting.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Your brother has invited you and made this effort for you. Break your fast and make it up later if you wish.” Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Its chain of narration is good.”

49614,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49614,Can You Sleep Beside Your Wife while Fasting?,Is it permissible for a man to sleep beside his wife in Ramadan?,"It is permissible for a man to sleep beside his wife in Ramadan. In fact, it is permissible for a man to be intimate with his wife when he is fasting, so long as no intercourse or ejaculation takes place.",,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, it is permissible for a man to sleep beside his wife in Ramadan. In fact, it is permissible for a man to be intimate with his wife when he is fasting , so long as no intercourse or ejaculation takes place. 
Al-Bukhari (1927) and Muslim (1106) narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to kiss and be intimate when fasting, and he was the most able of you to control his desire.” 
Al-Sindi said: 
“The word yubashir (translated here as “be intimate”) means touching the wife’s skin and her touching him, such as putting his cheek against hers and so on.” 
What is meant here is touching the skin, not intercourse . 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
What is it permissible for a man who is fasting to do with his wife who is fasting?
 He replied: 
“A man who is observing an obligatory fast is not permitted to do anything with his wife that will lead to ejaculation . People vary in how quickly they reach climax; some of them are slow and can control themselves completely, as `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said concerning the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “he was the most able of you to control his desire.” Some of them cannot control themselves and ejaculate quickly. Such a person should not be intimate with his wife and touch her or kiss her, etc. when observing an obligatory fast. If a person knows that he can control himself, then he can kiss and hug his wife even when observing an obligatory fast, but he must beware of intercourse because having intercourse (during the day) in Ramadan for one who is obliged to fast results in five things: 

It is a sin
The fast is invalidated
He should refrain from eating, etc. for the rest of the day. Everyone who breaks his fast in Ramadan with no legitimate Shar`i excuse has to refrain from eating etc. (for the rest of the day) and also has to make up that day.
He has to make up that day because he forfeited an obligatory act of worship, which he has to make up.
He has to offer an expiation which is one of the most burdensome of expiations: freeing a slave; if he cannot do that then he must fast for two consecutive months; if he cannot do that then he must feed sixty poor persons.

If it is an obligatory fast that was being observed at a time other than Ramadan – such as making up a day missed in Ramadan, or observing an expiatory fast etc., then breaking the fast results in two things: sin and having to make it up.  But if it was a voluntary fast and he has intercourse during it, then he does not have to do anything.

49615,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49615,He wants his wife to break her fast and make it up later for no reason,"Fate decreed that the first week of Ramadaan should be the week of my marriage, and my husband cannot control his desire, but I do not want to break the fast. 
My husband says that it does not matter if I break the fast for one day and make it up later.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Saying “fate decreed” is not correct, because the One Who wills and decrees is Allaah, the One, the Subduer, may He be glorified and exalted. We have already discussed this in the answer to question no. 8621. 
Secondly: 
Breaking the fast in Ramadaan for no reason is a major sin, and the one who does it is a faasiq (rebellious evildoer) who has to repent to Allaah from this major sin. 
It was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) issued a stern warning to the one who breaks the fast in Ramadaan for no reason. 
Al-Haakim narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw the punishment of the one who breaks the fast in Ramadaan for no reason, He said: “We saw some people hung up by their Achilles tendons, with the corners of their mouths torn and pouring with blood. I said, ‘Who are these?’ He said: ‘These are the people who broke their fast before it was permissible for them to do so.’” 
Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 3951. 
Based on this, this husband has to fear Allaah and not take the matter of fasting lightly, for it is a serious matter. 
You should not obey him in this matter, for there is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator. 
Breaking the fast in Ramadaan and making it up later on is only prescribed for those who break the fast for a legitimate reason such as sickness, traveling etc. But if a Muslim breaks the fast in Ramadaan for no reason, he exposes himself to the wrath and punishment of Allaah. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound. 
See also question no.  38747. 
Thirdly: 
Intercourse is one of the things that break the fast, and it is one of the most serious of such things in terms of sin. Hence kafaarah (expiation) must be offered for it. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Fataawa al-Siyaam (p. 337): 
The one who has intercourse during the day in Ramadaan when he is fasting and is not traveling has to offer a burdensome expiation, which is freeing a slave; if he cannot do that then he must fast for two consecutive months; and if he cannot do that then he must feed sixty poor persons. The same applies to the woman if she was willing, but if she was forced then she does not have to do anything. If they were traveling then there is no sin on them and they do not have to offer any expiation, and they do not have to refrain from eating for the rest of the day, but they do have to make up that day, because fasting is not obligatory for them (as they are traveling). If a person had intercourse when he was fasting in his own country and was one of those who are obliged to fast, five things result from that: 
1-It is a sin
2-The fast is invalidated
3-He has to refrain from eating etc for the rest of the day
4-He has to make up the fast
5-He has to offer expiation.
The evidence for that is the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: Whilst we were sitting with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), a man came and said, “O Messenger of Allaah, I am doomed!” He said: “What is the matter with you?” He said, “I had intercourse with my wife when I was fasting.” The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do you have a slave whom you can set free?” He said, “No.” He said: “Can you fast for two consecutive months?” He said, “No.” He said, “Can you afford to feed sixty poor persons?” He said, “No.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) fell silent for a while, and whilst we were like that, a basket of dates was brought to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He said: “Where is the one who was asking?’ He said, “Here I am.” He said: ‘Take this and give it in charity.” The man said: “To someone poorer than me? O Messenger of Allaah, there is no family between the two lava fields (i.e., in Madeenah) poorer than mine.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) smiled until his eyeteeth became visible, then he said: “Feed it to your family.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1936; Muslim, 1111. 
If this man cannot fast or feed the poor, then the obligation to offer expiation is waived, because Allaah does not burden any soul beyond its scope, and there is no obligation if one is unable to do it. It makes no difference whether there was any ejaculation or not, so long as intercourse has taken place. This is unlike the case when ejaculation takes place without intercourse, for which no expiation is due, rather this is a sin, and the person must refrain from eating etc for the rest of the day, and make the day up. 
He was also asked about a man who forces his wife to have intercourse during the day in Ramadaan, and replied: 
It is haraam for her to obey her husband or to allow him to do that in this case, because she is observing an obligatory fast. She has to resist him as much as possible. It is haraam for her husband to have intercourse with her in this case, but if she cannot stop him then there is no sin on her, and she does not have to make up the day or offer any expiation, because she was forced to do it.

Delaying making up missed fasts


Fidyah for missed fasts","Praise be to Allah.Making up missed fasts due to menstruation
When a woman does not fast because of her period, she has to make up the days that she missed , because ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “That – meaning menstruation – used to happen to us and we were told to make up the fasts but we were not told to make up the prayers.” (Narrated by Muslim, 335) 
Delaying making up missed fasts
We have already stated in another answer that it is obligatory to make up days missed in Ramadan before the next Ramadan comes ; it is not permissible to delay it except for those who have a valid reason. 
Fidyah for missed fasts
Whoever is obliged to make up missed fasts but then is unable to do so because of sickness or weakness for which there is no hope of a cure should feed the poor instead, one poor person for each day.
 Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin was asked in Fatawa Arkan al-Islam (p. 455): 
A young girl got her period and she fasted the days of her period out of ignorance. What does she have to do? 
He replied: 
She has to make up the days that she fasted during her period, because fasts observed whilst menstruating are not accepted and are not valid, even if she was ignorant of that, and there is no limit to the time when they can be made up. 
Here is a case which involves the opposite scenario: A woman started her periods when she was young, and she was too shy to tell her family, and she did not fast Ramadan. This woman has to make up the month that she did not fast, because once a woman starts her periods she becomes mukallafah (accountable for her deeds), because menstruation is one of the signs of having reached adolescence.”  
He was also asked about a woman who did not make up the days from her period in Ramadan until she owed nearly two hundred days, and now she is sick and old and cannot fast – what should she do? 
He replied: 
“If this woman will be harmed by fasting as mentioned in the question, because she is elderly and sick, then she should feed one poor person for each day. She should calculate how many days she owes from the past and feed one poor person for each day.” (Fatawa al-Siyam, p. 121) 
For information on how much must be given when feeding the poor, please see question no. 38867 . 
In conclusion, if you are able to fast, then you have to make up the days. If you will not be able to fast, then you have to feed one poor person for each day. Try to figure out how many days you did not fast until you think it most likely that you have reached the right number.

49632,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49632,The Difference between Zakah on Wealth and Zakat Al-Fitr,Is the Zakah that is enjoined on Muslims and is one of the five pillars something other than the Zakah of Ramadan?,"Zakah on wealth is one of the five pillars of Islam. Whoever denies it is a disbeliever and whoever withholds it is a rebellious evildoer. Zakat Al-Fitr is not one of the pillars of Islam, and the one who denies it is not a disbeliever.",,"Praise be to Allah.Zakah, which is one of the five pillars of Islam is something other than the Zakah that must be paid at the end of Ramadan (Zakat Al-fitr). 
The former is Zakah on wealth which is only obligatory on certain kinds of wealth , namely: 

Livestock (camels, cattle and sheep)
Gold and silver and, nowadays, paper currency
Trade goods
What is produced by the earth, which includes two things:


Crops and fruits. The scholars unanimously agreed that it is obligatory to pay Zakah on four kinds: wheat, barley, dates and raisins; they differed with regard to other kinds.
Rikaz (buried treasure), i.e., wealth of the disbelievers buried in the ground that is found by a Muslim.

Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (25/10) that Ibn Al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The scholars unanimously agreed that Zakah is obligatory on nine things: camels, cattle, sheep, gold, silver, wheat, barley, dates and raisins, if they reach the Nisab (minimum threshold) for each type at which Zakah becomes due. They differed with regard to other types of wealth. 
Zakah for each of these kinds of wealth is obligatory subject to certain conditions, and a specific amount of the wealth must be given as defined by Shari`ah.” 
This Zakah (on wealth) is one of the five pillars of Islam. Whoever denies it is a disbeliever and whoever withholds it is a rebellious evildoer; the Muslim ruler must take it from him by force. If he persists in withholding it and is protected by his tribe then he must be fought until he pays it. 
Al-Bukhari (8) and Muslim (12) narrated that `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Islam is founded on five (pillars): bearing witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, establishing regular prayer, paying Zakah, fasting Ramadan and going on Pilgrimage to the House.” 
Al-Bukhari (25) and Muslim (22) narrated from Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have been commanded to fight the people until they bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and they establish regular prayer, and pay Zakah. If they do that, then they have protected their blood and wealth from me except in cases where Islamic laws apply, and their reckoning will be with Allah.”  
The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) unanimously agreed on fighting those who withheld Zakah. Al-Bukhari (1400) and Muslim (20) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed away, and Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) became caliph, and some of the Arabs disbelieved and apostatized, `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: `How could you fight the people, when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “I have been commanded to fight the people until they bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah. Whoever says that has protected his blood and wealth from me except in cases where Islamic laws apply, and their reckoning will be with Allah”?’ Then Abu Bakr said: `By Allah, I will fight those who differentiate between prayer and Zakah, for Zakah is what is due on wealth. By Allah, if they withhold from me a small sheep that they used to give to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), I will fight them for withholding it.’ `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: `By Allah, when I saw how confident Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) was about this, I realized that this was the truth.’” 
With regard to the Zakah that is obligatory at the end of Ramadan, this is Zakat Al-Fitr . The scholars unanimously agreed that it is obligatory, except those who held odd views. (See Tarh At-Tathrib, 4/46) 
It is less important than the Zakah of wealth with regard to obligation and status. Zakat Al-Fitr is not one of the pillars of Islam, and the one who denies it is not a disbeliever. 
Zakat Al-Fitr was mentioned in many prophetic narrations, such as the following: 

Al-Bukhari (1503) and Muslim (984) narrated that Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined Zakat Al-fitr, one Sa` of dates, or one Sa` of barley, for every Muslim, slave or free, male or female, young or old, and he enjoined that it be given before the people go out to the prayer (on `Eid). 
Abu Dawud (1609) narrated that Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined Zakat Al-fitr as a purification for those who fasted from idle or obscene talk, and so as to feed the poor. Whoever gives it before the prayer, it is accepted Zakah and whoever gives it after the prayer, it is ordinary charity. (Classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud).

He replied: 
“Kohl does not break the fast for women or for men, according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, but it is better to use it at night for one who is fasting.

I know that it is permissible to taste things whilst fasting, if you make sure that none of the drink enters the body. 
When I taste the coffee I try very hard to make sure that I do not swallow any amount, not even a small amount. But tasting coffee leaves a taste and smell in the mouth. Does tasting coffee whilst fasting invalidate the fast?",There is nothing wrong with tasting food while fasting and it does not affect the fast so long as none of the food enters the throat of the fasting person. This applies equally to coffee and other things.,,"Praise be to Allah.If a fasting person needs to taste food whilst fasting , there is nothing wrong with that, and it does not affect the fast so long as none of the food enters the throat of the fasting person.

Ibn 'Abbas said: 
“There is nothing wrong with tasting what is being cooked or whatever.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari in a mu’allaq report)
Imam Ahmad said: 
“I prefer that he should avoid tasting food, but if he does that it will not affect him and there is nothing wrong with that.” (Al-Mughni, 4/359)
Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said in al-Fatawa al-Kubra (4/474): 
“Tasting food is makruh if there is no need to do that, but it does not break the fast.” 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin was asked in Fatawa al-Siyaam (p. 356): Is the fast invalidated by tasting food?  
He replied: 
“The fast is not invalidated by tasting food so long as one does not swallow it, but you should not do that unless there is a need for it; in that case if a little of it reaches your stomach by accident your fast is not invalidated.” 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah (10/332): 
“There is nothing wrong with a person tasting food during the day when fasting, when there is a need to do that, and his fast is valid if he does not deliberately swallow any of it.
If the taste or smell remains, that does not affect the fast, so long as you do not deliberately swallow anything.” 
Ibn Sirin said: 
“There is nothing wrong with using a wet siwak – i.e., when fasting. It was said: It has a flavour. He said: And water has a flavour, but you rinse your mouth with it. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (3/261): 
“It is makruh to taste food such as dates, bread and soup, unless there is a need to do that, in which case it is OK.” 
The reason for that is that some of this food may go down into the stomach without a person realizing, so tasting this food exposes him to spoiling the fast. Also he may be desiring the food a great deal, so he tastes it in order to enjoy it, and he may swallow it, then some of it goes down into his stomach. 
Examples of necessity are when a cook needs to see how salty or sweet the food is, and so on.” 
Based on this, there is nothing wrong with tasting the coffee when you are fasting, because you need to do that. But you have to be very cautious and make sure that nothing reaches your stomach.

49666,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49666,"He married her on the basis that he would come back to his country after a certain amount of time, then he decided not to go back","A man came to propose marriage to me, and he was working in another country. He agreed with my father that I would travel with him after marriage and stay there with him for no more than three years, and we would come back together after that time was up. I actually did marry him and I traveled with him, and I have two children. Three years went by, and when I asked him to go back, based on the agreement, he went mad and told me that he will never go back; he has migrated and I have to accept this situation. In addition to that, he is a man who does not help me to obey Allaah. He brought a satellite dish into our home and he leaves me alone all day feeling lonely in this foreign land, and I cannot resist watching it. Also, he does not allocate any time to spend with me and relieve my loneliness. All his time is spent at his work or with his friends. When I realized that I could not stand to put up with this situation for the rest of my life, I decided to go back to Egypt and never come back and delegate my affairs to Allaah with regard to this bad marriage.  But the problem is that he is accusing me of being a wife who does not obey him and of being disobedient, and he tells me that Allaah will punish me on the Day of Resurrection because I went against my husband’s commands.

 Am I really a disobedient wife, or does the fact that he did not adhere to the agreement on the basis of which I married him exonerate me from any blame?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    The Muslim is obliged to adhere to the conditions that he set 
    and to fulfil his promises. Among the conditions that are most deserving of 
    fulfillment are those by means of which it becomes permissible for a man to 
    enjoy intimacy with his wife, namely the conditions of marriage. 
Al-Bukhaari (2821) and 
    Muslim (1418) narrated that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The conditions that most deserve to 
    be fulfilled are those by means of which it becomes permissible for you to 
    enjoy intimacy.” 

    Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (7/448): 

    The conditions of marriage fall into three categories: 

    1 – Those which must be fulfilled, which are those which 
    benefit the wife, such as the condition that he will not make her leave her 
    house or city, or make her travel with him (i.e., take her to another 
    country). 

    These must be fulfilled. If the husband does not do that then 
    the wife has the right to annul the marriage, because the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The conditions that most 
    deserve to be fulfilled are those by means of which it becomes permissible 
    for you to enjoy intimacy.” End quote. 

    It is essential to differentiate between that which the 
    husband stated as a condition in the marriage, and a promise that he made 
    after the marriage contract was done. If it was a condition of marriage 
    (i.e., the marriage contract was done on the basis of this condition), then 
    the wife has the choice of waiving that condition or of annulling the 
    marriage, if her husband does not fulfil this condition. In this case she 
    should be given her rights in full. 

    If it was a promise that he made after marriage, then he has 
    to fulfil his promise if he does not have an excuse. But the wife does not 
    have the right to annul the marriage if he does not fulfil it. This is the 
    ruling on this situation. 

    We advise the husband to fulfil the condition and to keep his 
    promise, or to ask for his wife’s consent to waive the condition or to delay 
    fulfillment of the promise until a later, stated time. He has to fear Allaah 
    with regard to his wife and not bring haraam things and haraam entertainment 
    into the house. 

    The sister who asked this question should be more patient and 
    put up with it. She should also try to get wise people from her family and 
    from his to intervene, in order to resolve the differences between them. 

    Secondly:  

    The husband has made a serious mistake by bringing the 
    satellite dish into the home and enabling his wife to see all the sinful 
    content that the dish brings. The one whom Allaah has put in charge of 
    others should be sincere towards them and not be negligent or heedless in 
    his duties towards them. 

    Thirdly: 

    The sister made a mistake, because she is not forced to look 
    at the evil scenes brought by the dish, and her being alone is no excuse. 
    She can occupy herself by worshipping Allaah, keeping company with righteous

What should I do?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.You do not have to make them up; it is sufficient for you to act upon what you think is most likely. 
Acting on the basis of what you think most likely with regard to acts of worship is something that was narrated in sharee’ah. For example, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If any one of you is uncertain about his prayer (i.e., how many rak’ahs he has prayed), let him think what is most likely to be the case and complete the prayer on that basis, then say the tasleem, then prostrate twice.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 401; Muslim, 572. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
This is evidence (that supports the view of) Abu Haneefah – may Allah have mercy on him – and those who agreed with him among the people of Kufa and others of ahl al-ra’y, that whoever is uncertain of how many rak’ahs he has done in his prayer should act on the basis of what he thinks is most likely to be the case; he does not have to limit himself to the lower amount and do more. The apparent meaning of this hadith is their evidence. End quote. 
Shaykh al-Islam confirmed in Majmoo’ al-Fatawa (23/5-16) that this hadith refers to acting upon what one thinks is most likely the case. He regarded as weak the view of some scholars, that what is meant by acting upon what one is certain of is to act upon the smaller number, such as if a person is unsure as to whether he has prayed two rak’ahs or three, he should assume it is two. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in his book Manzoomaat fi Qawaa’id al-Fiqh wa Usoolihi: 
If you cannot be certain, than refer to what you think is most likely to be the case, then you will be following the right course. 
What this means is that if a person cannot act on the basis of certainty, then he should act on the basis of what he thinks is most likely the case. 
If you think it is most likely that you made up those days, then you do not have to do anything; you do not have to make up these days again. 
If a woman is not sure whether she made up the days that she owes or not, and neither seems more likely to her to be the case, then she has to make them up. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked in Fataawa al-Siyaam (p. 372): If a woman does not fast some days in Ramadaan, but she forget whether she fasted those days or not, and all she remembers is that she only has one day left, should she fast those days again or act on the basis of what she is certain about? 
He replied: 
If she is not certain that she has one day left, then she only has to fast one day, but if she is certain that she only has to fast one day, but she is not sure whether she fasted it or not, then she has to fast it, because the basic principle is that she still owes it, and if she has not discharged her duty then she still has to fast it. This is unlike the case of one who is uncertain as to whether she has one day or two to fast; she only has to fast one day. But if she knows that she has to fast one or more days, but she is not sure whether she fasted them or not, then she has to fast it, because the basic principle is that she still has to fast it.",Islam Q&A

    Undoubtedly your husband – according to what you say – has 
    fallen into a great fitnah (trial, temptation), and there is the fear that 
    if he persists in this he may give up prayer and the good things that he is 
    now doing, because the fitnah of looking at haraam things may lead to bad 
    consequences for the religious commitment and morals of the sinner. 

    Looking is the basis for all the problems that befall a man, 
    because looking generates thoughts, then thoughts generate ideas, then ideas 
    generate desires, then desires generate will, which develops into resolve, 
    then the action is done, and it is inevitable if there is nothing to stop 
    it. Hence it is said that patience in lowering one's gaze is easier than 
    patience in bearing the pain of what comes after that.

We have already outlined 
    in the answer to question no. 22917 
    the benefits of lowering one’s gaze, which include the fact that lowering 
    one's gaze is obedience to the command of Allaah and it purifies one’s 
    heart, soul and actions. It also prevents the poisoned arrow from having any 
    effect, for a glance is one of the poisoned arrows of Iblees. And the one 
    who lowers his gaze is compensated with the sweetness of faith in the heart. 
    It frees the heart from being controlled by desires, because the real 
    prisoner is the one who is controlled by his desires. 

    The answer to question no.
    20229 lists some of the ways that 
    help one to lower the gaze, such as: remembering that Allaah is always 
    watching you, seeking the help of Allaah, beseeching Him and praying to Him, 
    striving to control one’s nafs and get used to lowering the gaze and being 
    patient in doing so.

    23425 mentions some of the effects 
    that sin has on the one who commits it. These include: 

    Deprivation of knowledge, deprivation of provision, the fear 
    that the sinner may become alienated from his Lord and from people, his 
    affairs may become difficult, the sinner may find darkness in his soul, he 
    may be deprived of obedience – for sin leads to more of the same, and 
    weakens a person’s will to worship Allaah, and increases his will to commit 
    sin; it gradually weakens his will to repent until the will to repent 
    disappears from his heart completely. Then any feeling of abhorrence towards 
    sin disappears from his heart and it becomes habitual for him, and he does 
    not care if people see him or speak about him.

    We would also like to say two more things to our brother: 

    1 – He should seek Allaah’s help to obey Him and ask Him to 
    help him get rid of this problem. Shaykh Muhammad al-‘Uthaymeen was asked 
    about someone who had this problem and he replied: 
This man who is 
    suffering with this problem – we ask Allaah to guide him – is undoubtedly 
    doing something haraam, for a glance is one of the arrows of Iblees – we 
    seek refuge with Allaah. How often has a glance brought trouble to a 
    person’s heart and he has become a prisoner to it. How often has a glance 
    affected a person’s heart so much that he has become a prisoner of an image. 
    Hence if a person is affected by this problem, he has to turn to Allaah and 
    ask him to heal him of that. He has to turn away from it and not lift his 
    gaze to any woman or any beardless youth. At the same time he has to seek 
    the help of Allaah and turn to Him, and ask Him to keep him safe from this 
    disease. Then it will be lifted from him, if Allaah wills.

    Among the du’aa’s that are appropriate in this situation is 
    the following: 

    It was narrated that Shakl ibn Humayd said: I came to the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: “O 
    Prophet of Allaah, teach me a prayer for refuge with which I may seek 
    refuge.” He took my hand and said: “Say: ‘A’oodhu bika min sharri sam’i 
    wa sharri baasri wa sharri lisaani wa sharri qalbi wa sharri maniyi (I 
    seek refuge with You from the evil of my hearing, the evil of my sight, the 
    evil of my tongue, the evil of my heart and the evil of my sexual 
    desires),’” until I had memorized it.

    1551. classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
2 – He should realize 
    that his life may end with his evil deeds. Allaah may take his soul when he 
    is looking at something that Allaah has forbidden him to look at, so in what 
    state will he be on the Day when Allaah raises people from their graves? How 
    will he meet his Lord when his life ended in such a way?

    affairs straight and to guide him.

How should I fast in Ramadaan, and how should I pray?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The ruling depends on the reason for it; if the reason is present, the ruling applies. If there is menstrual blood which is known by its characteristics and colour, then the woman must follow the rulings on menstruation, and prayer, fasting and intercourse are forbidden at that time, even if it happens more than once in a month and even if it lasts more than the usual number of days each month. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about a woman whose period came, then she became pure and did ghusl, then after she had prayed for nine days, she started to bleed again, so she did not pray for three days, then she became pure and prayed for eleven days, then her period came again as usual. Should she repeat the prayers she offered during those three days or should they be regarded as part of her period? 
He replied: 
When the period comes it is hayd (menstruation) regardless of whether a long time or a short one has passed between it and the previous period. If a woman has her period then becomes pure, then after five days, or six, or ten, her period comes again, she should stop praying because this is hayd. This applies all the time. Every time she becomes pure then her period comes again, she has to stop praying etc. But if she bleeds continually and it only stops for a short while, then she is mustahaadah (one who suffers from istihaadah or non-menstrual vaginal bleeding), and in that case she should only stop praying for the duration of her normal menses.

So it is not permissible to follow such hadiths or to act upon them, whether that is in doing righteous deeds or otherwise. For more, please see the detailed answer.","15th of Sha`ban: Any recommended worship?


Can Muslims act upon weak hadiths about good deeds?","Praise be to Allah.15th of Sha`ban: Any recommended worship?
What is narrated concerning the virtue of praying, fasting and worshipping on the fifteenth of Sha'ban (al-Nisf min Sha’ban) does not come under the heading of da’if (weak), rather it comes under the heading of mawdu’ (fabricated) and batil (false). So it is not permissible to follow it or to act upon it, whether that is in doing righteous deeds or otherwise.
A number of scholars ruled that the reports concerning that were false, such as Ibn al-Jawzi in his book al-Mawdu’at, 2/440-445; Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah in al-Manar al-Munif, no. 174- 177; Abu Shamah al-Shaafi’i in al-Ba’ith ‘ala Inkar al-Bida’ wa’l-Hawadith, 124-137; al-'Iraqi in Takhrij Ihya ‘Uloom il-Din, no. 582. Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] narrated that there was consensus on the fact that they are false, in Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 28/138.
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Hukm al-Ihtifal bi Laylat al-Nisf min Sha’ban (Ruling on celebrating the fifteenth of Sha'ban):
“Celebrating the night of the fifteenth of Sha'ban (Laylat al-Nisf min Sha’ban) by praying etc, or singling out this day for fasting, is a reprehensible bid’ah (innovation) according to the majority of scholars, and there is no basis for this in Shari’ah.”
And he (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“There is no sahih hadith concerning the night of the fifteenth of Sha'ban (Laylat al-Nisf min Sha’ban). All the ahadith that have been narrated concerning that are mawdu’ (fabricated) and da’if (weak), and have no basis. There is nothing special about this night, and no recitation of Quran or prayer, whether alone or in congregation, is specified for this night. What some of the scholars have said about it being special is a weak opinion. It is not permissible to single it out for any special actions. This is the correct view. And Allah is the Source of strength.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 4/511)
Can Muslims act upon weak hadiths about good deeds?
Even if we assume that the hadith is da’if (weak) and not mawdu’ (fabricated), the correct scholarly view is that weak ahadith should not be followed at all, even if they speak of righteous deeds or of targhib and tarhib (promises and warnings). The sahih reports are sufficient and the Muslim has no need to follow the da’if reports. Nothing is known in Islam to suggest that this night or day is special, either from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or from his Companions.
The scholar Ahmad Shakir said: “There is no difference between rulings or righteous deeds; we do not take any of them from da’if reports, rather no one has the right to use any report as evidence unless it is proven to be soundly narrated from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in a sahih or hasan hadith.” (Al-Ba'ith al-Hathith, 1/278)

    7222. This ruling 
    applies equally to images of anything that has a soul, whether it is a human 
    being or an animal. 

    Based on that, with regard to the ruling on selling these 
    pictures and images, there is no doubt that if it is haraam to manufacture 
    them and keep them, it is also haraam to buy and sell them. It is proven in
    al-Saheehayn and elsewhere that it was narrated from Jaabir ibn 
    ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he heard the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say in the year of 
    the Conquest when he was in Makkah: “Allaah and His Messenger have forbidden 
    the sale of alcohol, dead meat, pork and idols.” It was said: “O Messenger 
    of Allaah, what about the fat from dead meat (i.e., from animals that have 
    died of natural causes)? For it is used to caulk ships and to grease hides, 
    and people use it in their lamps.” He said: “No, it is haraam.” Then the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “May Allaah curse the Jews, for when Allaah forbade animal fat, they 
    rendered it and sold it, and consumed its price.” Al-Bukhaari, 2236; Muslim, 
    1581. 

    Al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    This hadeeth indicates that whatever we are forbidden to eat 
    or make use of, it is not permissible to sell it or to consume its price. 

    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This 
    indicates that if a thing is forbidden in and of itself, its price is also 
    forbidden. 

    What al-Qaadi and Ibn Hajar mentioned is also proven in a 
    version of this hadeeth that was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him), at the end of which it says: “When Allaah forbids eating a 
    thing, He also forbids its price.” [Musnad Ahmad, no. 2223]. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: Is 
    it permissible for a Muslim to sell statues and make a living from that? 

    He replied: 

    It is not permissible for a Muslim to deal in statues, 
    because it is proven in the saheeh ahaadeeth that it is haraam to make 
    images or statues of animate beings at all or to keep them. Undoubtedly 
    dealing in them means that one is propagating them and helping others to 
    make images and set them up in homes, clubs and so on.  

    If that is haraam, then income earned by selling them is also 
    haraam. It is not permissible for a Muslim to make a living from that or to 
    buy food or clothing with that money. If a person does that then he must get 
    rid of that money and repent to Allaah, and Allaah will accept his 
    repentance. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, 
    believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does 
    righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them (till his 
    death)”

    [Ta-Ha 20:82]
We have issued a fatwa 
    stating that it is haraam to make images of any animate beings, whether the 
    images are three-dimensional or not, and whether they are made by carving, 
    copying, drawing or with a camera.

Whoever has wealth that he wants to save or invest should look for a permissible way of doing so. He may give the money to a trustworthy man to do business with it for him, and they can share the profit in whatever manner they agree upon. 
If he cannot find any way to save it other than depositing it in the bank, then there is no sin in that if it is done out of necessity, so long as that does not involve any interest. 
He should choose the least evil of the banks, and the one that is closest to the way of dealing that is prescribed in sharee’ah. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
With regard to depositing money in bank accounts that pay interest monthly or annually, this is a kind of riba that is forbidden according to scholarly consensus. With regard to depositing it without interest, it is better not to do that except in cases of necessity if the bank deals with interest, because depositing money with the bank, even if no interest is paid, helps the bank to engage in its riba-based transactions, so there is the fear that the one who does this may come under the heading of those who help others in sin and transgression, even if he does not intend to do so. We must beware of that which Allaah has forbidden and look for sound ways of preserving and disposing of wealth. May Allaah help the Muslims to do that which will lead to their happiness and victory and salvation. May He help them to quickly establish Islamic banks that are free of riba, for He is Able to do that. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.

Vitamins and hormones, and food and drink in general, should be consumed during the night. If the effects last all day whilst fasting, that is something that is permissible. What is forbidden is to do that during the day from dawn until sunset. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your Sawm (fast) till the nightfall” [Al-Baqarah 2:187]
Islam encourages us to eat sahoor, which is to be delayed until the end of the night, because that helps the fasting person to fast.

    warning in this verse was addressed to those who like immorality to be 
    propagated, so how about one who actually works to make that happen and 
    become widespread? 

    This is the way that is known to end in what we see and hear 
    and read about those who use these means to approach the opposite sex. How 
    many men have lost their religious commitment and how many women have lost 
    their honour? Some of them have found no other way but suicide to escape

Why is pork haram?


Scientific and medical reasons for prohibiting pork","Praise be to Allah.Importance of accepting the rules of Shari`ah
The basic principle for the Muslim is that he obeys whatever Allah enjoins upon him, and refrains from whatever He forbids him, whether the reason behind that is clear or not. 
It is not permissible for a Muslim to reject any ruling of Shari’ah or to hesitate to follow it if the reason behind it is not clear. Rather he must accept the rulings on halal and haram when they are proven in the text, whether he understands the reason behind that or not. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed into a plain error.” [al-Ahzab 33:36] 
“The only saying of the faithful believers, when they are called to Allah (His Words, the Quran) and His Messenger, to judge between them, is that they say: ‘We hear and we obey.’ And such are the successful (who will live forever in Paradise).” [al-Nur 24:51]
Why is pork haram?
Pork is forbidden in Islam according to the text of the Quran, where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He has forbidden you only the Maytah (dead animals), and blood, and the flesh of swine…” [al-Baqarah 2:173]
It is not permissible for a Muslim to consume it under any circumstances except in cases of necessity where a person’s life depends on eating it, such as in the case of starvation where a person fears that he is going to die, and he cannot find any other kind of food, based on the shar’i principle: “In cases of necessity, haram things are permitted.” 
There is no mention in the Shar’i texts of a specific reason for the prohibition on pork, apart from the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “for that surely, is impure” [al-An'am 6:145]. 
The word rijs (translated here as ‘impure’) is used to refer to anything that is regarded as abhorrent in Islam and according to the sound human nature (fitrah). This reason alone is sufficient. 
And there is a general reason which is given with regard to the prohibition on haram food and drink and the like, which points to the reason behind the prohibition on pork. This general reason is to be found in the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He [i.e., the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] allows them as lawful At-Tayyibat (i.e. all good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), and prohibits them as unlawful Al-Khabaith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods).” [al-A'raf 7:157]
The general meaning of this verse includes the reason for the prohibition on pork and it may be understood that in the Islamic viewpoint, it is included among the list of things that are evil and unlawful (al-khabaith). 
What is meant by al-khabaith here is all things that will harm a person’s health, wealth or morals. Everything that leads to negative consequences in one of these important aspects of a person’s life comes under the general heading of khabaith. 
Scientific and medical reasons for prohibiting pork
Scientific and medical research has also proven that the pig, among all other animals, is regarded as a carrier of germs that are harmful to the human body. Explaining all these harmful diseases in detail would take too long, but in brief we may list them as: parasitic diseases, bacterial diseases, viruses and so on.  
These and other harmful effects indicate that the Wise Lawgiver has only forbidden pork for a reason, which is to preserve life and health, which are among the five basic necessities which are protected by Shari’ah.

49693,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49693,He broke wind whilst doing ghusl from janaabah; is his ghusl invalidated?,"If a person passes wind whilst doing ghusl from janaabah, does that invalidate the ghusl?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Passing wind is one of the things that invalidate wudoo’ but 
    it is not one of the things that invalidate ghusl. Based on this, if a 
    person touches his private part, urinates or passes wind whilst doing ghusl, 
    he should complete his ghusl, then do wudoo’ afterwards. 

    The basic principle is that if ghusl is done following major 
    impurity, then it suffices for wudoo’. If a person is junub (impure 
    following sexual activity) and he does ghusl, then that suffices for wudoo’, 
    because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“If you are in a state of 
    Janaaba (i.e. after a sexual discharge), purify yourselves (bathe your whole 
    body)”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:6]

    He does not have to do wudoo’ after doing ghusl, but if one 
    of the things that invalidate wudoo’ takes place whilst doing ghusl or 
    afterwards, then he has to do wudoo’ for prayer. But if he does not break 
    his wudoo’ then his ghusl from janaabah suffices for wudoo’, whether he did 
    wudoo’ before ghusl or not. But it is essential to pay attention to rinsing 
    the mouth and nose, because these are essential for both wudoo’ and ghusl.

Wali al-Deen al-‘Iraaqi said:

It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (9/211, 212) under the heading Selling that which is intended to be used for haraam purposes: 
The majority are of the view that everything that is intended for haraam purposes, and every conduct that could lead to sin, is haraam and the sale of anything where it is known that the purchaser intends to use it for something that is not allowed is forbidden. 
Among the examples given by al-Shaafa’i are: the sale of drugs to one whom you think will use them in a haraam manner, or wood to one who will make it into a musical instrument, or a silk garment to a man who will wear it when it is not necessary to do so, or selling a weapon to a wrongdoer or a bandit, or an animal to one who will make it carry more than it is able to. 
Al-Sharwaani and Ibn Qaasim al-‘Abaadi stated that a Muslim should not sell food to a kaafir if he knows or thinks that he will eat it during the day in Ramadan, and al-Ramli stated this in a fatwa and said: Because that is helping him to commit sin, based on the most correct view which is that the minor issues of sharee’ah are addressed to the kuffaar.

49698,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49698,Is Fasting Without Praying Accepted?,Is it permissible to fast without praying?,"The fast of one who does not pray is not valid and is not accepted, because the one who does not pray is a disbeliever and an apostate.","Will good deeds be accepted from those who do not pray?


Does your fast count if you don't pray?","Praise be to Allah.Will good deeds be accepted from those who do not pray?
No good deeds will be accepted from one who does not pray – no zakah, no fasting, no Hajj or anything else. 
Al-Bukhari (520) narrated that Buraydah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does not pray ‘Asr, his good deeds will be annulled.” 
What is meant by “his good deeds will be annulled” is that they will be rendered invalid and will be of no benefit to him. This hadith indicates that Allah will not accept any good deed from one who does not pray, so the one who does not pray will not benefit at all from his good deeds and no good deed of his will be taken up to Allah. 
It seems from the hadith that there are two types of those who do not pray: those who do not pray at all, which annuls all their good deeds, and those who do not offer a particular prayer on a particular day, which annuls the good deeds of that day. So annulment of all good deeds happens to those who forsake all the prayers, and annulment of the good deeds of a particular day happens to the one who omits a particular prayer. 
Does your fast count if you don't pray?
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin was asked in Fatawa al-Siyam (p. 87) about the ruling on the fasting of one who does not pray.
 He replied: 
“The fast of one who does not pray is not valid and is not accepted, because the one who does not pray is a disbeliever and an apostate . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But if they repent [by rejecting Shirk (polytheism) and accept Islamic Monotheism], perform As-Salah (Iqamat-as-Salah) and give Zakah, then they are your brethren in religion.” [al-Tawbah 9:11]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Between a man and shirk and disbelief stands his giving up prayer.” (Narrated by Muslim, 82) And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The covenant that separates us from them is prayer; whoever gives up prayer is a disbeliever.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2621; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi) 
This is also the view of most of the Companions, if not their consensus. ‘Abd-Allah ibn Shaqiq (may Allah have mercy on him), who was one of the well-known Tabi’in, said: The Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not think that omitting any action made a person a disbeliever, except for prayer. Based on this, if a person fasts but he does not pray, then his fast is rejected and not accepted, and it will not avail him anything before Allah on the Day of Resurrection. We say to him: Pray then fast, because if you fast but do not pray, then your fast will be rejected, because acts of worship are not accepted from a disbeliever.”
The Standing Committee (10/140) was asked: if a person is keen to fast in Ramadan and to pray in Ramadan only, but he stops praying as soon as Ramadan is over, does his fasting count? 
They replied: 
“Prayer is one of the pillars of Islam , and it is the most important pillar after the Shahadatayn. It is an individual obligation (fard ‘ayn), and whoever does not do it because he denies that it is obligatory, or he does not do it because he is careless and lazy, is a disbeliever. With regard to those who fast Ramadan and pray in Ramadan only, this is trying to cheat Allah, and unfortunate indeed are those who only acknowledge Allah in Ramadan. Their fasting is not valid if they do not pray at times other than Ramadan, rather this makes them disbelievers in the sense of major kufr (kufr akbar), even if they do not deny that prayer is obligatory, according to the more sound of the two scholarly opinions.”
