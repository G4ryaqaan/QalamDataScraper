43819,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43819,Prohibition on buying goods from their sellers before they reach the market,What is the ruling on meeting business owners in the street before they bring their good into their stores and buying from them?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It is haraam to meet the sellers of goods in the streets 
    before they reach the places that are prepared for the selling and buying of 
    goods, because that comes under the same heading as meeting riders coming 
    in, which is forbidden, because of the hadeeth that was narrated by Imam 
    Ahmad, in which it says: “Do not intercept goods before they reach the 
    market.” It was also narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh (4/373) 
    from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him). And al-Bukhaari 
    narrated in his Saheeh from Naafi’ that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar said: 
    “We used to meet the riders and buy food from them, then the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade us to buy it until it 
    reached the food market. According to another version narrated from Naafi’, 
    ‘Abd-Allaah said: They used to buy food at the top end of the market, and 
    sell it where they bought it. But the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade them to sell it where they had 
    bought it until they had moved it. According to a report narrated by Muslim: 
    The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “Do not intercept incoming merchants; if a person intercepts (an 
    incoming merchant) and buys from him, the merchant has the choice of taking 
    it back when he reaches the market.” It is haraam to intercept them, and 
    whoever intercepts them before they reach the market is a sinner who is 
    disobeying Allaah, may He be exalted, if he knows of the prohibition, 
    because this involves betraying the seller and harming the people in the 
    marketplace. If this is proven and the seller has been cheated, i.e., he 
    sold it at a lower price which is not the usual price in the market, then 
    the seller has the choice of either going ahead with the sale or canceling 
    the sale. And that comes under the heading of giving the choice when a 
    person has been cheated.” End quote.",Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Ifta’ (13/122)
43840,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43840,Signs of the Judgement Day in Order,"In the present distressed situation many people including scholars are found to talk about the Renaissance of Islam and the emergence of Imam Mahdi. Who is or may be Imam Mahdi and is there any evidence about his possible emergence, in the light of Quran and Hadith? 
What will be the order of occurrence of events before the Qiyamah, including the emergence of Imam al-Mahdi, Fitna-ad-Dajjal, Yajuj Majuj and ‘Isa (Jesus)? Kindly reply in detail","Muslim scholars have different views concerning the order of the signs of the Judgement Day because no such order of events is narrated in the Sunnah.

Imam al-Mahdi will be a righteous man from among the descendants of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who will appear at the end of time, through whom Allah will set mankind’s affairs straight, and will fill the earth with fairness and justice just as it was filled with wrongdoing and oppression. 
What is the name of Imam al-Mahdi?
The name of Imam al-Mahdi will be the same as the name of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and his father’s name will be the same as that of the father of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
So his name will be Muhammad ibn ‘Abd-Allah al-Mahdi, or Ahmad ibn ‘Abd-Allah al-Mahdi. He will be descended from Fatimah the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), through al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him). 
Signs of the coming of Imam al-Mahdi
The sign of his appearance will be widespread corruption and the earth being filled with wrongdoing and aggression. 
There are a number of ahadith which point to his appearance and attributes being as described above. When taken together these reports reach the level of tawatur (i.e., narrated from so many people by so many people that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed upon a lie). This is explained in more detail in question no. 1252 .

Order of the Signs of the Judgement Day 
With regard to the order in which the portents of the Hour will appear, there is some difference of opinion among the scholars, the reason being that no such order of events is narrated in the Sunnah. However the scholars have determined the order of some of the events, as follows:
Appearance of the minor signs of the Hour 
1 – The appearance of the minor portents of the Hour, of which there are many which will not appear in any specific order. These include: 

the sending of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his death; 
the plague of ‘Amwas; 
the appearance of tribulations;
the loss of honesty; 
the disappearance of knowledge; 
the spread of riba, 
musical instruments and alcohol; regarding these things as permissible; 
competition in erecting tall buildings; 
a great deal of killing; 
time passing more quickly; 
adornment of the mosques; 
prevalence of shirk; 
the spread of immorality; 
a great deal of stinginess; 
many earthquakes; 
landslides, 
transformations and pelting with stones from the heavens; 
disappearance of righteous people; 
believers’ dreams coming true; 
neglect of the Sunnah; 
a great deal of lying; 
a great deal of false testimony; 
a great deal of sudden death; 
a great deal of rain but little growth of vegetation; 
wishing for death; 
increase in numbers of the “Romans” and fighting them; 
and other signs which are narrated in sahih ahadith from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 

Appearance of al-Mahdi
2 – The appearance of the Mahdi , who will appear before the Dajjal and before the descent of ‘Isa ibn Maryam (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). This is indicated by the hadith of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “ ‘Isa ibn Maryam will come down and their leader the Mahdi will say to him: ‘Come and lead us in prayer.’ But he will say: ‘No, one of them should lead the others in prayer, as a sign of honour from Allah to this ummah.’: Narrated by al-Harith ibn Abi Usamah in his Musnad. 
And Ibn al-Qayyim said in al-Manar al-Munif (1/147): its isnad is jayyid. The hadeeth is narrated with a mawsul isnad in Sahih Muslim, without naming their leader. Muslim’s report says: “… ‘And ‘Isa ibn Maryam (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will come down and their leader will say to him: ‘Come and lead us in prayer.’ But he will say: ‘No, one of them should lead the others in prayer, as a sign of honour from Allah to this ummah.’” Narrated by Muslim, 225. 
So ‘Isa (peace be upon him) will follow the Mahdi in prayer, which indicates that the Mahdi will appear before ‘Isa, and ‘Isa will kill the Dajjal, which indicates that the Dajjal will appear during the time of the Mahdi. 
Appearance of al-Dajjal
3 – The appearance of the Dajjal – for more detail about his emergence, please see Questions no. 171 , 8301 . 
The descent of Jesus
4 – The descent of ‘Isa ibn Maryam and his killing the Dajjal. 
5 – The appearance of Yajuj and Majuj (Gog and Magog). One indication that Yajuj and Majuj will emerge at the time of ‘Isa (peace be upon him) is the hadith of al-Nawwas ibn Sam'an, which says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told them about the Dajjal, and said: “Whilst he is like that, Allah will reveal to ‘Isa: ‘I have released slaves of Mine whom no one will be able to fight. Take My slaves to safety in al-Tur (Sinai),’ and Allah will send Yajuj and Majuj , who will come swarming down from every mound. The first of them will pass by Lake Tiberias and will drink the water in it, and the last of them will pass by it and will say, ‘There was water here once.’” Narrated by Muslim, no. 2937.  
Then the signs will come quickly, one after another. According to a hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The signs will come one after another, like beads falling from a string”. Narrated by al-Tabarani in al-Mu’jam al-Awsat; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’. Then the sun will rise from the west, the Beast will emerge, and there will be landslides and other major signs.  We ask Allah to make us steadfast unto death.
