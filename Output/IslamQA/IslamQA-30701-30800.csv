That is so that the company will take the money it is owed from the insurance company in the event that the employee dies before praying off the loan. Is this loan halaal or haraam? Please advise us, may Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Taking good loans which are prescribed in sharee’ah and which do not involve interest is permissible, but it is not permissible to make that dependent upon conditions which are not Islamically acceptable. That includes the condition mentioned in the question; what renders it unacceptable is the fact that the company stipulates that the person who is borrowing the money is required to take out life insurance. There is no doubt that life insurance – and indeed all kinds of insurance – is haraam, and it is a form of gambling. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:  
Insurance on one’s life and possessions is forbidden according to sharee’ah and is not permitted, because it involves ambiguity and riba (usury, interest) and Allaah has forbidden all kinds of transactions that involve riba and ambiguity out of mercy towards the ummah and in order to protect them from harm. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allaah has permitted trading and forbidden Riba”
[al-Baqarah 2:275]
and it was narrated in a saheeh report that the Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade transactions that involve ambiguity. And Allaah is the source of strength. 
Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/5 
On this basis, it is not permissible to participate in housing loan programs where the company stipulates that the beneficiary must take out life insurance. 
“And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).
And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allaah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allaah has set a measure for all things”
[al-Talaaq 65:2-3 – interpretation of the meaning] 
“and whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make his matter easy for him”
[al-Talaaq 65:4 – interpretation of the meaning]
Whoever gives up something for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will compensate him with something better than it.

30765,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/30765,A Fabricated Hadeeth About Advice Given to ‘Ali,"I have received via e-mail a hadeeth attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and I have seen it in more than one discussion board.  
The one who wrote it says that he received it via e-mail.

This is the text of the hadeeth:

The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:

“O ‘Ali, do not sleep until you have done five things, which are: reading the entire Quran, giving four thousand dirhams in charity, preserving your place in Paradise and placating your opponent.”

‘Ali said: “And how could I do that, O Messenger of Allah?”

The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you not know, O ‘Ali, that if you recite Qul huwa Allahu Ahad (i.e., Surah al-Ikhlas) three times, it is as if you have recited the entire Quran? And that if you recite Surah al-Fatihah four times it is as if you have given four thousand dirhams in charity? And that if you say La ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu la shareeka lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd yuhyi wa yameet wa huwa ‘ala kulli shayin qadeer (There is no god but Allah alone with no partner or associate. His is the Dominion and to Him be praise, He gives life and death and He is able to do all things) ten times, you will preserve your place in Paradise? And if you say Astaghfir-Allah alladhi la ilaha illa huwa al-hayy al-qayyoom wa atoobu ilayh (I seek the forgiveness of Allah beside Whom there is no other god, the Ever-Living, the Eternal, and I repent to Him) ten times, you will have placated your opponent.”  
Then they concluded by saying:

The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) indeed has spoken the truth.

Is this hadeeth (narration) saheeh (authentic)?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    This 
    hadeeth is false and fabricated (mawdoo’). 

    The 
    scholars of the Standing Committee said concerning this hadeeth: 

    This

    Shaykh

    about this and he said: 

    This 
    hadeeth which says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon 
    him) gave this advice to ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) 
    is a lie that was fabricated against the Prophet (peace and blessings of 
    Allah be upon him). It is not correct to attribute it to the Messenger 
    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), because “whoever narrates a 
    hadeeth from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which he 
    thinks is false is himself one of the liars,” and “whoever tells lies about 
    the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) deliberately, let him 
    take his place in Hell.” But if it is mentioned in order to explain that it 
    is fabricated and to warn people against it, this is something which will be 
    rewarded. The point is that this hadeeth is a lie against the Prophet (peace 
    and blessings of Allah be upon him) and against ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (may 
    Allah be pleased with him).

After that, you should repeat the Dhuhr prayer in order to keep them in the proper order.","The ruling on praying missed prayers in order


If a person forgets to pray them in order, does that obligation no longer apply? 


Is it permissible to miss Fajr prayer because of sickness?","Praise be to Allah.This question will be answered by addressing three points:
The ruling on praying missed prayers in order
Imam Abu Hanifah, Imam Malik and Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on them) are of the view that it is obligatory to pray missed prayers in order when making them up . The evidence for that is the fact that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) missed some prayers on the day of Al-Khandaq, he made them up in order. 
Al-Bukhari (641) and Muslim (631) narrated from Jabir ibn `Abd-Allah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed `Asr on the day of Al-Khandaq after the sun had set, then he prayed Maghrib after that. Al-Bukhari (631) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Pray as you have seen me praying.” (Al-Mughni, 2/336) 
If a person forgets to pray them in order, does that obligation no longer apply? 
The answer is, yes, the obligation to pray them in order no longer applies if one forgets, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah will forgive my Ummah for their mistakes and what they forget, and what they are forced to do.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 2043; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, 1662).
This is the view of Imam Abu Hanifah and Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on them). (See Fat-h Al-Qadir, 1/424; Al-Mughni, 2/340; Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 2/139) 
If a person forgets one prayer and does not remember until the time for the next prayer begins, then he remembers it, one of the following three scenarios must apply: 

He remembers the missed prayer before he starts to offer the current prayer. In this case he has to start with the missed prayer , then pray the prayer that is currently due.
He prays the current prayer and completes it, then he remembers that he still has to do the missed prayer that he has not prayed yet. His current prayer is valid and he only has to pray the missed prayer, and he is excused for not praying them in the proper order because he forgot.
He remembers during the current prayer that he did not pray the previous prayer, which he missed. So he should complete the current prayer, which then becomes an optional prayer, then he should pray the prayer he missed, and after that, he should repeat the current prayer, in order to keep the prayers in the proper order. 

This is the view of Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him). See Al-Mughni, 2/336-340). This is also the view of `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). Imam Malik narrated in Al-Muwatta’ (408) from Nafi’ that `Abdullah ibn `Umar used to say, “Whoever forgets a prayer then remembers it only when he is with the imam, then when the imam says the Salam, let him pray the prayer that he had forgotten, then let him pray the other after that.” 
Shaykh Al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah – may Allah have mercy on him) said: “When he remembers the prayer that he missed during the (current) prayer, it is as if he remembered before he started it. But if he does not remember until the current prayer is finished, then the current prayer is valid according to the majority of scholars, such as Abu Hanifah, Al-Shafa`i and Ahmad…” (Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra, 1/112)
His completing the prayer that he is currently praying is recommended, not obligatory. If he stops that prayer, then prays the prayer he missed , then prays the current prayer, that is permissible. Muhanna (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “I said to Ahmad, `I was praying `Isha, then I remembered that I had not prayed Maghrib. So I prayed `Isha’, then I prayed Maghrib and repeated `Isha’.’ Ahmad said, `You did right.’ I said, `Should I not have stopped praying when I remembered?’ He said, `Yes.’ I said, `So how did I get it right?’ He said, `Both are permissible.’” (Al-Mughni, 2/339)
Some of the scholars are of the view that he should complete the (current) prayer that he is praying, and then do the missed prayer, and he does not have to repeat the current prayer. This is the view of Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on them), as stated in Al-Majmu`, 3/70. This was also the view favoured by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him). (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, 12/221). But the first opinion is more on the safe side. 
Is it permissible to miss Fajr prayer because of sickness?
What he did was not correct, because sickness is not an excuse to delay the prayer until the time for prayer is over. Rather what the Muslim must do is to offer the prayer on time. If he is sick, he should pray as best he can, for Allah does not burden a soul beyond what it is able to bear. If he is unable to stand, then he may pray sitting down. If he is unable to sit, then he may pray lying on his side. If he is unable to do Wudu, then he should do Tayammum. If there is some impurity on his body and he is unable to remove it, then he should pray as he is, and so on. It is not permissible for him to delay the prayer until the time for it is over because he is unable to purify himself or remove the impurity. Rather he should pray as best he can and do as much of the obligatory actions of prayer as he is able, and he is relieved of the obligation to do the things that he is unable to do.

30791,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/30791,Prohibition on shaking hands with paternal uncle’s wife even if she is old,"Is it permissible to shake hands with a paternal uncle’s wife if she is old, and if not shaking hands will provoke rancour and resentment, because that is the custom among relatives?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is haraam for a man to shake hands with a non-mahram woman even if she is old. That is because of the general meaning of the evidence which states that it is forbidden.  
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
It is not permissible to shake hands with non-mahram women at all, whether they are young or old, and whether the man who is shaking hands is a young man or an old man, because of the danger of fitnah (temptation) that it poses to both parties. It was narrated in a saheeh hadeeth that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I do not shake hands with women.” And ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “The hand of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) never touched the hand of any woman, and he used to accept their oath of allegiance by words only.” 
It makes no difference whether one shakes hands with a barrier in between or with no barrier, because of the general meaning of the evidence, and so as to block the ways that may lead to fitnah. And Allah is the Source of strength. 
Fatawa Islamiyyah, 3/76 
What some people believe, that the wife of a paternal or maternal uncle is not a stranger (non-mahram) is not correct, and there is no basis for that. Rather the wife of an uncle is a non-mahram. The question of a man shaking hands with a non-mahram woman has already been dealt with on this site; please see question no. 2459 and 21183 
With regard to what the questioner says that not shaking hands will cause resentment and that this is customary among them, he should refrain from shaking hands with her, and should explain to her that he is not refraining from shaking hands because he despises her or thinks little of her, but rather because he is obeying Allah and His Messenger. The Muslim has to obey the command of his Lord, and avoid that which He has forbidden, even if that goes against the people’s customs. But he should explain to the people that he is doing that out of obedience to Allah, and he should be gentle and polite so that he can convince them to follow the sharee’ah and so that they will not think badly of him.

It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A woman may be married for four things: her wealth, her lineage, her beauty or her religious commitment. Choose the one who is religiously committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust [i.e., may you prosper]!” 
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4802; Muslim, 1466) 
There follows some advice for you and your father from Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, that has to do with your situation. 
The Shaykh (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
The question leads us to offer you two points of advice. The first point is addressed to your father, if he insists on not allowing you to marry this woman whom you describe as being of good character and religiously-committed. What he should do is to give you permission to marry her, unless he has a legitimate shar’i reason that he knows and can explain to you so that you will be convinced and your mind will be put at rest. He should weigh up this matter himself: if his father had refused to let him marry a woman whose religious commitment and character he admired, would he not have thought that this was wrong and a suppression of his freedom? If he would not like his father to do this to him, then how can he let himself do the same to his son? The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.” 
It is not permissible for your father to prevent you marrying this woman for no legitimate shar’i reason. If there is a legitimate shar’i reason then he should explain it to you so that you will understand. 
With regard to the advice which we give you, we say that if you can forget about this woman and marry another, thus pleasing your father and avoiding a split (between you and your father), then do that. 
If you cannot do that, because you are emotionally attached to her and you are also afraid that if you propose marriage to another woman that your father may also prevent you from marrying her – because some people may have envy or jealousy in their hearts even towards their children, so they do not let them have what they want – I say that if this is the case and you cannot be patient and forget about this woman to whom you feel emotionally attached, then there is no sin on you if you marry her, even if your father objects. Perhaps after you get married he will become convinced and the feelings in his heart will go away. We ask Allaah to enable you to do that which is in the interests of both.

30798,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/30798,Putting money in riba-based banks,"I am a woman and I have a lot of money that I inherited. I am spending on my house, food, college fees and arranging marriages for my children. My husband is a police officer, but his salary is not enough for us to live comfortably without any financial difficulties. I put all my inheritance in the bank and we are living on the interest. Is the way I am spending it counted as zakah or do I have to pay zakah too? How much is the zakah on the interest or the capital?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.1 – Putting money in riba-based banks and taking the riba (which is called “interest”) is haram and is a major sin. 
The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 
Firstly: 
The profits which the bank pays to depositors on the sums of money that they deposit in the bank is regarded as riba (usury, interest) and it is not permissible for him to benefit from these profits. He has to repent to Allah from depositing money in riba-based banks, and withdraw the money he deposited and the interest. He should then keep the capital and spend the interest on charitable causes to help the poor and needy, to provide facilities and so on. 
Secondly: 
He should look for a way that avoids dealing in riba, even if it is investing in a store, and put his money there as a mudaarabah transaction, on the basis that he will have a set share of the profits, such as one-third, or he should put the money there for safekeeping, without getting any interest.""(Fatawa Islamiyyah, 2/404)
What is meant by mudaarabah (silent partnership or limited partnership) is when two people cooperate, one by contributing money and the other by doing the work, and the profits are shared between them according to whatever agreement they reached. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
Undoubtedly dealing with banks that deal with riba is not permissible, because that is helping them in sin and transgression. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression”[al-Maa'idah 5:2]
And it was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba, the one who pays it, the one who records it and the two who witness it, and he said, “They are all the same.” This was narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh. 
With regard to putting money in riba-based banks with a monthly or annual interest payment, this also comes under the heading of riba which is haram, according to scholarly consensus. As for putting it in the bank without interest, in order to be on the safe side it is better not to do that except in case of necessity if the bank deals with riba, because putting money in the bank, even if you do not take interest, is still helping them to do riba-based transactions, so there is the fear that the one who does this will come under the same heading as those who cooperate in sin and transgression, even if that is not what he intended. So we must beware of that which Allah has forbidden and look for the right way to keep our money and dispose of it. May Allah help the Muslims to do that which will lead to their happiness and glory and success. May He make it easy for them to quickly establish Islamic banks that are free from riba-based transactions, for He is able to do that. May Allah send blessings upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.""(Fatawa Ibn Baz, 4/30, 31)
2 – What a mother spends on her children does not count as zakah, because if a father is unable to spend on his children, the duty to do so passes to the mother, if she has the means. Al-Mughni, 11/373 
If the mother is obliged to spend on her children and they become independent of means because of this spending, then it is not permissible to give them zakah. 
3 – The money should be withdrawn from the riba-based bank quickly, and it is not permissible for you to benefit from any of the interest, rather you have to get rid of it by spending it in any charitable way. The interest that you took before is forgiven, if you took it because you were unaware of the Islamic ruling. 
Shaykh ‘Abd-Allah ibn Jibren said: 
You have to repent for the riba that you consumed that was given to you by the bank in the name of interest, but you do not have to dispose of it. Rather it is something that Allah forgives, because He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating Ribaa, shall not be punished for the past; his case is for Allah (to judge)”[al-Baqarah 2:275]
If you take riba after that, then give it to those who deserve charity, whether they are relatives or strangers, so that you may be free of the sin of consuming riba.""(Fatawa Islamiyyah, 2/406, 407)
