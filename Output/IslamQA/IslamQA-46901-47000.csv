He tells us that one of the greatest wisdoms behind marriage is to create tranquillity, love and compassion between the spouses. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy”
[al-Room 30:21]. 
The purpose of marriage that Allaah intended cannot be achieved unless the spouses treat one another kindly, which means that each of them should do his or her duty towards the other. 
The wife should obey her husband on a reasonable basis, and allow him to do what Allaah has permitted of physical enjoyment, and stay in her house and not go out except with his permission. She has the right that her husband should clothe her, spend on her and provide accommodation for her on a reasonable basis, and she is entitled to kind treatment from him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “and live with them honourably” [al-Nisa’ 4:19].  
Our advice to the husband, first of all, is to do his duty towards his wife. If he sees some shortcoming in her in some aspect, then there may be some other aspect in her that calls him to stay with her and not divorce her. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a thing and Allaah brings through it a great deal of good” [al-Nisa’ 4:19]. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No believing man should hate a believing woman. If he dislikes one of her characteristics, he may be pleased with another.” Narrated by Muslim (1469) from Abu Hurayrah. 
We think that the husband has done that, and that despite what he finds in his wife he should put up with her harm, and perhaps this is what the sister is surprised at, that the husband divorce her. Because the husband, by his wisdom and reason, can see that there is the possibility of correcting and changing his wife, and he is aware that the harm that would result from the break-up of the family and loss of his children through divorce is greater than the harm that results from arguments and her showing disrespect to him.  
Our advice to the wife is to fear Allaah with regard to her husband and remember that he is her Paradise and her Hell. She may enter Paradise because of him or she may enter Hell. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Look at how you are with him – the husband – because he is your Paradise and your Hell.” Narrated by Ahmad (18524); classed as hasan by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (220). Allaah has enjoined her to obey him on a reasonable basis, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told women of the great rights that the husband has over the wife, and that if he were to order anyone to prostrate to anyone, he would have ordered the wife to prostrate to the husband, as was narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1159) from Abu Hurayrah and classed as saheeh. 
The wise woman does that which Allaah has enjoined upon her, and she does not transgress the limits set by Allaah. Transgression of the wife against the husband includes reviling him and arguing with him a great deal. If they have children, then it is more sinful, because her reviling him makes the children dare to disobey their father, and he loses respect in their eyes, and this has a negative impact on their upbringing. 
If you know that you can set right the mistakes that you have made, then you must hasten to do that, by seeking forgiveness, repenting, regretting it and resolving not to do such things again. You must also ask your husband for forgiveness and obey him and treat him kindly. Thus you will earn the pleasure of Allaah and the pleasure of your husband, and you will raise your children well. This is the domestic bliss that many people miss out on, which slips through their fingers, but they are careless or too arrogant to set things straight. 
If you think that you are not able to set things straight or have no intention of doing so, then we advice you to separate and ask your husband for khula’, and you have to give him whatever you agree upon of the mahr, or more or less than that, so that he will divorce you. This is better for you than persisting in disobedience and increasing your burden of sin.  
Strive – may Allaah bless you – to set things straight in your home, make your husband happy and bring your children up well. Strive to stay with him, adopt a good attitude and refrain from everything that will make him think badly of you and cause division between you and your husband. We can sense from your words that you feel sorry about things that you have done that are contrary to sharee’ah. This is good but it needs to be strengthened. Strive to say du’aa’s at times when du’aa’s are answered, asking Allaah to purify your heart and actions, and to bless you with a good attitude. Do not hesitate to admit your mistakes to your husband and work out an agreement with him to set things straight between you. Refrain from arguing and reviling, and strive to be a good companion. We advise you to do ‘Umrah together, and to have a program to strengthen your faith and increase the bonds between you, such as fasting, reading Qur’aan and listening to useful tapes. 
We ask Allaah to guide you to that which is best in this world and the Hereafter. 
And Allaah is the Source of strength.",Islam Q&A
46911,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46911,Weeping for Fear of Allah,"I am a man and I never cry. How can I make my eyes weep for fear of Allah in accordance with the hadeeth: “Two eyes that will never be touched by the Fire” in which it mentions “The eye that weeps for fear of Allah”? 

May Allah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Undoubtedly your feelings of regret for 
    missing out on this blessing is a very good sign. You should note that the 
    Muslim can accustom himself to weep for fear of Allah, by doing the 
    following: 

    1 – Making yourself feel fear of Allah. 

    This weeping is the fruit of beneficial 
    knowledge, as al-Qurtubi says in his commentary on the verse (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 

    “And they fall down on their faces 
    weeping” [17:109] 
This 
    is an eloquent description of them and praise for them. It is the duty of 
    everyone who acquires knowledge to reach this level, so that when he hears 
    the Quran he is filled with fear and humility. In Musnad al-Daarimi it is 
    narrated from Abu Muhammad that al-Taymi said: Whoever is given knowledge 
    and does not weep, he deserves not to have any knowledge, because Allah has 
    described those who have knowledge; then he recited this verse. 

    Al-Jaami’ li Ahkaam il-Qur’aan, 
    10/341-342. 

    2 – Reading the Quran and pondering its 
    meanings 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “Say (O Muhammad to them): Believe in it 
    (the Quran) or do not believe (in it). Verily, those who were given 
    knowledge before it, when it is recited to them, fall down on their faces in 
    humble prostration.

    And they say: Glory be to our Lord! Truly, 
    the Promise of our Lord must be fulfilled.

    And they fall down on their faces weeping 
    and it increases their humility” 
    [17:107-109] 

    “Those were they unto whom Allah bestowed 
    His grace from among the Prophets, of the offspring of Adam, and of those 
    whom We carried (in the ship) with Nooh, and of the offspring of Ibrahim and 
    Israel, and from among those whom We guided and chose. When the Verses of 
    the Most Gracious (Allah) were recited unto them, they fell down prostrate 
    and weeping” [19:58]

     It was narrated that Ibn Mas’ood (may 
    Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah 
    be upon him) said to me: “Recite the Quran to me.” I said: “O Messenger of 
    Allah, shall I recite it to you when it was revealed to you?” He said: “I 
    like to hear it from someone else.” So I recited Soorat al-Nisa’ to him, and 
    when I reached this verse – “How (will it be) then, when We bring from each 
    nation a witness and We bring you (O Muhammad) as a witness against these 
    people?” [4:41] – he said: “That is enough for now.” I turned to him and saw 
    his eyes were streaming with tears. Narrated by al-Bukhari andMuslim. 

    3 – Knowing the greatness of the reward 
    for weeping, especially when one is alone. 

    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may 
    Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah said: “A man who 
    weeps for fear of Allah will not enter Hell until the milk goes back into 
    the udder, and dust produced (when fighting) for the sake of Allah and the 
    smoke of Hell will never coexist.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi and al-Nasaa’i.

    “until the milk goes back into the udder” 
    is a metaphor for it being impossible, as in the verse where Allah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): “and they will not enter Paradise until the 
    camel goes through the eye of the needle” [7:40]. Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi. 
And it 
    was narrated that he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of 
    Allah be upon him) said: “There are seven whom Allah will shade with His 
    shade on the day when there will be no shade but His: a just ruler; a young 
    man who grows up worshipping Allah; a man whose heart is attached to the 
    mosque; two people who love one another for the sake of Allah, meeting and 
    parting on that basis; a man who is called (to commit sin) by a woman of 
    high status and great beauty and he says, ‘I fear Allah’; a man who gives in 
    charity so secretly that his left hand does not know what his right hand is 
    doing; and a man who remembers Allah when he is alone and his eyes flow with 
    tears.” Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim. 

    Weeping when alone is singled out because 
    being alone is a time when the heart tends to become harder and there is a 
    stronger motive to commit sin, and it is farthest removed from the 
    possibility of showing off. So if a person strives to do this, and makes 
    himself feel the greatness and might of Allah, and his eyes flow with tears, 
    then he deserves to be beneath the shade of the Throne of the Most Merciful 
    on the Day when there will be no shade but His shade. 

    4 – Thinking about your situation and your 
    boldness in committing sin, and fearing to meet Allah in such a state. 

    One of the righteous people used to weep 
    night and day, and something was said to him about that. He said: “I am 
    afraid that Allah will see me committing sin and will say: ‘Go away from Me 
    for I am angry with you.’” Hence Sufyan used to weep and say: “I am afraid 
    that my faith will be taken away at the moment of death.” 

    Isma’il ibn Zakariya described Habeeb ibn 
    Muhammad, who was a neighbour of his. He said: “Every evening I heard him 
    weeping and every morning I heard him weeping, so I went to his wife and 
    said: ‘What is the matter with him? He weeps in the evening and he weeps in 
    the morning!’ She said to me: ‘By Allah, when evening comes he fears that he 
    will not live till morning and when morning comes he fears that he will not 
    live till evening.’” 

    The salaf (righteous predecessors) used to 
    weep and grieve a great deal. When Yazeed al-Raqaashi was criticized for 
    weeping a great deal and it was said to him, “If the Fire had been created 
    exclusively for you, you would not weep more than this,” he said: “Has the 
    Fire been created for anyone other than me and my companions and brothers 
    among the jinn and mankind?” 

    When ‘Ata’ al-Sulaymi was asked: “What is 
    this grief?” he said: “Woe to you! Death is close at hand, the grave is my 
    house, on the Day of Resurrection I will stand and my path is over a bridge 
    across Hell, and I do not know what will become of me.” 

    Faddalah ibn Sayfi used to weep a great 
    deal. A man entered upon him when he was weeping and said to his wife: “What 
    is the matter with him?” She said: “He says that he wants to undertake a 
    long journey and he does not have proper provision for it.” 

    One night al-Hasan woke up weeping, and he 
    disturbed the other people in the house with his weeping. They asked him 
    what was the matter and he said: “I remembered a sin that I committed and I 
    wept.” 

    It was narrated that Tameem al-Daari (may 
    Allah be pleased with him) recited this verse (interpretation of the 
    meaning): “Or do those who earn evil deeds think that We shall hold them 
    equal with those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah- Islamic Monotheism) 
    and do righteous good deeds” [45:21] and he started repeating it and weeping 
    until morning came. 

    Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) used to weep intensely, and it was 
    said to him: “Why are you weeping?” He said: “I do not know what is ahead of 
    me – Divine pleasure or divine wrath.”  

    Sa’d ibn al-Akhram said: I was walking 
    with Ibn Mas’ood and he passed by the blacksmiths, who had brought a piece 
    of iron out of the fire. He stood and looked at the molten iron and wept. 

    5 – Making yourself feel regret and 
    feeling that you have fallen short in your duties towards Allah.  

    The tears of the repentant at night 
    quenches thirst and cures sickness, as the Shaykh of the Mufassireen (exegetists), 
    Abu Ja’far al-Tabari, said in his commentary on the verse (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 

    “Do you then wonder at this recitation 
    (the Quran)?

    And you laugh at it and weep not”
    [53:59-60] 
Do not 
    weep at the warnings contained therein to those who disobey Allah, when you 
    are people who commit sin, “Wasting your (precious) lifetime in pastime and 
    amusements (singing)” [53:61] – you are heedless of the lessons and 
    reminders contained therein, turning away from its verses. 
Jaami’ 
    al-Bayaan ‘an Ta’weel Aayi al-Qur’aan, 27/82. 
6 – 
    Weeping out of fear of a bad end. 
It was 
    narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When the 
    Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed by al-Hijr 
    (the land of the people of Thamood) he said: “Do not enter the dwellings of 
    those who wronged themselves, lest what befell them befall you, unless you 
    are weeping.” Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be 
    upon him) covered his head and walked quickly until he had left the valley. 
    Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim. 
Al-Nawawi 
    included this hadeeth in a chapter entitled “Weeping and feeling fear when 
    passing by the graves of the wrongdoers and the places where they were 
    killed, and expressing one's need of Allah, and being careful not to be 
    negligent in that.” Riyadh al-Saliheen. 
7 – 
    Listening to moving speeches and lectures that will soften the heart. 
It was 
    narrated that al-‘Irbad ibn Sariyah (may Allah be pleased with him), who was 
    one of those who used to weep, said: “The Messenger of Allah delivered a 
    deeply moving speech at which our eyes began to overflow and our hearts 
    melted.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, Abu Dawood and Ibn Maajah.

One of the scholars suggested another reason for leading prophets in prayer in Al-Isra` which is that this ummah took over the position of leading mankind.,,"Praise be to Allah.The reason why the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was made to go forward to lead the other prophets in prayer in Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa, which is the home of the prophets from Ibrahim Al-Khalil (peace be upon him) is that our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the greatest leader, as was stated by Al-Hafiz Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) at the beginning of his commentary on Surat Al-Isra’.

46921,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46921,Is it permissible for a woman to uncover her face in order to seek knowledge?,"I heard on TV one day that it is permissible for girls or women to uncover their faces in order to seek knowledge. I do not remember which madhhab that was, but the speaker said that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The difference of opinion among the fuqaha’ of my ummah is a mercy.” 

Especially since I am finding it difficult to move from being unveiled to wearing hijab and jilbaab. Please tell me what is right so that I can follow it.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Firstly: 

    The hadeeth “The difference of opinion among the fuqaha’ of 
    my ummah is a mercy” is a fabricated hadeeth, as it says in Asraar 
    al-Marfoo’ah, 506 and Tanzeeh al-Sharee’ah, 2/402. 

    Shaykh al-Albaani said of this hadeeth in al-Silsilah 
    al-Da’eefah wa’l-Mawdoo’ah (hadeeth no. 57): It has no basis, and the 
    muhaddithoon (scholars of hadeeth) tried hard to find an isnaad for it but 
    without success. 

    Al-Manaawi narrated that al-Subki said: It is not known to 
    the muhaddithoon, and I could not find any isnaad for it, whether saheeh, 
    da’eef or mawdoo’. This was confirmed by Zakariya al-Ansaari in his 
    commentary on Tafseer al-Baydaawi. 

    End quote 
It is not permissible for 
    a woman to uncover her face in front of non-mahram men, except in cases of 
    necessity, such as a medical doctor when no female doctor is available, so 
    long as she is not alone with him (khulwah), or when proposing marriage, or 
    when bearing witness in front of a qaadi (judge). In the cases mentioned 
    above, it should be limited only to that which is necessary, and no more 
    than that. 

    A woman’s hijab and niqab do not pose an obstacle to her 
    seeking knowledge. It is not correct to believe that there is a 
    contradiction between covering and seeking knowledge. May Allaah never bless 
    knowledge that is only acquired by means of sin and women neglecting 
    modesty. Women who wear hijab and are covered have reached the highest 
    levels of knowledge and have earned degrees and certificates without mixing 
    with men or uncovering their faces, whilst we see many of those who fail to 
    acquire knowledge wearing the minimum of clothing on their bodies. Since 
    when does neglecting modesty bring knowledge and hijab prevent it? 

    Covering the face is obligatory for Muslim women who have 
    reached the age of adolescence. In the answer to question no.
    12525 you will find an explanation 
    that the face is ‘awrah. 

    We have discussed the evidence that it is obligatory to cover 
    the face in the answer to question no. 
    21134, 21536 and
    11774. 

    The view that it is permissible for women to uncover their 
    faces in order to seek knowledge is not correct. 

    We ask Allaah to help you to do that which pleases Him, and 
    to reward you greatly for your question and your efforts to learn. Our 
    advice to you is to keep away from dubious places where mixing takes place. 
    We give you the glad tidings from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) who said: “Whoever gives up a thing for the sake of 
    Allaah, Allaah will compensate him with something better than it.” So seek 
    the help of Allaah and be patient. The first Muslim women gave up their 
    (former) religion, their husbands and their homelands in order to enter 
    Islam, and this move from being uncovered to wearing hijab is insignificant 
    in comparison to what those women did. Be sure that you will find 
    encouragement from your veiled sisters who will make that transition easier 
    for you. Do not pay any attention to the obstacles put in your way by evil 
    and corrupt people, women and men alike, for they do not wish you well and 
    they do not want you to be happy or be rewarded, nor do they know the true 
    path to happiness and reward.

46955,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46955,She inherited some gold bracelets from her mother and she did not pay zakaah on them,"I inherited some bracelets from my mother, and I do not think that my mother paid zakaah on them all her life. Now I have started to seek knowledge, and I need money to buy books etc. Please note that my husband spends on us and provides food, drink and clothing, but he regards these matters as secondary and does not give me the money that I need for that. 

Is it permissible for me to sell these bracelets and spend the money on seeking knowledge, whilst making a promise that if Allaah blesses me with wealth I will give some money to pay off the zakaah on these bracelets?  Or do I have to sell them and pay the zakaah on them? Can I spend some of it on things other than seeking knowledge, or can I only use the money for seeking knowledge?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
    Zakaah is not due on gold unless it reaches the nisaab (minimum threshold), 
    which is 85 grams. 
If these 
    bracelets reach the nisaab, or your mother had other gold that when added to 
    the bracelets reached the nisaab, then zakaah is due on them. If it does not 
    reach the nisaab then no zakaah is due.  
Secondly: 
    The scholars differed as to whether zakaah is due on gold that is prepared 
    for use (jewellery). In the answer to question no.
    19901 we have stated that the 
    more correct view is that zakaah is due on it. 
If your 
    mother did not pay zakaah on these bracelets all her life, because she asked 
    someone who told her that it was not obligatory to pay zakaah on them, or 
    because she did not know that it was obligatory to pay zakaah on them, then 
    you do not have to pay zakaah for past years. But if she knew that zakaah 
    was due on them but she did not pay it out of negligence, then you have to 
    pay the zakaah that she did not pay in past years, because it is a duty that 
    is owed to Allaah. 
Shaykh Ibn 
    ‘Uthaymeen was asked about a woman who did not know that it is obligatory to 
    pay zakaah on jewellery until recently. Should she pay zakaah for past 
    years? 
He replied: 
    What I think is that she does not have to pay zakaah for the past, because 
    the custom in this country and what is usually stated by the Shaykhs is the 
    well known view of Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him), and the well 
    known view of Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) is that there is no 
    zakaah on jewellery that is prepared to be worn or lent. Based on this, she 
    does not have to pay zakaah for the past, but she has to pay zakaah for the 
    year in which she came to know that zakaah is to be paid on jewellery, and 
    for future years, because the correct view that is supported by the evidence 
    is that zakaah is due on jewellery, even if it is used. And Allaah is the 
    Source of strength. 
Majmoo’ 
    Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (18/142) 
He was also 
    asked about a woman who has owned some jewellery for four years; should she 
    pay zakaah for the past years or not? 
He replied: 
The correct 
    scholarly view is that it is obligatory to pay zakaah on jewellery if it 
    reaches the nisaab.
    As for her question: does she have to pay zakaah on the past years? 
The answer 
    is that if she believed that it was obligatory to pay it, this is regarded 
    as negligence on her part, so she has to repent to Allaah and pay zakaah for 
    the time that has passed. If she did not believe that it was obligatory to 
    pay zakaah on it, either because she did not know that or because she was 
    uncertain because of the difference of opinion among the scholars concerning 
    that, then she found out that zakaah is obligatory, then she must pay zakaah 
    for the year in which she came to believe that zakaah is due on jewellery. 
    End quote. 
Fataawa 
    Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (18/146) 
Thirdly: In 
    the event that you do not have to pay zakaah on these bracelets, then they 
    are your property and you may dispose of them however you wish. You can sell 
    them and spend the money on seeking knowledge and on other things. In the 
    event that you do have to pay zakaah on them, then you must pay it 
    immediately and it is not permissible for you to delay it. So either pay the 
    zakaah from wealth other than these bracelets if you have other wealth, or 
    sell them and pay the zakaah from the price, and the rest of the money will 
    be yours to spend as you wish. 
Fourthly: 
    You should have hastened to pay the zakaah before the estate was divided, 
    because zakaah is regarded as a debt, and the scholars are unanimously 
    agreed that paying off debts should be done before the estate is divided. 
    See question no 21271. 
As you 
    divided the estate before paying the zakaah, the zakaah is divided among all 
    the heirs and each of you must pay part of it, according to his share of the 
    estate. If one of you voluntarily pays all of it, that will suffice and he 
    will have done good. 
Conclusion: 
If you know 
    that your mother did not pay zakaah on these bracelets because she did not 
    know that it was obligatory to pay zakaah on them, or she followed a scholar 
    who said that jewellery is not subject to zakaah, then you do not have to 
    pay zakaah on them. But if you know that she did not pay zakaah out of 
    negligence although she knew that it is obligatory, then you must pay the

She hurts our family and especially my mother, her sisters. She refuses to get married (she is almost 40), she lives on her own and goes to haram parties and weddings, she dresses unislamically and behaves in an unislamic manner and mixes with non-mahram men. She is suspicious of my mother and does bad things to my mother or us children. She is infected with Hepatitis and she tries to give me her disease on purpose by eating from my food or drinking from my cup or using my lip gloss when I don't know about it. She tells me she doesn't like my mother but pretends to be happy when my mother is around. She tries to make me go to the haram places she goes when I visit her. She cut off ties from the whole family and said that she hates everyone except us children but she treats us bad. She is always working for the needs of other women who backbite and look down on her and she does more for them than her own sisters and then she makes us kids work on things for those women. Me and my mother don't know what to do?? We can't cut off relations but the more we are around her the more my eemaan goes down and the more she hurts us. What should we do?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The command to uphold the ties of kinship is one of the first 
    commands that were revealed in Islam. It is indicated in a number of proven 
    saheeh ahaadeeth, such as the following: 

    (a)

    The story of how ‘Umar ibn ‘Absah became Muslim. He asked the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): With what were you 
    sent? He  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “He has sent 
    me to uphold the ties of kinship, to break the idols and to proclaim the 
    Oneness of Allaah, not associating anything with Him.” Narrated by Muslim 
    (832). 

    (b)

    The story of Abu Sufyaan and Heraclius when he sent for him 
    and said: What does he – meaning the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) – enjoin upon you? He said: He enjoins us to pray, give 
    charity, be chaste and uphold family ties.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (7) and 
    Muslim (1773). 

    In many verses Allaah warns us against severing the ties of 
    kinship, and states that there will be numerous punishments for the one who 
    does so, which includes incurring the curse of Allaah and a bad end. Allaah 
    says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And those who break the Covenant of Allaah, after its 
    ratification, and sever that which Allaah has commanded to be joined (i.e. 
    they sever the bond of kinship and are not good to their relatives), and 
    work mischief in the land, on them is the curse (i.e. they will be far away 
    from Allaah’s Mercy), and for them is the unhappy (evil) home (i.e. Hell)”

    [al-Ra’d 13:25]

    Some relatives may cause the one who upholds ties with them 
    to fall into sin, especially if he is unable to change the evil that they 
    are doing.  They may insist – for example – on listening to music and mixing 
    and indulging in swearing, mocking and backbiting. Such people have an 
    effect on their visitors and the one who seeks to uphold ties with them. The 
    Muslim has to advise his relatives as much as he is able to. They are more 
    entitled to this advice than others, but only if that will benefit them, 
    whether he is certain of that or thinks it most likely. But if he sees that 
    they are persisting in sin and especially major sins, and that is affecting 
    his faith and religious commitment, then it is sufficient for him to uphold 
    ties with them in the minimum fashion, so that he will not be severing the 
    ties of kinship. So instead of visiting them, he can just call them on the 
    phone, and if he visits them he does not have to stay for long, and so on.  
     

    But this should after trying his best to advise them and 
    exhort them and bring them back to the right way, as well as turning to 
    Allaah in du’aa’, asking Him to guide them to the straight path.

Other Innovations during Tarawih","Praise be to Allah.Du’a after every two rak’ahs of tarawih
There is no basis in the Sunnah for saying du’a between one salam and the other during Tarawih prayer by saying “Subhanaka Rabbana wa bi hamdika Allahumma ighfir lana (Glory and praise be to You our Lord; O Allah, forgive us)”, and neither the imam or those praying behind him are obliged to do that, because worship is governed by the principle that nothing is permitted except that which was prescribed by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Constantly doing a particular act of worship at a particular time without any evidence for that comes under the heading of bid’ah or innovation. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does an action that is not part of this matter of ours (Islam) will have it rejected.” (Agreed upon)
This great dhikr - “Subhanaka Rabbana wa bi hamdika Allahumma ighfir li (Glory and praise be to You our Lord; O Allah, forgive me)” – is something that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say when bowing and prostrating. 
Al-Bukhari (784) and Muslim (484) narrated that ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say when bowing and prostrating, “Subhanaka Rabbana wa bi hamdika Allahumma ighfir li (Glory and praise be to You our Lord; O Allah, forgive me )” following the command given by the Quran. 
What is meant by following the command given by the Quran is that he would do what was enjoined upon him in the Quran, where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“When there comes the Help of Allah (to you, O Muhammad against your enemies) and the Conquest (of Makkah). And you see that the people enter Allah’s religion (Islam) in crowds. So glorify the Praises of your Lord, and ask His forgiveness. Verily, He is the One Who accepts repentance and Who forgives.” [al-Nasr 110:1-3]
See how the Sunnah has been abandoned in this posture of the prayer, and how the people adhere to innovations! 
Other Innovations during Tarawih
Other innovations which are done during Tarawih include:  

When people say: “Salat al-qiyam, athabakum Allah ((It is) time for qiyam prayer, may Allah reward you)”.
When they say between each two rak’ahs, “Allahumma salli wa sallim ‘ala sayyidina Muhammad (O Allah, send blessings and peace upon our master Muhammad) in a loud voice.
When people recite Surah al-Ikhlas and al-Mu’awwidhatayn between each two rak’ahs, or the imam says “Subhan Allah (Glory be to Allah)” and the congregation behind him responds by saying, “Subhan Allah wa bi hamdihi, subhan Allah il-‘Azim (Glory and praise be to Allah, Glory be to Allah the Almighty).” 

None of these things were narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), hence the Standing Committee issued a fatwa to the effect that they are innovations and bid’ahs. (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 7/207-210)

    The Sunnah is that when the imam recites Du’aa’ al-Qunoot

    du’aa’. But when the imam is praising Allaah, it is better for them to 
    remain silent, because the imam’s praise is sufficient. As for some of the

What do you advise me?,There is no connection between eye twitching and bad luck. Rather this is a kind of superstition which the Muslim must beware of.,"Eye twitching and bad luck: Any connection?


Prohibition of superstition in the Sunnah


Remedy for superstition in Islam


Be optimistic and think well of your Lord","Praise be to Allah.Eye twitching and bad luck: Any connection?
There is no connection between what you have mentioned about your eye twitching and bad luck . Rather this is a kind of superstition which the Muslim must beware of, because it is one of the actions of Jahiliyyah.
Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade superstitious belief in bad omens and he said that this is a form of minor shirk that is contrary to the Tawhid in which we must believe. This is because superstition is a trick by means of which the Shaytan seeks to cause fear and whisper into people’s hearts. What is meant by superstition here is regarding something that one sees, hears or knows as a bad omen . 
Prohibition of superstition in the Sunnah
The Prophet’s prohibition of superstition is mentioned in more than one hadith, for example: 
1- The hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no ‘adwa (contagion except by the will of Allah) and no tiyarah (superstitious belief in bird omens).” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5757; Muslim, 102. 
2- Abu Dawعd (3910) and al-Tirmidhi (1614) narrated, in a report that was classed as sahih by al-Tirmidhi, that Ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Tiyarah is shirk, tiyarah is shirk,’ but there is none of us who… but Allah takes it away by means of trust in Him (tawakkul).” The words “there is none of us who…” are the words of Ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him), not of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). What this means is that there is no one among us who does not experience some kind of tiyarah and superstition in his heart, but Allah takes that away from the heart by means of the person putting his trust in Him and delegating his affairs to Him. 
3- Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no ‘adawa and no tiyarah, but I like optimism.” They said: “What is optimism?” He said: A good word.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5756; Muslim, 2220.  
These ahadith clearly indicate that superstition is haram and warn against it, because it involves the heart being attached to something other than Allah. Everyone who believes that some things may have an effect of bringing benefits or causing harm when Allah has not caused them to be so, has committed the sin of minor shirk, and has opened the door to the Shaytan to make him afraid and cause him mental, physical or financial harm.
Hence the Lawgiver forbids superstition and declares it to be false, and tells us that it has no effect of either bringing benefits or warding off harm. 
Once you have understood this, then if any such thoughts occur to you, you must fear Allah and put your trust in Him and seek His help. You should not pay any attention to these bad thoughts and false notions. 
Remedy for superstition in Islam
The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has told us the remedy for superstition, which was narrated by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad (2/220) and classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Sahihah (1065), from the hadith of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “If tiyarah stops a man from doing what he needs to, then he has committed shirk.” They said: “What is the expiation for that?’ He said: “To say: ‘Allahumma la khayra illa khayruka wa la tayra illa tayruka, wa la ilaha ghayruka (O Allah, there is no goodness except Your goodness, and no birds except Your birds, and no god except You).” [Translator’s note: birds are mentioned here because the Arabs of the Jahiliyyah had a superstitious belief in bird omens and would make decisions based on observations of bird movements] 
Be optimistic and think well of your Lord 
The believer should not be pessimistic or superstitious, rather he should always be optimistic and think well of His Lord. If he hears something or sees something he should hope for the best, even if it seems to be otherwise. He should hope for good from his Lord in all circumstances. This is how the believer is, for all his affairs are good, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “How wonderful is the affair of the believer, for his affairs are all good, and that does not apply for anyone except the believer. If something good happens to him he gives thanks, and that is good for him; if something bad happens to him he bears it with patience, and that is good for him.” (Sahih Muslim, 2999) 
Thus the believer is always in a state of contentment and peace of mind, putting his trust in Allah and far removed from worries and distress which the Shaytan, who loves to cause grief to the believers although he cannot do them any harm, tries to whisper into his heart. We ask Allah to keep us and you safe and sound from all bad things.

46992,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46992,Brief overview of the madhhab of Imam Abu Haneefah,"We hope that you could give us a brief overview of Imam Abu Haneefah and his madhhab, because I hear some people criticizing this madhhab because he relies too much on qiyaas (analogy) and ra’y (opinion).",,,"Praise be to Allah.Imam Abu Haneefah is the great faqeeh and scholar of Iraq, Abu Haneefah al-Nu’maan ibn Thaabit al-Taymi al-Kufi. He was born in the year 80 AH, during the lifetime of some of the younger Sahaabah and saw Anas ibn Maalik when he came to them in Kufa. He narrated from ‘Ata’ ibn Abi Rabaah, who was his greatest Shaykh, and from al-Shu’bi and many others. 
He was concerned with seeking reports and he traveled for that purpose. With regard to fiqh and examining and analyzing reports, he was the ultimate and people depended on him in that, as Imam al-Dhahabi said: “It would take two volumes to tell the story of his life, may Allaah be pleased with him and have mercy on him.” 
He was an imam who was eloquent and well spoken. His student Abu Yoosuf described him as follows: “He was the most well-spoken of the people and the most clear in expressing himself. He was pious and very protective with regard to transgression of the sacred limits of Allaah. He was offered worldly gains and a great deal of wealth, but he turned his back on it. He was whipped to force him to accept the position of judge or controller of the bayt al-maal (treasury of the Islamic state) but he refused. 
Many people narrated reports from him, and he died as a martyr of dropsy in 150 AH at the age of seventy. (Siyar A’laam al-Nubala’, 6/390-403; Usool al-Deen ‘inda  al-Imam Abu Haneefah, p. 63). 
The Hanafi madhhab is one of the four well-known madhhabs, and it was the first of the fiqhi madhhabs. It was said that “The people are dependent on Abu Haneefah with regard to fiqh.” The origin of the Hanafi madhhab and all the other madhhabs is that these four imams – I mean Abu Haneefah, Maalik, al-Shaafa’i and Ahmad – made the effort to understand the evidence of the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and they issued fatwas to people based on the evidence that had reached them. Then the followers of these imams took their fatwas and conveyed them and issued other fatwas based on them, and derived principles from them, and they set out guidelines for understanding the texts and reaching conclusions. Thus the fiqhi madhhab was formed, and the Hanafi, Shaafa’i, Maaliki and Hanbali madhhabs, and other madhhabs such as those of al-Awzaa’i and Sufyaan, but these latter madhhabs were not destined to continue. 
As you can see, what these schools of fiqh are based on is following the Qur’aan and Sunnah. 
With regard to the ra’y and qiyaas adopted by Imam Abu Haneefah, what this means is not opinion based on whims and desires, rather it is an opinion based on the evidence, or analogies, or following the general principles of sharee’ah.  The salaf used to describe ijtihaad in difficult issues as ra’y (lit. opinion). Many of them used to say when commenting on a verse of the Book of Allaah, “This is my opinion (my ijtihaad) concerning it,” but that does not refer to opinion based on whims and desires, as stated above. 
Imam Abu Haneefah followed ra’y and qiyaas a great deal in matters other than hudood punishments, expiations and other shar’i issues, and the reason for that is that he had fewer ahaadeeth at his disposal than other imams, because he came before the other imams and was very strict about accepting ahaadeeth, as false reports were so widespread in Iraq at that time and there was a great deal of tribulation. 
It should be noted that not all the opinions and views of the Hanafi madhhab that is named after Imam Abu Haneefah are the words of Abu Haneefah himself, or can be correctly attributed to him. Many of those views go against what Imam Abu Haneefah himself said, but they were regarded as part of his madhhab because they were worked out according to the guidelines of the madhhab which is derived from the other texts of the imam. Similarly the Hanafi madhhab may adopt the view of a student of the imam such as Abu Yoosuf and Muhammad, and it also includes the ijtihaad of students of the imam, which subsequently became part of the madhhab. This does not apply only to the madhhab of Abu Haneefah, rather the same may be said of all the well-known madhhabs. 
If it is said: If the four madhhabs are based on the Qur’aan and Sunnah, why do we find differences of opinion between them on matters of fiqh? 
The answer is: Each imam issued fatwas on the basis of the evidence that reached him. A hadeeth may have reached Imam Maalik on the basis of which he issued fatwas, that did not reach Abu Haneefah, so he issued fatwas stating something different, and vice versa. Similarly a hadeeth may have reached Abu Haneefah with a saheeh isnaad so he issued fatwas on that basis, and the same hadeeth may have reached Imam al-Shaafa’i with a different isnaad that was da’eef (weak), so he did not issue fatwas based on it, or he may have issued a fatwa saying something that went against the hadeeth based on the conclusion he reached. This is why differences arose among the scholars, but ultimately the point of reference is the Qur’aan and Sunnah. 
In fact, Imam Abu Haneefah and other imams followed the texts of the Qur’aan and Sunnah, even if some of their fatwas were not based on that, the reason being that all four imams stated that if a hadeeth was saheeh, then that was their madhhab, that is what they followed, on what they based their fatwas and from what they derived their evidence. 
Imam Abu Haneefah said: “If the hadeeth is saheeh then that is my madhhab.” And he said: “It is not permissible for anyone to follow what we say if they do not know where we got it from.” According to another report he said: “It is haraam for the one who does not know my evidence to issue a fatwa based on my words.” And according to another report he added: “We are human, we may say something today and retract it tomorrow.” And he said: “If I say something that goes against the Book of Allaah or the report of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then ignore what I say.” 
Imam Maalik (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “I am only human, sometimes I make mistakes and sometimes I get things right. Look at my opinion and whatever is in accordance with the Qur’aan and Sunnah, take it, and whatever is not in accordance with the Qur’aan and Sunnah, ignore it.” And he said: “There is no one after the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) whose words cannot be taken or left, apart from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).” (“Everyone’s statement can be taken or rejected except for the companion of this grave”)
Imam al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “There is no one who will not be unaware of some of the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Whatever I say or whatever guidelines I establish, if there is a report from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) which is different to what I said, then what matters is what the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, and that is my opinion.” 
Imam Ahmad said: “Do not follow me blindly and do not follow Maalik or al-Shaafa’i or al-Awzaa’i or al-Thawri blindly. Learn from where they learned.” And he said: “The opinion of al-Awzaa’i and the opinion of Maalik and the opinion of Abu Haneefah are all mere conjecture and it is all the same to me. Rather evidence is to be found in the reports – i.e., in the shar’i evidence.” 
This is a brief look at Imam Abu Haneefah (may Allaah have mercy on him) and his madhhab. In conclusion, the Muslim cannot but acknowledge the status and position of these imams, but that should not lead us to give precedence to their views over the Book of Allaah and the saheeh reports from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because in principle we should follow the Qur’aan and Sunnah and not the opinions of men; any man’s opinion may be taken or left, except the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him),as Imam Maalik (may Allaah have mercy on him) said.

But that is that best time to make du'a as one is nearest to his Creator. My question is what about the du'a's that we have that are from the Quraan. Are we allowed to make du'a with them in prostration? Or is that considered reciting?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade reciting Quran when bowing and prostrating. 
Muslim (479) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have been forbidden to recite the Quran when bowing or prostrating. As for bowing, glorify your Lord therein, and as for prostrating, strive in du`a, for it is deserving of a response (from your Lord).” 
Muslim (480) narrated that ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade me to recite Quran when bowing and prostrating.   
The scholars are agreed that it is makrooh to recite Quran when bowing or prostrating. 
See al-Majmoo’, 3/411; al-Mughni, 2/181 
The wisdom behind that is: 
It was said that the best pillar of prayer is standing and the best of dhikr is reciting Quran, so the best has been put with the best, and it is not allowed to put it with anything else, lest anyone think that it is equal to other kinds of dhikr. ‘Awn al-Ma’bood. 
It was said that it is because the Quran is the noblest of speech, because it is the Word of Allah, and the position of bowing and prostration is one of humility and submission on the part of the worshipper, so it is more appropriate not to recite the Word of Allah in these two positions. Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 5/338 
Secondly: 
If a person recites a du`a that is mentioned in the Quran when prostrating, such as the words (interpretation of the meaning): “Our Lord! Give us in this world that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good, and save us from the torment of the Fire” [al-Baqarah 2:201], there is nothing wrong with that, if the intention is to say du`a and not to recite Quran, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Actions are but by intentions, and each person will have but that which he intended.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1; Muslim, 1907. 
Al-Zarkashi said: It is makrooh when it is intended as recitation of Quran, but if it is intended as du`a and praise, then it is like someone who did Qunoot by reciting a verse. End quote. 
Doing Qunoot by reciting a verse from the Quran is permissible and is not makrooh. 
Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj, 2/61 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Adhkaar (p. 59) 
If a person does Qunoot by reciting a verse which includes a du`a, then he has done Qunoot, but it is better to say the du`a as narrated in the Sunnah. End quote. 
This applies if he intends to say du`a when he recites the verse. 
See al-Futoohaat al-Rabbaaniyyah Sharh al-Adhkaar al-Nawawiyyah by Ibn ‘Allaan, 2/308 
The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: We know that it is not permissible to recite Quran when prostrating, but there are some verses which include du`as, such as the words, “Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:8]. What is the ruling on saying such du`as that are mentioned in the Quran, when prostrating? 
They replied: There is nothing wrong with that if it is done as a du`a and not as recitation of Quran. End quote.
