3313,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3313,Difficulties facing a Christian girl who wants to take the decision to enter Islam,"I am a young Christian woman and I have
      been reading about Islam for some months now. I have already read a translation of the
      Koran and several books about Islam along with articles and other material I have found on
      the internet and elsewhere. I do not pretend to know or understand everything, there are
      many things that still confuse me, and I have a hard time accepting some applications and
      interpretations of Islam that I have read about. However, I do believe in God and I do
      believe that Muhammad was his prophet and that the Koran is the revealed word of God. The question is what should I do about it? As I said there are still so
      many things that I do not know or understand and this is a major decision I am trying to
      make and to tell the truth it feels like an enormous responsibility and it is quite
      frightening. What worries me the most is that I don't know how well I could live by
      Islam if I converted. I have already changed some things in my life, I have stopped
      drinking, I avoid pork and I try to wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants (or skirts)
      when I go out. But I also know that there are some things I would not be able to do
      immediately if I converted, for varios reasons, (at least that is the way it looks to me
      at this moment), such as wearing hijab. Also, I am currently studying abroad (in the US, but I am from Europe) but
      I am going home to my family over Christmas. I don't think I would be able to tell my
      family right away if I converted and thus I do not know if I could do things such as pray
      all the five daily prayers, fast or avoid pork while at home over Christmas.Would it be wrong of me converting knowing that I will not be able to
      fulfill all the obligations that follow (at least not immediately), and knowing that there
      are still many issues that I do not understand or have a hard time accepting
      wholeheartedly (due to lack of understanding and knowledge . Please guide me .",,,"Praise be to Allah.What you have achieved in your quest for the truth is great indeed. All
    that remains to be done is the most important step you will ever take in your life, which
    is to pronounce the Shahaadatayn and enter Islam. We truly appreciate the great efforts
    you have made by reading the entire Quraan in translation, and other books and
    articles about Islam, and also by already giving up some haraam things such as drinking
    wine and eating pork. The most important thing that you have achieved is your conviction
    about Islam, the Prophet of Islam and the Book of Islam. From your question we can sum up
    the obstacles that you face in two points:
some social embarrassment

some matters that you do not yet fully understand

With regard to the second point, it is not a condition for becoming
    Muslim that a person should know the entire religion, because it is a vast ocean. You can
    become Muslim and then learn the religion and develop full conviction about all the
    rulings of Islam. At the beginning, it is sufficient to believe in the six pillars of
    faith in general terms (belief in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last
    Day and predestination, both good and bad) and to understand and accept in general terms
    the five pillars of Islam (testifying that there is no god but Allaah and that Muhammad is
    the Messenger of Allaah, prayer, paying zakaah, fasting in Ramadaan, and performing Hajj
    to the sacred House of Allaah, for the one who is able and has the means). Realize that
    knowledge and conviction develop gradually, and that faith increases by doing acts of
    worship and obedience to Allaah, which in turn leads to a deeper understanding and
    acceptance of the rulings of Islam.
With regard to the first point, we are sure that if you enter Islam and
    are sincere towards Allaah and do righteous deeds, then Allaah will give you the strength,
    steadfastness, courage and certainty to face all difficulties and overcome them. The
    experience of other women who have become Muslim before you gives you a good example of
    what you could be able to do in the future as regards following the rules of Islam, such
    as hijaab and other issues, despite being surrounded by an overwhelming atmosphere of
    kufr. We also say that if any woman were to ask us whether she should become Muslim
    despite not wearing full hijab or stay a kaafir, we would definitely tell her to become
    Muslim, because the seriousness and danger of remaining a kaafir is far worse than being a
    Muslim but committing a sin.
We understand totally the difficulties and social embarrassment that
    you speak of, and we know that going against ones family and the society in which
    one lives are very difficult matters, but Allaah makes every difficult thing easy.
Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): 
 And Allaah is the Wali (Protector and Helper) of the
    believers. [Aal Imraan 3:68]
And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He
    will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). [al-Talaaq 65:2]
 Allaah will grant after hardship, ease. [al-Talaaq
    65:7]
As for those who strive hard in Us (Our Cause), We will surely
    guide them to Our Paths (i.e., Allaahs Religion  Islamic
    Monotheism) [al-Ankaboot 29:69]
We also want to tell you that it is possible for a person, if he
    becomes Muslim and fears unbearable persecution or hardship, to conceal his Islam and keep
    it a secret, hiding his acts of worship from the people around him although it is
    difficult to do so. But for the sake of following the truth and saving oneself from the
    punishment of Hellfire, everything becomes easy and the believer can overcome all
    difficulties.
Finally, we can only thank you for the efforts you have made and for
    sending this question. We hope that the next step, which you should take immediately, is
    abundantly clear to you from our answer. We will be very happy to help you with anything
    you may need in the future, and we ask Allaah to guide you to the path of truth, to help
    you and to make things easy for you. Allaah is the Guide to the Straight Path.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Now, can she practice her religious rites in the same house and have pictures of the crucifiction of Jesus (A) and celebrate Thanksgiving, Christmas and etc. Can her kids join her? If no, would not it hurt her feelings? Please, answer me on this issue.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a Muslim to allow his wife from among the People of the Book to celebrate her festivals in his home, for the man is in charge of that woman and she does not have the right to openly celebrate her festivals in his home, because of the resulting effects of corruption, forbidden things and display of the symbols of kufr in his home. He should keep his children from taking part in those innovated festivals, because the children belong to the father and he should keep them away from these forbidden celebrations. At the same time he should direct them towards what will benefit them, even if that affects his relationship with his wife. The aims of sharee’ah and protecting one’s religion – which is one of the most important aims of sharee’ah – take priority over everything else.
Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal was asked about a man who had a Christian wife – could he let her go out to join in the Christian festivals or to go to the church? He said, no.
In al-Mughni (1/21), Ibn Qudaamah says: “(Treatment of women): If his wife is a dhimmiyyah [a Jew or Christian living under Islamic rule], he can prevent her from going to the church, because that is not an act of obedience to Allah.”
If these scholars said that the husband should stop a Christian wife from going to church, then what do you think is the case with regard to her celebrating these innovated festivals in the house of her Muslim husband? Especially when we know the harm that results from these festivals, which is far worse than her merely going to the church.

    theory (evolution), and other things that are contrary to the facts stated by Islam and
    the facts of natural science, then the Muslim should avoid them, and keep himself busy
    with something that will be of use to him, such as learning good things or doing righteous
    deeds or reading true stories and historical accounts and so on. Many of the movies and
    novels that are known as “Science Fiction” include a lot of kufr, such as
    putting life and death in the hands of some created being, giving creatures the ability to
    create from nothing, saying that scientists in laboratories can create from nothing,
    making inanimate things come alive, creating life from a fossil that has been dead for
    many millenia, or travelling to the future then coming back to the present. All of this is
    impossible, and no one knows the unseen except for Allaah. Some of these novels and movies
    also include clear contradictions of historical facts that are mentioned in the
    Qur’aan and Sunnah, such as man’s creation and his life on earth. When the
    Muslim indulges in reading these books or watching these movies, it shakes his belief or
    at the very least wastes his time and keeps him busy with something that is of no benefit
    to him. Some people claim that this is just entertainment and a way of passing time, but
    entertainment is not permitted if it is haraam, and the Muslim’s time is too precious
    to be wasted on such trivial things. The Prophet

If what is referred to is accepting an invitation to a meal, for example, and there is nothing involved that is forbidden in Islam, such as mixing of men and women, or foods forbidden by Allah such as wine and pork, or dancing and music and so on, and this participation does not imply that one loves these kuffaar, then there is nothing wrong with accepting their invitation.

3328,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3328,Ways to strengthen one’s memory and combat forgetfulness,I tend to forget things that interfere with my daily activities. Can you advice me any practice according to Quran and Sunnah that might help me?,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is human nature to be forgetful, as the Arab poet said:
He is only called man (insaan) because of his forgetfulness (nasiyaan), and it is only called the heart (al-qalb) because it changes so rapidly (yataqallib).
In the past they said that the first one to forget (awwal naasin) was the first man (awwal al-naas), meaning Adam, peace be upon him. Forgetfulness is something that varies from person to person according to each individuals nature; some may be more forgetful than others. Some of the things that may help to combat forgetfulness are the following:

Keeping away from sin, because the bad effects of sin result in a bad memory and the inability to retain knowledge. The darkness of sin cannot co-exist with the light of knowledge. The following words were attributed to al-Shaafa'i, may Allaah have mercy on him:

I complained to [my shaykh] Wakee about my bad memory, and he taught me that I should keep away from sin.
He said that knowledge of Allaah is light, and the light of Allaah is not given to the sinner.
Al-Khateeb reported in al-Jaami (2/387) that Yahya ibn Yahya said: A man asked Maalik ibn Anas, O Abu Abd-Allaah! Is there anything that will improve my memory? He said, If anything will improve it, it is giving up sin.
When a person commits a sin, it overwhelms him and this leads to anxiety and sorrow which keeps him busy thinking about what he has done. This dulls his senses and distracts him from many beneficial things, including seeking knowledge.
Frequently remembering Allaah, may He be glorified, by reciting dhikr, tasbeeh (saying Subhan Allaah), tahmeed (Al-hamdu Lillaah), tahleel (Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah) and takbeer (Allaahu akbar), etc. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And remember your Lord when you forget [al-Kahf 18:24] Not eating too much, because eating too much makes one sleep too much and become lazy, and it dulls the senses, besides exposing one to the risk of physical diseases. Most of the diseases which we see result from food and drink. Some of the scholars have mentioned certain foods which increase the memory, such as drinking honey and eating raisins and chewing certain kinds of gum resin.
Imaam al-Zuhri said: You should eat honey because it is good for the memory.
He also said: Whoever wants to memorize hadeeth should eat raisins. (From al-Jaami by al-Khateeb, 2/394).
Ibraaheem ibn [sth. omitted] said, You should chew resin gum, because it gives energy to the heart and gets rid of forgetfulness. (From al-Jaami by al-Khateeb, 2/397).
As they mentioned, too much acidic food is one of the causes of laziness and weak memory.
Another thing that can help the memory and reduce forgetfulness is cupping (hijaamah) of the head, as is well known from experience. (For more information see Al-Tibb al-Nabawi by Ibn al-Qayyim). And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

•	Al-Qaza’ style which is where part of the head is shaved and part is left. 
•	Styles that imitate the unbelievers or immoral people. 
•	Styles that imitate foolish people.",Halal haircuts in Islam,"Praise be to Allah.Hairstyle of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)
The hairstyle of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is mentioned in a number of hadiths, such as the following: 

His hair was neither curly nor straight. 

Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said, describing the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), he was of average height, neither very tall nor very short . He had a ruddy complexion, neither very white nor very dark, and his hair was neither curly nor straight. The revelation came to him when he was forty years old.  (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3354; Muslim, 2338) 

His hair came down to his earlobes. 

Al-Bara ibn ‘Azib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was of average height and broad shouldered. He had hair that came down to his earlobes. I saw him wearing a red garment and I never saw anyone more handsome than him. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3358; Muslim, 2337) 

His hair sometimes came down to his shoulders. 

Qatadah said: I asked Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) about the hair of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He said, “The hair of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was neither curly nor straight, and came down to a point between his ears and his shoulders.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5565; Muslim, 2337)
According to another report, his hair used to touch his shoulders. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5563; Muslim, 2338)
Sometimes his hair was shorter than that. All of this may be understood as referring to different situations, and each of the Companions narrated what he had seen. 

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to dye his hair sometimes. 

‘Uthman ibn ‘Abd-Allah ibn Muhib said: I entered upon Umm Salamah and she brought out to us one of the hairs of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which was dyed. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5558) 
Ahmad (25328) added: “… dyed with henna and katam.” 
Katam is a plant that is used to dye hair. When mixed with henna, it gives the hair a colour between black and red. (See ‘Awn al-Ma’bud, commentary on hadith no. 4205)

He used to part his hair. 

‘Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to let his hair hang down over his forehead and the pagans used to part their hair, and the People of the Book used to let their hair hang down over their foreheads. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) liked to be like the People of the Book in matters where there was no specific command. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) parted his hair. ((Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3365; Muslim, 2336).
Some of the scholars discussed the meaning of this hadith, and their comments were summed up by Imam al-Nawawi as follows: 
The correct view is that both letting the hair hang down over the forehead and parting it are permissible, but that parting is better. (Sharh Muslim, 15/90) 

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did his Farewell Pilgrimage when his hair was stuck together. 

(This means) making some parts of the hair stick to others using gum or something similar, so that the hair is held together and avoids getting dirty and does not need to be washed. This is easier for the person who is in ihram, especially in the past when the person in ihram was faced with a lot of dirt and little water. 
Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) raising his voice in the Talbiyah, with his hair stuck together. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5570; Muslim, 1184)

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sometimes used to braid his hair, especially when travelling, to keep it from getting dusty. 

Umm Hani said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came from Makkah with four braids.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1781; Abu Dawud, 4191; Ibn Majah, 3631. Classed as sahih by al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar in Fath al-Bari, 10/360” 
Halal haircuts in Islam
With regard to the kinds of hairstyles that are forbidden, they are characterized by the following:                                                                                                  

Al-Qaza’ (lit. tufts), which is where part of the head is shaved and part is left. 

Ibn ‘Umar narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade al-qaza’. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5466; Muslim, 3959) 
One of the narrators of this hadith defines al-qaza’ as shaving part of a child’s head and leaving some of his hair. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“With regard to shaving part of the head and leaving part , this is of varying degrees. 
The worst is shaving the middle of the head and leaving the sides, as the Christian monks do. 
After that comes shaving the sides and leaving the middle, as many of the foolish and worthless people do. 
After that comes shaving the front of the head and leaving the back. 
These three types all come under the heading of qaza’ which was forbidden by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but some of them are worse than others.” (Ahkam Ahl al-Dhimmah, 3/1294) 

Imitating the unbelievers or immoral people. 

There are many such hairstyles, some of which come under the heading of qaza’ – such as the “Marines” haircut, which is forbidden for two reasons, the fact that it is a kind of qaza’ and the fact that it is an imitation of the unbelievers . Some of them do not involve qaza’ but they are styles that belong to the unbelievers, such as making some of the hair stand up and letting the rest hang down, and so on. 
This also includes every hairstyle that belongs to the unbelievers or immoral people, because it is not permissible for a Muslim to resemble them in that, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4031. Classed as hasan by al-Hafiz ibn Hajar in Fath al-Bari, 10/271. its isnad was classed as jayyid by Shaykh al-Islam in Iqtida al-Sirat al-Mustaqim, p. 82) 
Shaykh al-Islam said: 
“The least that we can say about this hadith is that it implies that it is haram to imitate them, although the apparent meaning is that the one who imitates them is a kafir, as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if any amongst you takes them (as Awliya), then surely, he is one of them.” [al-Maidah 5:51]” (Iqtida al-Sirat al-Mustaqim, p. 83)

Imitating foolish people. 

These are hairstyles worn by some of the foolish people, which may be included in the categories mentioned above.

Is this true ? I thought Allah forgives all sins! I am really in despair now.",,,"Praise be to Allah.With regard to the idea that Allaah forgives all sins: this is correct, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say: “O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Zumar 39:53].
Minor sins (saghaa’ir) are expiated for by doing acts of worship and by avoiding major sins (kabaa’ir), because of the following evidence (daleel):


Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):


“If you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall expiate from you your (small) sins, and admit you to a Noble Entrance (i.e. Paradise)” [al-Nisaa’ 4:31]
It was reported from Ibn Mas’ood that a man kissed a woman, then he came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and told him about it. Then Allaah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning): “And perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as- Salaah), at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night [i.e. the five compulsory Salaah (prayers)]. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds (i.e. small sins).” [Hood 11:114]. The man said, O Messenger of Allaah, is this just for me? He said, “It is for all of my Ummah.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 503; Muslim, 2763)
It was reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The five prayers and Jumu’ah are an expiation from one week to the next, so long as you do not commit major sins.” (Narrated by Muslim, 233).
There are many things that expiate for minor sins, such as fasting, qiyaam, wudoo’, etc. But major sins require specific acts of expiation, such as sincere repentance, the carrying out of the Islamic punishment (hadd) on the one who committed them, etc., as can be seen in the following texts:


It was reported from ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, when there was a group of his Sahaabah around him: “Give allegiance to me that you will not associate anything in worship with Allaah, not steal, not commit fornication, not kill your children… and not disobey me in what is right. Whoever among you fulfils this, his reward will be with Allaah. Whoever commits any of these sins will be punished in this world and that will be an expiation for him. Whoever commits any of these sins but Allaah conceals it, then it will be for Allaah to decide: if He wills, He will forgive him, and if He wills, He will punish him.” So we gave allegiance to him on that basis.


The phrase “he will be punished in this world” means, the Islamically-prescribed punishment (hadd) will be carried out on him.
It was reported from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleasd with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Among the Children of Israel there was a man who killed ninety-nine people. Then he went out and came to a monk and asked him, ‘Can I repent?’ He said, ‘No,’ so he killed him. Then he started asking, and a man said to him, ‘Go to such and such a town.’ But death caught up with him, so he inclined his chest towards (that town, as he was dying). The angels of mercy and the angels of punishment disputed concerning him. Allaah inspired (the good town) to come closer to him, and (the evil town) to move away from him, then He said, Measure the distance between them. They found that he was closer to (the good town) by a hand-span, so he was forgiven.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3283; Muslim, 2766).
But if a sinner dies in a state of sin, if his sins include shirk, then Allaah will not forgive him in the Hereafter. If his sins are less than that, then the person is subject to the will of Allaah – if He wills, He will punish him and if He wills, He will forgive him.


Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills” [al-Nisaa’ 4:48, 116].


It was reported that Ibn ‘Umar said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “The believer will be brought close to his Lord until He conceals him and makes him confess his sin. Allaah will say, ‘Do you remember such and such a sin?’ The man will say, ‘Yes, I admit it.’ The Lord will say, ‘I concealed it for you in the world and I forgive you for it today.’ Then He will close up his record of good deeds. As for the others or the Kuffaar, it will be called out before the witnesses, ‘These are the ones who disbelieved in their Lord. The curse of Allaah is upon the wrongdoers.’”


(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4408; Muslim, 2768).


Your despairing of the mercy of Allaah is not permissible, because of the following evidence (daleel):




Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say: “O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Zumar 39:53]. And He says (interpretation of the meaning): “… and My Mercy embraces all things…” [al-A’raaf 7:156]


It was reported from Abu Moosa that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah spreads out His hand at night to accept the repentance of those who committed sins during the day, and He spreads out His hand during the day to accept the repentance of those who committed sins during the night. (He will continue to do this) until the sun rises from the West.”


(Narrated by Muslim, 2759).


Speaking about your sin and flaunting it openly in front of your friends is haraam, and is a major sin. It is one of the ways of spreading immorality among the Muslims, encouraging evil and tempting others to do similar things. It also means that one does not take sin seriously and regards it as insignificant, and that the sinner is damaging his own reputation and exposing his honour to the slander of others. Islam seeks to put people off from doing such things in the strongest possible terms, as in the following hadeeth:


Abu Hurayrah said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “All of my ummah will be forgiven except those who sin openly. It is a part of sinning openly when a man does something at night, then the following morning when Allaah has concealed his sin, he says, ‘O So and so, I did such and such last night,’ when all night his Lord has concealed him and the next morning he uncovers what Allaah had concealed.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5721; Muslim, 2990).
On this basis:
We advise you to repent sincerely, and if you are tested with any kind of sin, do not speak openly of it or brag about it. You should be aware of the greatness of the One against Whom you are sinning, seek forgiveness for your sin, weep for the error of your ways and adhere strictly to the path of Allaah. Beware of despairing of the mercy of Allaah. If you adhere properly to the religion of Allaah, you will have glad tidings of goodness in this world and in the Hereafter. We ask Allaah to help us and you to do that which He loves and is pleased with. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
3374,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3374,The contrast between the deeds of the Sahaabah and the deeds of the people at the end of time,"I read a hadith in sahih al-jamii, where the Prophet said to the Sahaba that there would be Muslims that would come when the Religion is weak, and they would get reward equal to 50 times that of the Sahaba. I am confused, I thought that there was also a hadith where the Prophet said that the best generation is his, then the ones after them, and those after them. He also said that if someone gold that the sahaba gave?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.In order to understand this issue we must note that there are two types of reward, the reward for knowledge and the reward for accompanying the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Some later members of the ummah may do deeds that are greater in reward than similar actions on the part of some of the Sahaabah because they will have no one to support and help them, and because they will be subject to a great deal of temptation, but they will not have the reward of having accompanied the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and met him.
 Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: 
The hadeeth “The righteous among them will have the reward of fifty of you” does not mean that people other than the Sahaabah are superior to the Sahaabah, because simply having more reward does not prove that one is superior. 
Moreover, the difference in reward is with regard to the same type of deed. But the superiority attained by one who saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cannot be matched by anyone. 
This is how we may interpret the ahaadeeth quoted above.""(Fath al-Baari, 7/7 )
Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah – may Allah have mercy on him) said:  
They – meaning the later members of the ummah – may have good deeds equivalent to those of fifty men among the Sahaabah, of the deeds that they did at that time. That is because the Sahaabah had help and support in that, whereas those who come later may not have help and support. But the fact that the reward will be multiplied for them in cases where it is not multiplied for the Sahaabah does not mean that they are better than the Sahaabah or that their virtue is any greater than that of the Sahaabah. What the Sahaabah achieved in terms of faith, jihad and fighting the people of this earth by supporting the Messenger, believing what he said and obeying his teachings before his call spread, his word prevailed, the number of his supporters increased and the proof of his Prophethood became widely known, indeed when the believers were so few in number and the disbelievers and hypocrites were so many, and the believers spent their wealth for the sake of Allah, seeking His pleasure in that situation, is something that no one can achieve the like of any more. As it says in al-Saheehayn, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not curse the Sahaabah, for by the One in Whose hand is my soul, if any one of you spent the equivalent of Mount Uhud in gold, he would not attain the level of any one of them, or even come half way.”(Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 13/65, 66 _
Moreover, there is no virtuous deed that those who come later can do, but those who came before did something similar in a more perfect fashion. 
With regard to the words “They will have the reward of fifty of you because you have supporters who help you to do good and they will not have any supporters who will help them to do good,” this is correct in a case where a deed done by a single person among those who come later are like the deed done by a group of people among those who came before, so he will have the reward of fifty. But you should not imagine that one of those who come later will do deeds like those of some of the major Sahaabah such as Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, for there will never again be a Prophet like Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with whom people may do deeds like those that were done with Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
With regard to the words, “My ummah is like the rain, I do not know whether the first of it is better or the last of it,” although this hadeeth is not very sound, what it means is that among those who come later there will be those who are similar to those who came before, and they will be so close that the one who tries to compare them will not know which is better, even though one of them is in fact better. 
This is glad tidings for those who come later, that among them will be those who are close to those who came before them, as it says in another hadeeth: “The best of my ummah are the first and the last, and between them there will be some crookedness. Would that I could see my brethren.” They said, “Are we not your brethren?” He said, “You are my companions.” This shows that precedence was given to the Sahaabah, because they alone are his companions, which is a higher status than merely being brothers.”(Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 11/370, 371 )
It is worth pointing out that there is no basis for the phrase used in the question, “the best of generations is my generation”, although it is often used in the books of Ahl al-Sunnah. Moreover, there is a mistake with regard to its meaning. If this is what he said, then he would have said after it, “then the one that follows it.” But the wording of the hadeeth is “then those who follow them.” The wording of the saheeh hadeeth is: “The best of mankind/people is my generation” and “The best of my ummah is my generation.”

3396,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3396,He wants to talk to a girl without saying anything improper,"What type of love affair is allowed in Islam?  Can I talk to her privately or write without any sexual insinuation? Or, can I tell her that I like her? And if my parents disagree, Do I still possess the right to marry her?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The kind of love that is permissible 
          is that which arises in a person's heart without there being any intention 
          to do something haraam such as looking or mixing etc. As far as talking 
          or writing to the girl is concerned, if this will lead to haraam actions 
          or there is the fear that it may do so, then it is not permitted.  
         In general terms, we advise you not 
          to do that, because it may start off innocently and in a proper manner, 
          then develop in such a way that it makes a person do something haraam. 
          If your parents do not want you to marry this girl, then try to convince
