    We ask Allaah to increase you in faith and piety and to help 
    you to adhere to that which He has enjoined. 

    You should not hesitate to advise your colleagues and remind 
    them about the prayer, rather that is what Allaah has enjoined. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Let there arise out 
    of you a group of people inviting to all that is good (Islam), enjoining 
    Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and 
    forbidding Al-Munkar (polytheism and disbelief and all that Islam has 
    forbidden). And it is they who are the successful”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:104]

    “O my son! 
    Aqim-is-Salaah (perform As-Salaah), enjoin (on people) Al-Ma‘roof  (Islamic 
    Monotheism and all that is good), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. 
    disbelief in the Oneness of Allaah, polytheism of all kinds and all that is 
    evil and bad), and bear with patience whatever befalls you. Verily, these 
    are some of the important commandments (ordered by Allaah with no 
    exemption)”

    [Luqmaan 31:17]

    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with 
    his hand (by taking action); if he cannot, then with his tongue (by speaking 
    out); if he cannot then with his heart (by hating it and feeling that it is 
    wrong), and that is the weakest of faith.” Narrated by Muslim, 49. 

    Not praying is a great evil, indeed it is kufr that puts one 
    beyond the pale of Islam, according to the more correct of the two scholarly 
    opinions, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “Between a man and kufr and shirk there stands his giving up 
    prayer.” Narrated by Muslim, 82. 

    And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “The covenant that stands between us and them is prayer, whoever gives it up 
    is a kaafir.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2621; al-Nasaa’i, 463; Ibn Maajah, 
    1079. 

    You should not even entertain the notion of not praying, 
    rather you should hate that thought as you would hate to be thrown into the 
    fire, as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “There are three things, whoever attains them has found the sweetness of 
    faith: when Allaah and His Messenger are dearer to him than anything else; 
    when he loves a person and only loves him for the sake of Allaah; and when 
    he would hate to go back to kufr as he would hate to be thrown into the 
    fire.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 49; Muslim, 60. 

    With regard to the excuse that your colleague gives about his 
    clothes becoming impure, the answer is that he can clean the bathrooms 
    without his clothes becoming impure, and he can also set aside pure clothes 
    for praying in.  You should note that one who truly respects the prayer and 
    understands its importance and the seriousness of not praying would not give 
    such an excuse. 

    It is essential to advise this man and others, and explain 
    the ruling concerning one who does not pray, and the obligation to offer 
    prayer on time, and that it is haraam to delay it until after work or before 
    going to bed, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given 
    up As-Salaah (the prayers) [i.e. made their Salaah (prayers) to be lost, 
    either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not 
    offering them in their proper fixed times] and have followed lusts. So they 
    will be thrown in Hell”

    [Maryam 19:59]
Ibn Mas’ood said concerning al-ghayy 
    (translated above as “Hell”): This is a valley in Hell which is very deep 
    and has a foul taste. 

    And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “So woe unto those performers of Salaah (prayers) 
    (hypocrites),

    5. Those who delay their Salaah (prayer from their stated 
    fixed times)”

    [al-Maa’oon 107:4-5]
Delaying prayer until its time is over is a 
    major sin, and not praying at all is major kufr – we seek refuge with Allaah 
    from that. 

    And Allaah knows best.

47017,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47017,Commentary on the hadeeth; “two types of the people of Hell whom I have not seen…”,"I was read an answer to one of your questioned but i failed to understand the hadith which you posted. question 10221 It was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There are two types of the people of Hell that I have not seen yet: men with whips like the tails of cattle, with which they strike the people, and women who are clothed yet naked, walking with an enticing gait, with something on their heads that looks like the humps of camels, leaning to one side. They will never enter Paradise or even smell its fragrance, although its fragrance can be detected from such and such a distance.” (Narrated by Ahmad and by Muslim in al-Saheeh). please do some taafsir on it so that i can get to undertand it?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    This hadeeth speaks of two types of people whom the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had not seen, as they would 
    appear after his time, and their destiny would be Hell because of their 
    sins. The scholars regarded the appearance of these two types as one of the 
    minor signs of the Hour. They are as follows: 

    1 – “Men with whips like the tails of cattle” – what is meant 
    is that those who strike people for no legitimate reason, like the 
    oppressive police or others, whether that is on the orders of the state or 
    otherwise. 

    Al-Nawawi said:  With regard to those who would have whips, 
    they are those who work for the police. Sharh al-Nawawi ‘ala Saheeh 
    Muslim, 17/191. 

    Al-Sakhaawi said: They are now the helpers of the oppressors, 
    and usually it refers to the worst group around the ruler. It may also apply 
    to unjust rulers. Al-Ishaa’ah li Ashraat il-Saa’ah, p. 119. 

    The evidence that their appearance will be one of the signs 
    of the Hour is a report narrated by Imam Ahmad in which it says: At the end 
    of time there will appear men from this ummah with whips like the tails of 
    cattle. They will go out in the morning under the anger of Allaah and will 
    come back in the evening under His wrath.” Al-Musnad, 5/315; classed 
    as saheeh by al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak, 4/483; and by Ibn Hajar in 
    al-Qawl al-Musaddad fi’l-Dhabb ‘an al-Musnad, p. 53-54.

    The second type is “women who are clothed yet naked, walking 
    with an enticing gait, with something on their heads that looks like the 
    humps of camels, leaning to one side.”  Al-Nawawi said concerning the 
    meaning of this passage: al-kaasiyaat al-‘aariyaat (translated here 
    as “clothed yet naked”) means that they will uncover part of their bodies to 
    show their beauty, so they will be clothed yet naked. And it was said that 
    they will wear thin clothes which shows what is beneath them, so they will 
    be clothed yet virtually naked. With regard to the phrase Maa’ilaat 
    mumeelaat (translated here as “walking with an enticing gait”), it was 
    said that it means: deviating from obedience to Allaah and from the 
    commandment to guard their chastity, etc. Mumeelaat means, teaching 
    others to do what they do. And it was said that Maa’ilaat means walking with 
    an enticing gait and mumeelaat means moving their shoulders. And it 
    was said that it means that they try to tempt men by means of showing their 
    adornments. 

    With regard to the phrase Ru’oosahunna ka asnimat il-bukht
    (translated here as “with something on their heads that looks like the 
    humps of camels”), this may mean that they make their heads look bigger with 
    veils and turbans, which are wrapped around the head, so that they look like 
    the humps of camels. This is the well-known interpretation. Al-Maaziri said: 
    it may be that what is meant is that they will not lower their gaze in the 
    presence of men, rather they will look directly at them. 

    Sharh al-Nawawi ‘ala Saheeh Muslim, 
    17/191. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: The phrase “clothed yet naked” 
    has been interpreted to mean that they wear short clothes that do not cover 
    the ‘awrah that must be covered. And it has been interpreted as meaning that 
    they wear light, thin clothes that do not prevent others from seeing the 
    woman’s skin underneath. And it has been interpreted as meaning that they 
    wear tight clothes that conceal the skin from sight but still show off the 
    woman’s charms. 

    Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhamamd ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 
    2/825. 

    This hadeeth contains a stern warning against committing 
    these two sins: 

    1-Oppressing the people and 
    striking them unlawfully

    2-Women making a wanton display 
    of themselves and showing their charms and not adhering to correct Islamic 
    hijab and noble Islamic manners.
This hadeeth is one of 
    the miracles of Prophethood, for these two types of people have appeared, 
    and they exist now, as al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said.

    The issue that you are complaining of has to do with your 
    personality type and is not regarded as a true psychological disease. What 
    is needed to treat this problem is the development of social skills, which 
    can be done, but it requires persistence, patience and ongoing social 
    training. 

    This training program may be summed up as follows: 

    1 – Preparing yourself intellectually, mentally and 
    physically to mix with people, put up with them and try to be in harmony 
    with them as much as possible. 

    2 – Playing any kind of team sport such as soccer – for 
    example – which involves some kind of conscious and unconscious contact and 
    interaction. 

    3 – Joining charitable and voluntary associations, attending 
    Qur’aan study circles and halaqahs (circles of knowledge). 

    4 – Try to visit a trustworthy psychiatrist who can tell you some useful ways of dealing with this problem. 

    5 – Avoid feeling isolated from society. Try to forget all 
    things that exacerbate these feelings in you, for the cause of this 
    introversion may be a situation in which you found yourself or a trial that 
    you have gone through. Seek the help of Allaah in dealing with it and forgetting it.

They really miss my kids a lot.My husband is a doctor too and he can't get a leaf from his job.I want to know that in this condition can I travel without a mehram? It is just for the sake of making my parents happy.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It is not permissible for a woman to travel without a mahram, 
    whether she is travelling to do an act of worship such as Hajj or visiting 
    her parents in order to honour them and be kind to them, or travelling for 
    permissible purposes such as going on vacation etc. The evidence for that is 
    as follows: 

    1 – The general meaning of the words of the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “No woman should travel unless 
    she has a mahram with her, and no man should enter upon her unless her 
    mahram is present.”  A man stood up and said: “O Messenger of Allaah, my 
    wife has gone out for Hajj, and I want to go out with such and such an 
    army.” He said: “Go and do Hajj with your wife.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 
    1862. 

    Muslim (1339) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “It is not 
    permissible for a woman who believes in Allaah and the Last Day to travel 
    one day’s distance without a mahram.” There are many ahaadeeth which forbid 
    a woman to travel without a mahram; they are general in meaning and apply to 
    all kinds of travel. 

    2 – It is well known that travel involves exhaustion and 
    difficulty. Because of her weakness, a woman needs someone to help her and 
    look after her. Things may happen to her that make her panic and act out of 
    character if there is no mahram present. This is well known nowadays when 
    there are so many car accidents and other kinds of transportation accidents. 
    Moreover, travelling alone exposes her to temptation, especially since there 
    is so much corruption. Men who do not fear Allaah may sit neat her, and 
    haraam actions may become attractive to her. Similarly if she is travelling 
    alone in her car, she is exposed to other kinds of danger, if the car breaks 
    down or if evil people conspire against her, and so on. It is perfectly wise 
    that she should be accompanied by a mahram when travelling, because the 
    purpose behind the mahram’s presence is to protect her and look after her, 
    especially if something bad happens. Travel exposes her to such things 
    regardless of how long it takes.  
Al-Nawawi (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: The point is that whatever is known as travelling, 
    women are forbidden to travel without a husband or a mahram. 

    The Standing Committee was asked whether it is permissible 
    for a woman to travel to Hajj without a mahram. They replied as follows: It 
    is not permissible for a woman to travel for Hajj or for any other purpose 
    without a mahram. 

    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 
    11/97

2. can a goat less than one year of age is acceptable for Aqeeka (for new born baby two for boy, 0ne for girl).

these are needed please do reply these questions.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not 
    permissible to sell part of the sacrificial animal or udhiyah, or to sell 
    all of it, except in cases where it is done in accordance with the purpose 
    of the sacrifice, because what a person has given to Allaah cannot be sold 
    at all. 
It says in
    al-Mughni: It is not permissible to sell any part of it – i.e., the 
    sacrificial animal – but if the butcher is poor and he gives him something 
    because he is poor, in addition to the wages that he gives him, that is 
    permissible, because he is entitled to take some of it because of being 
    poor, not as payment for his work. End quote (3/222)
 Shaykh Ibn 
    ‘Uthaymeen said: It is haraam to sell any part of the udhiyah, whether the 
    meat or anything else, even the skin. The butcher should not be given 
    anything from it in partial payment for his work, because that is like 
    selling. (Risaalah Ahkaam al-Hadiy wa’l-Udhiyah) 
And he (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him) said: It is not permissible to dispose of it – 
    i.e., the udhiyah – in ways that would prevent going ahead with the 
    sacrifice, such as selling, giving away, giving as a pledge and so on, 
    unless he replaces it with something that serves the purpose pf sacrifice 
    better, not for his own ends. If he selects a sheep for sacrifice then he 
    decides that he wants to keep it for some reason and replaces it with one 
    that is better so that he can keep it, that is not permissible, because he 
    is taking back something that he had set aside for Allaah for his own ends 
    and not for serving the purpose of sacrifice in a better way. 
With regard 
    to rams, which are male sheep, the ram should have reached the age of one 
    year in order for it to be permissible as a sacrifice, but the Sunnah shows 
    that it is permissible to sacrifice a jadh’ah. The majority of scholars say 
    that this applies only to jadh’ah of sheep, not of goats. A jadh’ah of sheep 
    is one that is six months old, but the older it is than six months the 
    better, because some of the madhhabs say that jadh’ah means one that is a 
    year old. 
The evidence 
    that indicates that the desirable age according to sharee’ah is one year is 
    the marfoo’ hadeeth of Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him): 
“Do not 
    slaughter anything but a two-year-old animal, unless it is too difficult for 
    you, in which case slaughter a jadh’ah sheep.”
Narrated by 
    Muslim 1963.  
The apparent 
    meaning of the hadeeth is that a jadh’ah of sheep is only acceptable if a 
    two-year-old is not available. But the majority of scholars interpreted that 
    as referring to what is mustahabb, and they quoted the following as 
    evidence: 
1 – It was 
    narrated from one of the companions of the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) that “a jadha’h is sufficient for what a two-year-old 
    is sufficient.” Narrated by al-Nasaa’i (4383) and Abu Dawood (2799); classed 
    as saheeh by al-Albaani. 
2 – It was 
    narrated that ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:  We 
    sacrificed a jadh’ah of sheep along with the Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Narrated by al-Nasaa’i (4382). Its 
    isnaad was classed as qawiy by al-Haafiz in al-Fath, and as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani. See the commentary on Zaad al-Ma’aad (2/317). 
It should be 
    noted that the same conditions are stipulated for ‘aqeeqah as for udhiyah: 
    the animal should be free of faults and of the proper age. The evidence for 
    that is qiyaas (analogy), on the basis that both are sacrifices. 
Thus it may be known that it is acceptable for you to sacrifice a sheep that has reached the age of six months. And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A

We have been brought up & supported by our grand-father (mother's father who is no longer living) every since our separation from our father 23 years ago. After my grand-father's death 14 years ago, I am & have been the only financial supporter for my family. I have a father who is separated from us & has not had any contact with us for the last 23 years & is married to another woman. He has not not supported us financially either ever since the separation 23 years ago. I have one house part of which was gifted to me by my mother & part of which I invested my money in. Now is the house in in my name & consititues 80% of my wealth. Rest of my modest wealth is in cash & shares. How should I write my last will according to Islamic law ?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: It is not necessary to write a will with regard to the division of a person’s estate during his lifetime, because one of the conditions of inheritance is that the death of the testator be established. Once his death has been established, his estate is divided as prescribed in sharee’ah among his living heirs. That is because the share of each heir is defined according to sharee’ah, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“There is a share for men and a share for women from what is left by parents and those nearest related, whether, the property be small or large — a legal share”
[al-Nisa’ 4:7]
It is better not to divide the estate too early (i.e., before death) unless the testator fears some kind of corruption or dispute among the heirs, or that the shar’i ruling will not be applied to his estate because he lives in a country that follows man-made laws and not sharee’ah. In that case he can write that in his will. 
Secondly: If we assume that your possessions will be divided only among the people mentioned in the question – two sons, a wife, a mother, a maternal grandmother, a sister and a father (you mentioned that your father is alive and that he left you, and did not do his duty of spending on you etc, but he will inherit from you and you from him) – then the division of the estate would be as follows: 
The wife gets one-eighth, and the father and mother each get one-sixth. The two sons takes the rest of the estate, shared equally between them. It is not permissible for you to bequeath anything to any of these people in addition to his or her legal share, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has given each person who is entitled his rightful share, so there is no bequest to an heir.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2046; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. 
With regard to the sister, she is prevented from inheriting by the presence of the two sons and the father, so she does not inherit. The maternal grandmother is prevented from inheriting by the presence of the mother. 
It is permissible for you to bequeath part of the estate to them (the sister and grandmother), so long as it is no more than one-third of the total. 
Thirdly:
You mentioned in your question that your mother gave you part of the house as a gift but you do not mention whether she gave your sister any part of it. If she did not give her any part of it then she has failed to be just in giving to her children. It is not permissible for a person to give something to some of his children and not others, or to favour some of them over others in gift-giving. Rather it is obligatory to be fair in giving, because of the hadeeth of al-Nu’maan ibn Basheer who said that his father brought him to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he gave him a gift, to ask the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to bear witness to that. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Have you given something similar to all your children?” He said: “No.” He said: “Take it back.” Then he said: “Fear Allah and treat your children equally.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2398. 
Treating children equally means giving a son the equivalent of the share of two daughters, because this is how Allah has divided the inheritance, and there is nothing fairer than the division allocated by Allah. 
Based on this, you should either give your sister one-third of that which your mother gave you, or return the gift to your mother, unless your sister willingly foregoes her rights, in which case there is nothing wrong with it. And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
47040,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47040,Man divorcing his wife on his parents’ orders,"What is the shar’i ruling on a man divorcing his wife when his parents tell him to, on the grounds that this wife used to work for them as a servant in the past? Is this regarded as disobeying one’s parents? Please note that this wife currently lives an honourable life.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Undoubtedly the parents are those who are most deserving of 
    respect, obedience and kind treatment. Allaah mentions the command to treat 
    parents well alongside the command to worship Him as He says (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 

    “And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. 
    And that you be dutiful to your parents”

    [al-Isra’ 17:23]
Obedience to parents is 
    obligatory on the child with regard to that which will benefit them and will 
    not harm the child. With regard to that which does not bring them any 
    benefits or which will cause harm to the child, he does not have to obey 
    them in that case. 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said in al-Ikhtiyaaraat (p. 114): A person is obliged to obey his 
    parents with regard to that which is not sinful, even if they are immoral 
    evildoers… This has to do with that which is beneficial for them and not 
    harmful to him. End quote. 

    Divorce with no acceptable reason is something that is hated 
    by Allaah, because it destroys the blessings of marriage and exposes the 
    family to destruction and the children to loss. It may also involve 
    injustice towards the woman. The fact that the wife had been a servant in 
    the past is not a legitimate reason for divorce, especially if she is 
    religiously-committed and has a good attitude. 

    Based on this, he does not have to obey his parents and 
    divorce his wife, and that is not regarded as being disobedient towards 
    them. But the son should express his refusal to divorce her in a kind and 
    gentle manner, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them 
    but address them in terms of honour

    [al-Isra’ 17:23]
Shaykh Muhammad ibn 
    Saalih ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about the 
    ruling on a man divorcing his wife if his father tells him to do that. He 
    said: 

    If the father tells his son to divorce his wife, one of the 
    following two scenarios must apply: 

    1 – Where the father gives a legitimate reason why he should 
    divorce her and separate from her, such as saying, Divorce your wife because 
    her behaviour is suspicious, such as she flirts with men or goes out to 
    gatherings that are not decent and so on. In this case the son should agree 
    and divorce her, because he is not telling her to divorce her on the basis 
    of a whim, rather that is to protect his son’s honour from being besmirched, 
    so he should divorce her. 

    2 – Where the father tells his son to divorce his wife 
    because the son loves her, but the father feels jealous of his son’s love 
    for her and the mother is more jealous, because many mothers, when they see 
    that their son loves his wife, feel very jealous, as if the son’s wife is a 
    co-wife and rival. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound. In this case the 
    son does not have to divorce his wife if his father or mother tells her to 
    divorce her. Rather he should be tactful with them and keep his wife, and he 
    should try to convince them with kind words until they are persuaded that 
    she should stay with him, especially if the wife is religiously committed 
    and has a good attitude. 

    Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about 
    this very issue. A man came and said: “My father is telling me to divorce my 
    wife.” Imam Ahmad said to him: “Do not divorce her.” He said: “Didn’t the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) tell Ibn ‘Umar to 
    divorce his wife when ‘Umar told him to do that?” He said: “Is your father 
    like ‘Umar?” 

    If the father quotes evidence to his son and says, “O my son, 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told 
    ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar to divorce his wife when his father ‘Umar told him to 
    do that,” the response to that is: “Are you like ‘Umar?” But you should 
    speak kindly and gently, and say that ‘Umar saw something which indicated 
    that it was in his son’s interests to divorce his wife. This is the answer 
    to this question which comes up frequently. 

    Al-Fataawa al-Jaami’ah li’l-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 
    2/671. 
The Standing Committee 
    for Issuing Fatwas was asked about a mother telling her son to divorce his 
    wife for no reason or fault in her religious commitment, rather it was 
    because of the mother’s personal reasons. They replied as follows: 
If the situation is as 
    described, that his wife is righteous and he loves her, and she is dear to 
    him, and she does not behave badly towards his mother, and his mother only 
    dislikes her for personal reasons, then he should keep his wife and stay 
    married to her. He does not have to divorce her in obedience to his mother, 
    because it was proven that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said: “Obedience is only with regard to that which is right and 
    proper.” Based on this, he should honour his mother and uphold ties of 
    kinship with her by visiting her and spending on her, and paying attention 
    to her needs and making her happy and pleasing her in whatever ways he can, 
    apart from divorcing his wife.

47048,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47048,Is the Throne above the seventh heaven?,Is the Throne above the seventh heaven?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.One of the things concerning which there is no doubt is that the Throne is above the seventh heaven; indeed it is the highest of all created things. 
There is clear evidence that points to this: 
It was narrated by al-Bukhaari (2581) that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “In Paradise there are one hundred levels that Allah has prepared for the mujaahideen who strive for the sake of Allah. (The distance) between each two levels is like the distance between the heavens and the earth. When you ask of Allah, ask Him for al-Firdaws for it is in the middle of Paradise and is the highest part of Paradise. Above it is the Throne of the Most Merciful and from it spring forth the rivers of Paradise. 
It is affirmed by all the Muslims that Paradise is above the seventh heaven, so if the Throne is above Paradise, then the Throne must also be above the seventh heaven. 
This idea is further supported by the report narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh (4136) from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abbaas who said: A man from among the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), one of the Ansaar, told me that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “… But when our Lord, may His name be blessed and exalted, decrees something, the bearers of the Throne glorify Him, then the people of the heaven that is closest to them glorify Him, until the tasbeeh reaches this lowest heaven (al-sama’ al-dunya). Then those who are closest to the bearers of the Throne say to the bearers of the Throne: ‘What did your Lord say?’ So they tell them what He said. Then the people of the heavens ask one another until the news reaches this lowest heaven.’” This very clearly indicates that the Throne and its bearers are above all the heavens. 
Ibn Khuzaymah narrated in his Saheeh (9105) and in his Kitaab al-Tawheed (no. 594) that Ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Between the lowest heaven and the one above it is (a distance of) five hundred years, and between each heaven and the next is (a distance of) five hundred years marching.” According to another report: “The thickness of each heaven is a distance of five hundred years marching. Between the seventh heaven and the Footstool (al-Kursiy) is (a distance of) five hundred years. Between the Footstool and the water is (a distance of) five hundred years. The Throne is above the water and Allah is above the Throne, and none of your deeds are concealed from Him.” It was classed as saheeh by al-Dhahabi in al-‘Alw (p. 64) and by Ibn al-Qayyim in Ijtimaa’ al-Juyoosh al-Islamiyyah, p. 100. 
Al-Dhahabi narrated in al-‘Alw (al-Mukhtasar, 35) that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr said: Allah created the water above the seven heavens, and He created the Throne above the water.” Shaykh al-Albani said: Its isnaad is saheeh. 
The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) have stated that the Throne covers all of creation and is above it. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Zaad al-Ma’aad (4/203): 
The Throne is the roof of creation and the greatest of created things. 
The same was stated by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah in Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 6/581, 25/1998. 
It was also stated by Ibn Katheer in al-Badaayah wa’l-Nahaayah, 1/9, 11; and by Ibn Abi’l-‘Izz in Sharh al-‘Aqeedah al-Tahhaawiyyah, 1/311.

47055,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47055,Do the blessing and torment in the grave happen to both the body and the soul or to one of them only?,"if ur to be held accountable for ur deeds on the day of judgement for ur deeds,then y u start getting punishment before that in the grave.wot is the status of the SOUL at that time.if azab e qabar is true,then does a man suffers for his bad deeds inside a grave alongwith his soul.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is no doubt that the torment and blessing of the grave are real, as is indicated by the verses of the Qur’aan, the ahaadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the consensus of the salaf (early generations) of this ummah. Please see question no. 34648 for more details on this issue. 
With regard to the question of whether the blessing and torment in the grave happen to both the body and the soul or to one of them only, the basic principle is that the torment and blessing of the grave happen to the soul, and the soul may connect with the body so that it will experience something of the torment or blessing. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It should be noted that the view of the salaf (early generations) and imams of this ummah is that when a person dies he will be in a state of bliss or torment and that that will happen to both his soul and his body. After the soul departs from the body it will remain in a state of bliss or torment, and it may connect to the body sometimes, so the body will experience the bliss or torment along with it (at those times).  Then on the Day of Resurrection the souls will be restored to their bodies and will be raised up from their graves to meet the Lord of the Worlds. All of this is unanimously agreed upon among the scholars of al-hadith wa’l-Sunnah. 
There are many ahaadith which speak of this matter, such as the hadith narrated by Abu Dawood (4127) and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, from al-Baraa’ ibn ‘Aazib (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: We went out with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to attend the funeral of a man from among the Ansaar. When we reached the grave the lahd (niche) had not yet been made, so the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sat down and we sat around him as if there were birds on our heads. In his hand was a stick with which he scratched the ground. Then he raised his head and said: “Seek refuge with Allah from the torment of the grave,” two or three times. Then he described how the soul is taken and how it is taken up to the heavens then brought back to (the body). Then he said: “And he hears their footsteps when they leave. Then it is said to him: ‘O So and so, who is your Lord? What is your religion? Who is your Prophet?”  
According to another version: “There come to him two angels who make him sit up and say to him: ‘Who is your Lord?’ He says: ‘My Lord is Allah,’ They say: ‘What is your religion?’ He says: ‘My religion is Islam.’ They say: ‘Who is this man who was sent among you?’ He says: ‘He is the Messenger of Allah.’ They say: ‘How do you know?’ He says; ‘I read the Book of Allah and believed in it (or in him).’ That is what Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘Allah will keep firm those who believe, with the word that stands firm in this world (i.e. they will keep on worshipping Allah Alone and none else), and in the Hereafter. And Allah will cause to go astray those who are Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers), and Allah does what He wills’ [Ibraaheem 14:27]
Then a caller calls out from heaven: ‘My slave has spoken the truth. Provide him with furnishings from Paradise and clothe him from Paradise and open to him a door to Paradise.’ Then there comes to him some of its breezes and fragrance, and (his grave) is expanded for him as far as his eyes can see. But the kaafir …” And he mentioned how the kaafir dies, and said: “His soul is returned to his body and two angels come to him and sit him up, then they say to him: ‘Who is your Lord?’ He says: ‘Oh, oh, I don’t know.’ They say to him: ‘What is your religion?’ He says: ‘Oh, oh, I don’t know.’ Then a caller calls out from heaven: ‘My slave is lying. Provide him with furnishings from Hell and clothe him from Hell and open to him a door from Hell.’ Then there comes to him some of its heat and hot winds, and his grave compresses until his ribs interlock. Then there appears to him a blind and dumb man who has an iron mallet which, if he were to strike a mountain with it, it would turn to dust. He strikes him with it, giving a blow that is heard by everything that is between the east and the west, except the two races (of mankind and jinn) and he turns to dust, then his soul is restored to him.” 
This hadith clearly indicates that the soul is returned to the body and that the ribs interlock. This clearly shows that the torment befalls both the soul and the body. 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When the believer’s (soul) is taken, the angels of mercy come to him with white silk and say: ‘Come out to the mercy of Allah.’ So it comes out like the best fragrance of musk and they pass it to one another and smell it until they bring him to the gate of heaven. They say: ‘What is this good smell that has come from the earth?’… Then they bring him to the souls of the believers who rejoice more than the family of an absent loved one rejoices when he returns… As for the kaafir, there come to him angels with a piece of sackcloth and say: ‘Come out to the wrath and anger of Allah,’ and it comes out like the foulest stench of a corpse…”
Narrated by Ibn Hibbaan, 7/284; its narrator said: its isnaad is saheeh. 
This hadith and others like it indicate that the soul and the body will both experience the bliss or torment of the grave, and that the soul will experience bliss along with the body that is in the grave – in sha Allah. 
With regard to the soul experiencing torment or bliss on its own, we have quoted above a report which indicates that. In Sunan al-Nasaa’i (2073) it is narrated from Ka’b ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The soul of the believer is (like a bird) eating from the trees of Paradise, until Allah sends it back to his body on the Day of Resurrection.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i. 
These ahaadith indicate that the bodies that are in the graves will experience bliss or torment – if Allah wills that and as He wills it, and that the soul will experience bliss in Paradise by itself. Both of them are true. The ahaadith also indicate that the souls will continue to experience bliss or torment after they leave their bodies. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Does the torment of the grave happen to the body or to the soul? 
He replied: 
The basic principle is that it happens to the soul, because the rulings after death apply to the soul, and the body becomes a motionless corpse. Hence the body no longer needs nourishment in order to be sustained, as it neither eats nor drinks; rather it is eaten by the worms. So the basic principle is that it happens to the soul. But Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said that the soul may be connected to the body so that it experiences torment or bliss along with it…. Based on that, the scholars said that the soul may be in contact with the body so the torment happens to both of them. Perhaps that may be indicated by the hadith in which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The grave compresses for the kaafir until his ribs interlock.” This indicates that the torment will happen to the body because the ribs are part of the body.

47057,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47057,Division of parents’ estate between sons and daughters.,Parental property is to be divide between 4 brother & one sister . What be the share of each one as shariat.,,,"Praise be to Allah.If one parent has died, or both parents, and they have no heirs except four sons and one daughter, then the estate should be divided on the basis that each male takes the share of two females, i.e. the daughter will have one share and each of the sons will have two shares. So the estate should be divided into nine parts, of which the daughter will have one share and the eight remaining shares will be given to the four sons, each of them taking two shares. This should be done after taking out the expenses of preparing and shrouding the deceased, and paying off any dues he owed to Allaah or debts he owed to other people, and after fulfilling his bequests if he left any such instructions before he died. 
The evidence for that is the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allaah commands you as regards your children’s (inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females; ... (The distribution in all cases is) after the payment of legacies he may have bequeathed or debts”
[al-Nisa’ 4:11]
For example, if we assume that after shrouding the deceased, paying off his debts and fulfilling his bequests, the amount he left is 9000 for example, then the daughter will have 1000 and each of the males will have twice that, namely 2000. 
But if there are other heirs as well as the children, such as the father of the deceased, or his mother or grandfather or grandmother, then each of them must be given their share, and the rest divided among the sons and daughter in the manner mentioned above. 
Note: If one spouse died before the other, then the living spouse inherits from the deceased. In the case asked about here, the share of the husband if his wife dies before him is one-quarter. The wife’s share if her husband dies before her is one-eighth.  
For the children who are left, the estate should be divided giving each male the share of two females, as mentioned above, after the surviving spouse has taken his or her share.",Islam Q&A
47059,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47059,He is asking about a ruqyah so that he will be blessed with a child,One of my brother is married for last 5 years and till today they do not any children. The reason is best know by Allah the Almighty. The couple has done all medical checkups etc and the doctors confirmed that everything is OK with both of them and just wait for the right time which Allah has planned for you and you will a child. But now his parents are not having any patience and telling the couple to do the following act “they are saying that you should fast for twenty one days and recite one of the beautiful attributes of Allah i.e AL-MUSSAWRO (meaning of this name of Allah is Creator of the Face) for seven times blow it on the glass water and break your fast with this water Insallah Allah will give a child”. Now I wan to know is this practice is correct in the light of Quraan & Sunnah or not? If it is correct practice then provide some sort of proof in the light of Quarran & Sunnah,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    This kind of ruqyah that has been suggested to the husband 
    and his parents is not something that has been prescribed in sharee’ah, 
    because there is no proof of it in the Qur’aan or saheeh Sunnah as far as we 
    know. Hence the couple should refrain from doing this and should turn to the 
    kinds of ruqyah that are prescribed in sharee’ah and the du’aa’s that are 
    proven in the Qur’aan and saheeh Sunnah. 

    With regard to calling upon Allaah by His names for healing 
    from sickness, including infertility, this is permissible because of the 
    general meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (all) the Most 
    Beautiful Names belong to Allaah, so call on Him by them”

    [al-A’raaf 7:180]

    And it was proven that the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) did that, as he recited ruqyah for some people by 
    saying, “Adhhib al-ba’s Rabb an-naas, wa’shfi anta al-Shaafi, laa 
    shifaa’a illa shifaa’uka shifaa’ laa yughaadir saqaman (Take away the 
    pain, O Lord of mankind, and grant healing, for You are the Healer, and 
    there is no healing but Your healing that leaves no trace of sickness).” 
    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5743; Muslim, 48, 47, 46. See Fataawa al-Lajnah 
    al-Daa’imah, no. 9120, in Majallat al-Buhooth al-Islamiyyah, 
    issue no. 27, p. 64. 
But specifying a 
    particular name of Allaah such as choosing the name al-Musawwir for praying 
    for healing is something for which evidence is required. If there is no such 
    evidence then using a particular name for du’aa’ is to be regarded as 
    something that is not prescribed in sharee’ah. What is prescribed with 
    regard to du’aa’ is for the person who is making du’aa’ to choose names of 
    Allaah that befit his request, such as saying al-Ghaffaar (the 
    Oft-Forgiving) when praying for forgiveness, and so on. 

    It should be noted that the matter of having children or 
    otherwise is something that is subject to the will and decree of Allaah. 
    Allaah has told us about that in His Book, where He says (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 

    “To Allaah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the 
    earth. He creates what He wills. He bestows female (offspring) upon whom He 
    wills, and bestows male (offspring) upon whom He wills.

    50. Or He bestows both males and females, and He renders 
    barren whom He wills. Verily, He is the All‑Knower and is Able to do all 
    things”

    [al-Shoora 42:49-50]

    This is something that is decreed by Allaah alone. 

    The couple should turn to Allaah and ask Him for righteous 
    offspring; they should turn to du’aa’ and dhikr. Concerning that Allaah says 
    in His Book: 

    “And those who say: ‘Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives 
    and our offspring the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders of the 
    Muttaqoon (the pious)’”

    [al-Furqaan 25:74]

    If there is some sickness that has caused the problem, there 
    is nothing wrong with treating it with permissible medicines, because of the 
    general meaning of the words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him): “Treat disease, for Allaah has not created any disease 
    but He has also created a cure for it, except for one disease, namely old 
    age.” Narrated by Abu Dawood from Usaamah ibn Shareek, no. 3855; classed as 
    saheeh by al-Albaani. 

    And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Allaah has not send down any disease but He has also sent down the cure.” 
    Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 3482; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. 
No matter what the 
    cause of this problem, the Muslim has to depend on Allaah, put his trust in 
    Him and accept His will and decree with patience. He must have certain faith 
    that there is reward and much good in that, by Allaah’s leave. He should 
    think about the situation and lives of other people; some people are tested 
    with bad offspring who cause them misery and hardship, and others have 
    handicapped offspring and cannot bear that, and other such cases such as 
    parents suffering from children’s disobedience, severing of family ties, and 
    so on. Allaah never decrees for the believer anything but that which is good for him, as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “How wonderful is the affair of the believer, for all his affairs are good, and that does not apply to anyone apart from the believer. If something good happens to him he is grateful, and that is good for him, and if something bad happens to him he bears it with patience, and that is good for him.” Narrated by Muslim, no. 2999.",Islam Q&A
47060,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47060,Ruling on wearing a necklace that resembles a cross,"I ask for a muslim friend who has an necklacependant that looks similar to a cross!! Well, it is the pharaonic key of life and it looks like a circle with a lette ""T"" attached to it. So it looks somewhat similar to a cross!! Well, I wanted to ask if it was really forbidden, or since it is not a cross itself she shouldn't worry putting that necklace on !.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
It is haram to wear this necklace, because it is in the form of a Pharaonic key, and it is well known that the Pharaohs were kuffaar, and it is not permissible for the Muslim to wear anything on which there is one of the symbols of the kuffaar or anything that is unique to them. If we add to that the fact that it is in the form of the cross which is worshipped by the Christians, then this is another reason for it definitely being haram. 
It is haram to use things on which there are crosses. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to alter things on which there were crosses. It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would not leave anything in his house on which there was a cross but he would alter it.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5952. 
This is in addition to the fact that wearing this necklace is imitating the kuffaar, which is forbidden in many ahaadeeth and reports, of which the following are the most important: 
1 – The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 3512; classed as saheeh by al-Albani. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This at the very least indicates that it is haram to imitate them, although the apparent meaning is that the one who imitates them is a kaafir. Iqtida’ al-Siraat al-Mustaqeem, 1/237. 
2 – It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw ‘Ali wearing two garments dyed with safflower and he said: “These are garments of the kuffaar, do not wear them.” Narrated by Muslim, 2077. 
Shaykh Ahmad Shaakir said in his commentary on Musnad Ahmad (10.19): “This hadeeth clearly indicates that it is haram to imitate the kuffaar in one's dress, one's way of life and one’s appearance. There has been no scholarly difference of opinion on this point from the earliest generations.” 
Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:  “Imitating them in outward matters leads to imitating them in attitude and actions, hence we are forbidden to imitate the kuffaar, the Persians and the Bedouin, and both men and women are forbidden to imitate the opposite sex, as it says in the marfoo’ hadeeth: ‘Whoever imitates a people is one of them.’” Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 22/154. 
From the above we may conclude that it is not permissible to wear this necklace. 
The Standing Committee was asked to issue a fatwa concerning the type of imitation of the kuffaar that is forbidden. They replied: 
What is meant by the type of imitation of the kuffaar that is forbidden is imitating them with regard to those things that are unique to them, such as customs and beliefs and acts of worship that they have innovated in religion, such as imitating them by shaving off the beard… and the festivals that they have adopted; and exaggerating about the righteous by seeking their help, circumambulating their graves, offering sacrifices to them; ringing bells; wearing crosses around one’s neck or hanging them up in houses or having a cross tattooed on one's hand… ""(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 3/429). 
They were also asked about a Muslim who wears a cross. They replied: 
If he is told of the ruling on wearing a cross and that it is a Christian symbol, and he is told of the evidence that the one who wears it is happy to be regarded as one of them and approves of their ways, and he still persists in that, then he is to be regarded as being a kaafir, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if any amongst you takes them (as Awliyaa’), then surely, he is one of them. Verily, Allah guides not those people who are the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers and unjust)” [Al-Maa’idah 5:51]
It also implies that one agrees with the Christians and their claim that ‘Eesa (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was killed, but Allah denies that as He says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it appeared so to them” [Al-Nisa’ 4:157]
Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 2/119 
Secondly: 
The questioner indicates in his question that there is a relationship between him and that girl, and it seems that this relationship is not one of marriage. This is a haram relationship that is not approved of in Islam, because it is not permissible for a man to have a relationship with a non-mahram woman, and it is not permissible for a woman to have a relationship with a non-mahram man, because that involves doing things that Allah has forbidden, such as speaking softly, looking, touching, being alone with a person of the opposite sex or immoral actions, and because it corrupts the heart and spoils one's relationship with Allah and submission to Him, even if they do not have a haram physical relationship.

“but Al-Birr (righteousness) is (the quality of) the one who believes in Allaah, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book, the Prophets and gives his wealth, in spite of love for it, to the kinsfolk, to the orphans, …”
[al-Baqarah 2:177]
It was narrated from Sahl ibn Sa’d that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I and the one who sponsors an orphan will be like this in Paradise,” and he gestured with his index and middle fingers. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 5659. 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The one who sponsors an orphan, whether he is related to him or not, he and I will be like these two in Paradise,” and Maalik gestured with his index and middle fingers. Narrated by Muslim, 2983. 
Sponsoring an orphan is not limited to non-relatives. It is recommended with regard to relatives and non-relatives like. Indeed the reward for sponsoring an orphan who is a relative includes sponsoring an orphan and the reward for upholding the ties of kinship. 
This indicated by the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) quoted above. 
Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath: What is meant by “related to him” is when a grandfather, paternal uncle, brother or other relative sponsors the orphan or if the child’s father has died and his mother takes his place. (10/436). 
Al-Nawawi said: With regard to the phrase “whether he is related to him or not”, “related to him” means if he is a relative, such as his grandfather, mother, grandmother, brother, sister, paternal uncle, maternal uncle, paternal aunt, maternal aunt, or other relatives. “Or not (related to him)” means if he is a stranger (a non-relative). Sharh Muslim, 18/113. 
If this is understood, then it is permissible for you to send money to sponsor the orphan, even though you are in another country, and it is permissible for you to send it in two or more installments. When you send this money, you should make sure that you send enough so that he will not be in need. 
If you send the money to the orphan’s country, then the one who is looking after the orphan has to spend it on him in a reasonable manner, without being either extravagant or miserly. 
It should also be noted that one of the most important matters with regard to sponsoring an orphan is striving to give him a sound Islamic upbringing, so try to teach him in a manner that is suited to his age, which will have an effect on him, such as giving him books and tapes, and paying attention during your annual leave to things that will have a good effect on him by Allaah’s leave, by showing him compassion and kindness. We ask Allaah to reward you and to create more people like you in the ummah.

47067,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47067,Using the company’s property for personal things,"We work for a public company and we use the company’s machines and equipment to copy some Islamic articles so that others can benefit from them. We also listen to the lectures of shaykhs and daa’iyahs and recordings of Qur’aan on the computer. Please note that this does not conflict with work time and we only do this during our spare time, after finishing work. Is it permissible for us to do that? With regard to what is mentioned above, will repentance from that be sufficient?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to use copiers and other machines in ways that involve using up things that belong to the company, even if that is done for the purpose of distributing Islamic articles, because the employee is in a position of trust with regard to what he has been given and what he has been made responsible for. So it is not permissible to dispose of or use things that have been entrusted to him for purposes other than work.  
If it is a private company and is owned by a specific individual, and the owner allows such uses (of machines etc), then there is nothing wrong with that, because it is like a donation from the owner. But if it is a government company then that is not permitted, even if your boss at work gives permission, because he does not own those things himself, so how can he give them to someone else? 
The same applies to using the computer to listen to lectures and Qur’aan, especially if that involves using the internet etc, which incurs costs for the company. 
Even if it does not incur costs for the company, it is still a dubious area, because it still involves wear and tear on the computer for purposes other than work. 
The point is that it is not permissible to do such things, and you have to repent to Allaah and pay back whatever you have used up. 
If you used papers for photocopying, then you have to give back similar papers. You also have to pay for using the photocopier. If you cannot work out how much expense is involved, do your best to pay off what you owe. You can give paper instead, or something else that will benefit the workplace. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on using government cars for personal purposes? He replied: Using government cars and other equipment that belongs to the state, such as photocopiers, printers, etc for personal purposes is not permissible, because these things are for the public interest and if a person uses them for his own personal needs, this is a kind of aggression against all the people. If something belongs to the Muslims as a whole, it is not permissible for one person to use it for himself. The evidence for that is the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade ghulool, i.e., a person taking something from the war-booty for himself, because this (the war-booty) is public property. If a person sees someone using government equipment or cars for his own purposes he should advise him and explain to him that this is haraam. If Allaah guides him, then this is the desired outcome; if not, then he should report him, because that is a kind of cooperating in piety and righteousness. And it was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Support your brother whether he is a oppressor or oppressed.” They said: O Messenger of Allaah, (we know how to help) if he is oppressed, but how (can we help him) if he is an oppressor? He said: “Prevent him from doing wrong, that is how you help him.”  
And he was asked: If his boss agrees to that, is there any sin on him? 
He (may Allaah have mercy on him) replied: Even if the boss agrees with that, the boss does not own that thing, so how can he give permission to someone else to use it?

The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married the following women : 
1- Khadijah bint Khuwaylid
Khadijah bint Khuwaylid (may Allah be pleased with her) was the first of the Prophet’s wives. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married her when he was twenty-five years old, and he did not take another wife until after she died. All his children were born to her, except Ibrahim. 
Al-Bukhari entitled a chapter in his Sahih: “The marriage of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her), and her virtues,” in which he narrated a hadith from ‘Aishah who said: “I never felt jealous of any of the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as I did of Khadijah, although she died before he married me, because of what I heard him say about her.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3815. 
2- Sawdah bint Zam’ah ibn Qays
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married Sawdah bint Zam’ah ibn Qays (may Allah be pleased with her) in the tenth year of his Prophethood. Tabaqat Ibn Sa’d, narrating from al-Waqidi, 8/52-53; Ibn Kathir in al-Bidayah wa’l-Nihayah, 3/149 
3– ‘Aishah bint Abi Bakr al-Siddiq
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married ‘Aishah bint Abi Bakr al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with her) in Shawwal of the tenth year of the Prophethood. Ibn Sa’d, 8/58-59. She herself said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married me when I was six years old, and consummated the marriage with me when I was nine.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3894; Muslim, 1422. Al-Bukhari (5077) also narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not marry any virgin apart from her. 
4– Hafsah bint ‘Umar
It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that Hafsah’s husband Khunays ibn Hudhafah, who was one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and had been present at Badr, died in Madinah. ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab said: I met ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan and offered Hafsah to him in marriage. I said: If you wish, I will marry Hafsah bint ‘Umar to you. He said: I will think about it. Several nights passed, then he said: I think that I do not want to get married at this time. ‘Umar said: Then I met Abu Bakr and I said: If you wish, I will marry Hafsah bint ‘Umar to you. Abu Bakr kept quiet and did not give me any response. I was more upset about him than about ‘Uthman. Several nights passed, then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) proposed to her and I married her to him. Then Abu Bakr met me and said: Perhaps you felt upset when you offered Hafsah in marriage to me and I did not reply? I said: Yes. He said: Nothing prevented me from responding to your offer but the fact that I knew that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had mentioned her, and I did not want to disclose the secret of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). If he had decided not to marry her, I would have accepted your offer. Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4005. 
5– Zaynab bint Khuzaymah
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married Zaynab bint Khuzaymah (may Allah be pleased with her) in Ramadan, thirty-one months after the Hijrah. Tabaqat Ibn Sa’d, 8/115 
6– Umm Salamah bint Abi Umayyah
Muslim (918) narrated that Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said:  I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “There is no person who is faced with a calamity and says Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji’oon, Allahumma ujurni fi musibati w'ukhluf li khayran minha (Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return; O Allah, reward me in this calamity and compensate me with something better than it) but Allah will reward him in his calamity and will compensate him with something better than that.” She said: When Abu Salamah died, I said what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had commanded me, and Allah compensated me with someone better than him: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
According to another report: when Abu Salamah died, I said: Who is better than Abu Salamah, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? But Allah decreed that I should say it. Then I got married to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
7– Juwayriyah bint al-Harith
Juwayriyah bint al-Harith (may Allah be pleased with her) fell prisoner to the Muslims during the battle of Banu’l-Mustalaq, and she came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to ask him to help her to manumit herself and buy her freedom. He offered to buy her freedom and marry her, and she accepted. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married her and made her manumission her dowry. When the people came to know of that, they set free their own prisoners, so as to honour the in-laws of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). No woman brought a greater blessing to her people than she did. Narrated by Ibn Ishaq with a hasan isnad. Sirat Ibn Hisham, 3/408-409. 
8- Zaynab bint Jahsh
Concerning Zaynab bint Jahsh (may Allah be pleased with her) Allah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So when Zayd had accomplished his desire from her (i.e. divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage, so that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the believers in respect of (the marriage of) the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them (i.e. they have divorced them)” [al-Ahzab 33:37]
She used to boast about this to the other wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), saying: “Your families arranged your marriages but Allah arranged my marriage from above the seven heavens.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 7420. 
9– Umm Habibah bint Abi Sufyan
Abu Dawud (2107) narrated from ‘Urwah from Umm Habibah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she was married to ‘Ubayd-Allah ibn Jahsh, who died in Abyssinia. Then the Negus married her to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and gave her a mahr of four thousand on his behalf, and sent her to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with Shurahbil ibn Hasanah. Classed as sahih by al-Albani.
10- Maymunah bint al-Harith 
It was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married Maymunah when he was in ihram. Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1832; Muslim, 1410. 
The words “when he was in ihram” are a mistake. In fact the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married her after he exited ihram following ‘Umrat al-Qada’. (See Zad al-Ma'ad, 1/113; Fath al-Bari, hadith no. 5114) 
11– Safiyyah bint Huyayy ibn Akhtab
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) set Safiyyah bint Huyayy ibn Akhtab (may Allah be pleased with her) free and married her after the battle of Khaybar. Narrated by al-Bukhari, 371. 
These are the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with whom he consummated marriage. Two of them died during the lifetime of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), namely Khadijah and Zaynab bint Khuzaymah (may Allah be pleased with them both). The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) left behind nine wives when he died; there is no difference of scholarly opinion on this matter. (See Zad al-Ma'ad, 1/105-114)
It was said that Rayhanah bint ‘Amr al-Nadariyyah (or al-Quraziyyah) was also one of his wives. She was taken prisoner during the battle of Bani Qurayzah, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) chose her for himself and married her, then he divorced her then took her back. (Tabaqat Ibn Sa’d , narrating from al-Waqidi, 8/130) 
And it was said that she was a concubine. This was regarded as more likely by Ibn al-Qayyim in Zad al-Ma'ad.

The dhikrs that were narrated from the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) are of two types: 
1 – Those for which a specific number has been narrated, in which case it is obligatory to keep to the number narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), no more and no less – such as the dhikrs to be recited following the prayer, or saying Subhaan-Allaah wa bi hamdih (glory and praise be to Allaah) one hundred times morning and evening, or saying Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu la shareeka lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd, wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadeer (There is no god but Allaah alone, with no partner or associate; His is the Dominion, all praise be to Him, and He is Able to do all things) one hundred times each day, and so on. 
2 – Those for which no specific number has been narrated, such as the general encouragement to say tasbeeh (‘Subhaan-Allaah’ – Glory be to Allaah), tahmeed (‘Al-hamdu Lillaah’ - Praise be to Allaah) and tahleel (‘Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah’ – There is no god but Allaah), and to recite Qur’aan and so on. This may be done in general terms, without keeping to any specific number, as prescribed by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah: 
The basic principle with regard to dhikr and acts of worship is tawqeef (i.e., adhering to what is mentioned and prescribed in the Qur’aan and Sunnah and not worshipping Allaah in any way except that which has been prescribed on the lips of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)). Based on this, in cases where a certain time, number of times, place or manner has been specified, we must worship Allaah in the way that has been proven in sharee’ah. But when Allaah has prescribed dhikrs, du’aa’ and other kinds of worship in general terms without specifying a particular time, number, place or manner, then it is not permissible for us to set limits with regard to the manner, time or number of times. Rather we should worship Him in general terms as it was narrated.

I understand that I must put right any wrong to any Muslim I may have done. What about non-muslims? I have been told that they refuse Islam and so they have no honour. If for example I have stolen from them, should I return this knowing that I may face criminal prosecutions by the non - Muslims? What should I do with those things that belong to non-muslims?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: we congratulate you for having started to pray 
    regularly and your striving to repent, and we give you the glad tidings that 
    Allaah accepts the repentance of the one who repents to Him and He forgives 
    his sins. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “The one who repents from sin is like one who did not sin at all.” Narrated 
    by al-Tirmidhi and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. 

    Secondly: undoubtedly stealing is a major sin and Allaah has 
    stipulated a hadd punishment for it in this world and a severe punishment in 
    the Hereafter. 

    Allaah says (Interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (as for) the male thief and the female 
    thief, cut off (from the wrist joint) their (right) hands as a recompense 
    for that which they committed, a punishment by way of example from Allaah”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:38]

    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “May Allaah curse the thief.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6783 and 
    Muslim, 1687.

     Stealing is haraam whether the person from whom the property 
    is stolen is a Muslim or a kaafir whose life and wealth is protected by 
    sharee’ah. With regard to a kaafir who is at war against the Muslims, it is 
    permissible to take his wealth, because at a time of war that is regarded as 
    taking booty and is not regarded as stealing. 

    Thirdly: with regard to taking a kaafir’s wealth by means of 
    betrayal and cheating, this is haraam, because betrayal is haraam in Islam 
    whether one deceives a Muslim or a kaafir. 

    Al-Bukhaari (2583) narrated from al-Mugheerah ibn Shu’bah 
    that he had accompanied some people during the Jaahiliyyah, and he killed 
    them and took their wealth. Then he came and embraced Islam, and the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “As for your Islam it 
    is accepted, but as for the wealth I want nothing of it.” According to a 
    version narrated by Abu Dawood (2765): “As for your Islam, we accept it, but 
    as for the wealth, it is wealth obtained through betrayal and we have no 
    need of it.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 

    Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said: The words “but as for the wealth I 
    want nothing of it” mean that he did not want it because al-Mugheerah had 
    taken it by means of betrayal. It may be understood from this that it is not 
    permissible to take the wealth of the kuffaar at times of peace by means of 
    betrayal, because friends keep company on a basis of trust, and trusts are 
    to be rendered back to their owners, whether they are Muslims or kaafirs. It 
    is permissible to take the wealth of kaafirs in cases of war, but the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sometimes held onto 
    wealth (instead of distributing it as war booty) in the hope that its owners 
    would become Muslims, then he could return their wealth to them. Fath 
    al-Baari, 5/341. 

    An example of betrayal is when a kaafir has entered a Muslin 
    country in safety, or a Muslim has entered a kaafir country in safety (for 
    example, with a visa), and what this visa implies is that they guarantee 
    that the person’s life and wealth are protected safe, and by the same token 
    they should also be guaranteed that their lives and wealth are safe, so it 
    is not permissible to commit acts of aggression against them or to 
    confiscate or steal their wealth. 
Al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said concerning some people who entered the kaafir land 
    and were in a position to take something of their wealth: If a Muslim man 
    entered dar al-harb in safety (i.e., under the protection of the kaafir 
    authorities), and he is able to take something of their wealth, it is not 
    permissible for him to take anything of it, great or small, because if he is 
    safe from them, then they should be safe from him. And it is forbidden to 
    takes property in several cases: (1) if its owner is Muslim, (2) if the 
    owner is living under the protection of the Islamic state, (3) if the owner 
    has been granted protection for a certain period… 

    Al-Umm, 4/284. 

    Al-Sarkhasi said: It is not proper for a Muslim who has been 
    offered protection to betray them, because betrayal is haraam. 
If he betrays them and 
    takes their wealth and takes it to dar al-islam (the Muslim lands), it is 
    not right for a Muslim to buy it from him if he knows about that, because it 
    has been obtained by evil means, and buying from him will tempt him to do 
    the same thing again, and it is not right for the Muslim to do that. The 
    basic principle regarding this is the hadeeth of al-Mugheerah ibn Shu’bah 
    (may Allaah be pleased with him)…  

    Al-Mabsoot, 10/96. 

    If Allaah enables a Muslim to repent from taking people’s 
    wealth unlawfully, one of the conditions of this repentance is to restore to 
    people what is rightfully theirs, even if they are kaafirs. If there is the 
    fear of exposure or criminal penalties as a result of returning things to 
    their rightful owners, then it is permissible to look for a suitable way of 
    preserving your honour and returning things to their rightful owners without 
    embarrassing yourself, by sending him the money by mail, or asking someone 
    to give it to him without mentioning your name or the fact that you stole 
    it. It is not necessary for the one who wants to return something to its 
    rightful owner to disclose himself or his identity, because the point is 
    that things should be restored to their rightful owners. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If 
    you steal from a person or an organization, then you have to get in touch 
    with the person from whom you stole and tell him, “I have such and such of 
    yours,” then agree on how to settle the matter. But a person may feel that 
    this is too difficult for him and that he cannot go to a person and say, “I 
    stole such and such from you and took such and such from you.” In this case, 
    he can send this money – or whatever – to him in another, indirect way, such 
    as giving it to a friend of this person, and telling him, “This is for So 
    and so,” and telling him the story and saying, “Now I have repented to 
    Allaah, and I hope that you will give it to him.” Fataawa Islamiyyah, 
    4/162.

An Imam in India said, the Zakah for a thing is only once in a lifetime and not yearly. If anybody says that the Zakah is obligatory each year, he must bring the proof from Quran and Hadith.","The Muslims of the earlier and later generations are agreed that zakah must be paid each year on gold, silver and the like.",,"Praise be to Allah.The Muslims of the earlier and later generations are agreed that zakah must be paid each year on gold , silver and the like. 
Ibn Hazm said in Maratib al-Ijma', p. 38: “They are agreed that zakah must be paid repeatedly on all kinds of wealth at the end of each year, apart from crops and fruits, for which they are agreed that zakah must be paid only once.” 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah did not criticize this at all in his criticism of Maratib al-Ijma’. 
The evidence for this consensus is the practice of the ummah from the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) until the present day. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to send the zakah-collectors to the tribes and cities, and they did not differentiate between those who had paid their zakah the previous year and those who had not, rather they used to take the zakah that was due on all the “zakatable” wealth that people possessed. 
Ibn Sirin said: “The zakah-collector used to come and wherever he saw crops or camels or sheep he would take the zakah that was due on them.” (Al-Mudawwanah, 1/361) 
What the person said, that the zakah on gold does not have to be paid each year, is indicative of his ignorance. He has to be taught what is correct. 
The Muslim should not hasten to issue fatwas on the basis of what he thinks, rather he should refer to the sayings of the scholars and imams so that he can find out what scholarly consensus says and not deviate from it.

47096,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47096,At whose hand should change be wrought at a time when the situation of the Muslims contradicts the greatness of their religion?,"This is universal truth that islam is the only religion which is based on justice and solves the problem of humanity especially in the present scenario it is the duty of all muslims to struggle and implement this so that humanity can prosper but unfortunately the muslims have gone to the lowest of the ladder don,t u think ALLAH can choose some other nation to bring the reqd changes because we muslims are behaving hypocritically.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    There is no doubt concerning the universal truth that you 
    have mentioned. Justice between people is a general principle of sharee’ah 
    which applies to everyone, both believer and non-believer, those whom we 
    love and those whom we hate. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Stand 
    out firmly for Allaah as just witnesses; and let not the enmity and hatred 
    of others make you avoid justice. Be just: that is nearer to piety; and fear 
    Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Well‑Acquainted with what you do”
[al-Maa'idah 5:8] 
“So unto this (religion 
    of Islam alone and this Qur’aan) then invite (people) (O Muhammad), and 
    stand firm (on Islamic Monotheism) as you are commanded, and follow not 
    their desires but say: “I believe in whatsoever Allaah has sent down of the 
    Book [all the holy Books,  
    this Qur’aan and the Books of the old from the Tawraat (Torah), or the 
    Injeel (Gospel) or the Pages of Ibraaheem (Abraham)] and I am commanded to 
    do justice among you. Allaah is our Lord and your Lord. For us our deeds and 
    for you your deeds. There is no dispute between us and you. Allaah will 
    assemble us (all), and to Him is the final return”
[al-Shoora 42:15] 

    There is also no doubt that mankind has no hope of being 
    saved from its problems or of being guided and saved from misguidance except 
    through this religion. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Such is Allaah, your Lord in truth. So after the truth, 
    what else can there be, save error? How then are you turned away?”

    [Yoonus 10:32]

     “And if the people of the towns had believed and had the 
    Taqwa (piety), certainly, We should have opened for them blessings from the 
    heaven and the earth, but they belied (the Messengers). So We took them 
    (with punishment) for what they used to earn (polytheism and crimes)”

    [al-A’raaf 7:96]
It is not only that 
    mankind will not prosper if they follow this religion and will be corrupted 
    if they forsake it, because of its justice which encompasses all creatures, 
    rather the most fundamental principles that will enable mankind to prosper 
    is the principle of pure Tawheed, the belief that the Lord of the Worlds is 
    One, on which this religion is based. So there is no submission to any angel 
    or jinn, or to any human being or rock. Just as there cannot be more than 
    one creator for this universe, so too there cannot be more than one 
    controller, who is Allaah, may He be glorified. Allaah says (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 

    “Indeed, your Lord is Allaah, Who created the heavens and 
    the earth in Six Days, and then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne (really in 
    a manner that suits His Majesty). He brings the night as a cover over the 
    day, seeking it rapidly, and (He created) the sun, the moon, the stars 
    subjected to His Command. Surely, His is the creation and commandment. 
    Blessed is Allaah, the Lord of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that 
    exists)!”

    [al-A’raaf 7:54]

    “Had there been therein (in the heavens and the earth) 
    aalihah (gods) besides Allaah, then verily, both would have been ruined. 
    Glorified be Allaah, the Lord of the Throne, (High is He) above all that 
    (evil) they associate with Him!”

    [al-Anbiya’ 21:22]

    Mankind’s deviation from this great principle is the greatest 
    cause of the confusion and misguidance in which they are living and the 
    misery that has overtaken them. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “Say (O Muhammad): ‘Shall we invoke others besides Allaah 
    (false deities), that can do us neither good nor harm, and shall we turn 
    back on our heels after Allaah has guided us (to true Monotheism)? — like 
    one whom the Shayaateen (devils) have made to go astray in the land in 
    confusion, his companions calling him to guidance (saying): Come to us.’  
    Say: ‘Verily, Allaah’s Guidance is the only guidance, and we have been 
    commanded to submit (ourselves) to the Lord of the ‘Aalameen 
    (mankind, jinn and all that exists)’”

    [al-An’aam 6:71]

    “But whosoever turns away from My Reminder (i.e. neither 
    believes in this Qur’aan nor acts on its teachings) verily, for him is a 
    life of hardship, and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of 
    Resurrection.”

    125. He will say: ‘O my Lord! Why have you raised me up 
    blind, while I had sight (before).’

    126. (Allaah) will say: ‘Like this: Our Ayaat (proofs, 
    evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) came unto you, but you 
    disregarded them (i.e. you left them, did not think deeply in them, and you 
    turned away from them), and so this Day, you will be neglected (in the 
    Hell‑fire, away from Allaah’s Mercy).’

    127. And thus do We requite him who transgresses beyond 
    bounds [i.e. commits the great sins and disobeys his Lord (Allaah) and 
    believes not in His Messengers, and His revealed Books, like this Qur’aan], 
    and believes not in the Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, 
    revelations, etc.) of his Lord; and the torment of the Hereafter is far more 
    severe and more lasting”

    [Ta-Ha 20:124-127]

    By Allaah’s wisdom, there are two types of people: believers 
    and disbelievers, obedient and disobedient, and by His wisdom the one is 
    checked by means of the other. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And if Allaah did not check one set of people by means of 
    another, the earth would indeed be full of mischief. But Allaah is full of 
    bounty to the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists)”

    [al-Baqarah 2:251]

    “For had it not been that Allaah checks one set of people 
    by means of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, wherein 
    the Name of Allaah is mentioned much would surely, have been pulled down. 
    Verily, Allaah will help those who help His (Cause). Truly, Allaah is 
    All‑Strong, All‑Mighty”

    [al-Hajj 22:40]

    Allaah is most wise in that, for He distinguishes the sincere 
    from the liar, so that Allaah may know who will support Him (His cause) and 
    His Messengers, and who will oppose Him and wage war against Him. This is 
    the reason behind trials in this life: 

    “but if it had been 
    Allaah’s Will, He Himself could certainly have punished them (without you). 
    But (He lets you fight) in order to test some of you with others. But those 
    who are killed in the way of Allaah, He will never let their deeds be lost”

    [Muhammad 47:4]

    What you have referred to, the fact that many Muslims have 
    gone astray from the teachings of their religion, is true of most Muslims 
    today, except for those on whom their Lord has mercy, the saved group who 
    adhere to the truth. This is the greatest trial that we are faced with at 
    this time, and it is the cause of the weakness and humiliation that the 
    Muslims are suffering from, and their being dominated by their enemies. The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When you 
    enter into the ‘aynah transaction, hold onto the
    tails of oxen, are content with agriculture, and give
    up jihad, Allaahwill cause disgrace to prevail over 
    you, and will notwithdraw it until you return to 
    your (true) religion.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 3462; classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani in al-Saheehah, 11. 

    Allaah has warned His slaves in more than one verse of His 
    Book, of the punishment for being negligent with regard to their religion 
    and of being careless with regard to the trust that He has placed on their 
    shoulders. He has warned them that the consequences of that will come back 
    on them, and the loss will be theirs. As for the religion of Allaah, it is 
    protected by Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Muhammad is no more than 
    a Messenger, and indeed (many) Messengers have passed away before him. If he 
    dies or is killed, will you then turn back on your heels (as disbelievers)? 
    And he who turns back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to Allaah; 
    and Allaah will give reward to those who are grateful”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:144]

    When the lazy generation moves on, those who away from the 
    battlefield and neglected their trust, then will come the turn of those who 
    are chosen for this mission, whom Allaah has honoured by entrusting them 
    with His religion: 

    “O you who believe! Whoever from among you turns back from 
    his religion (Islam), Allaah will bring a people whom He will love and they 
    will love Him; humble towards the believers, stern towards the disbelievers, 
    fighting in the way of Allaah, and never fear of the blame of the blamers. 
    That is the Grace of Allaah which He bestows on whom He wills. And Allaah is 
    All‑Sufficient for His creatures’ needs, All‑Knower”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:54]

    “Behold! You are those who are called to spend in the 
    Cause of Allaah, yet among you are some who are niggardly. And whoever is 
    niggardly, it is only at the expense of his ownself. But Allaah is Rich 
    (Free of all needs), and you (mankind) are poor. And if you turn away (from 
    Islam and the obedience to Allaah), He will exchange you for some other 
    people and they will not be your likes”

    [Muhammad 47:38]

    But we reiterate that this new generation will be from among 
    the Muslims themselves, not from any other nation. There will not be angels 
    who come down to take up the mission that people have neglected.  

    There will not be a miracle that makes lazy people 
    victorious.  And there will never be a generation among the kuffaar who 
    support the religion of Allaah. Allaah and His religion have no supporters 
    and helpers except the pious. When that generation comes, then will come the 
    help of Allaah: 

    “O you who believe! If you help (in the cause of) Allaah, 
    He will help you, and make your foothold firm”

    [Muhammad 47:7]

    It is up to us to renew ourselves, to train our children and 
    families, to call others, so that we will be part of this generation or at 
    least a step in the right direction. 

    We ask Allaah to help us to do that which He loves and which 
    pleases Him and to support His religion through us. And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
