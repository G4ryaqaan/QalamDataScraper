21401,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21401,Well-off people taking things that are only for the poor from a kaafir state,"In USA, some Muslims request food stamps -which are assigned to poor people- while they have enough money. They hide their bank accounts information to be eligible for these stamps. When I advised them, they told me that it is not haram because they dont take money from an Islamic country! Is that correct?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    It is not permissible for you to stay in a 
    kaafir country unless you have a valid shar’i reason and fulfil the 
    conditions set out by sharee’ah. These have already been explained several 
    times. Please see Question #12866 
    and 6154. 

    Secondly: 

    It is not permissible for those who are not 
    entitled to take these food stamps, whether that is from a Muslim country or 
    from a kaafir country, because the one who takes them in this case comes 
    under the ruling on one who tells lies, and Allaah and His Messenger have 
    forbidden telling lies. 

    It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “The signs of the hypocrite are three: when he speaks he lies, when he makes 
    a promise he breaks it and when he is entrusted with something he betrays 
    that trust.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 33; Muslim 59). 

    It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood 
    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Truthfulness leads to righteousness, and righteousness leads to Paradise. A man will keep on telling the truth until he becomes a siddeeq (one 
    who speaks the truth). Lying leads to evildoing and evildoing leads to Hell. 
    A man will keep on telling lies until he is recorded with Allaah as a liar.” 
    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5743; Muslim, 2607). 

    This also involves consuming people’s 
    property unlawfully. 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And 
    eat up not one another’s property unjustly”

    [al-Baqarah 2:188]
It is not permissible for a Muslim to 
    ask people for money when he has no need of it. Muslim narrated in his 
    Saheeh (no. 1041) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said: “Whoever asks the people for money in order to amass more 
    wealth is asking for a burning coal, so let him ask for less or more.” What 
    this means is asking so that he may accumulate a large amount when he does 
    not need to. This was stated by al-Haafiz. 

    Thirdly: 

    Muslims should be above doing such 
    reprehensible deeds which are not only damage their own image and reputation 
    but that of their religion as well, for this action may be a cause of the 
    kaafirs attacking their religion or criticizing it. 

    Allaah praises those who are poor but do not 
    ask people for anything. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “(Charity is) for Fuqaraa’ (the poor), who 
    in Allaah’s Cause are restricted (from travel), and cannot move about in the 
    land (for trade or work). The one who knows them not, thinks that they are 
    rich because of their modesty. You may know them by their mark, they do not 
    beg of people at all. And whatever you spend in good, surely, Allaah knows 
    it well”

    [al-Baqarah 2:273]
So what about one who is not poor and is 
    not in need, but he asks or begs from people? Could this be something 
    praiseworthy and commendable?

Cupping in Islam has real benefits in treating many diseases.,"Linguistic meaning of cupping 


Technical meaning of cupping


History of cupping


How cupping is done","Praise be to Allah.Linguistic meaning of cupping 
The word hijamah (cupping) comes from the word hajm which means sucking, as in the phrase hajama al-sabiy thadya ummihi (the infant suckled his mother’s breast). 
Al-Hajjam means the cupper, hijamah is the profession of cupping, and the word mihjam is used to describe the vessel in which the blood is collected and the lancet used by the cupper. (See Lisan al-‘Arab). 
Technical meaning of cupping
In fiqh terminology the word hijamah is applied by some scholars to the extraction of blood from the nape of the neck by means of cupping after making an incision with the lancet. Al-Zarqani stated that cupping is not limited to the nape of the neck, rather it may be done on any part of the body . This was also the view of al-Khattabi. 
In conclusion, hijamah refers to the extraction of blood from the body by means of cupping using a suitable vessel or whatever modern equipment that serves the same purpose. 
History of cupping
Cupping has been known since ancient times. It was known to the Chinese, the Babylonians and the Pharaohs. Their relics and carved images indicate that they used cupping to treat some diseases. At first they used metal cups or bulls’ horns, from which they would remove the air by sucking it out after placing the cup on the skin. Then they used glass cups from which they would remove the air by burning a piece of cotton or wool inside the cup. 
Virtues of cupping:
Al-Bukhari narrated in his Sahih (5269) from Sa’id ibn Jubayr from Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Healing is in three things: drinking honey, the incision of a cupper, and cauterizing with fire, but I forbid my ummah to use cauterizing.” 
Al-Bukhari (5263) and Muslim (2952) narrated that Anas ibn Malik was asked about the earnings of the cupper, and he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was treated with cupping by Abu Taybah. He ordered that he should be given two sa’ of food, and he spoke with his masters so that they reduced what they used to take from his earnings. And he said: “The best medicine with which you treat yourselves is cupping, or it is one of the best of your medicines.” 
Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “If there is anything good in the medicines with which you treat yourselves, it is in the incision of the cupper, or a drink of honey or cauterization with fire, but I do not like to be cauterized.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6583; Muslim, 2205). 
Benefits of cupping:
Cupping has real benefits in treating many diseases, past and present. The diseases which have been treated by cupping and for which it has been of benefit by Allah’s Leave include the following: 

Circulatory diseases
Treating blood pressure and infection of the heart muscle
Diseases of the chest and trachea
Headache and pains in the eyes
Pain in the neck and stomach, and rheumatic pain in the muscles
Some diseases of the heart and chest, and pain in the joints

In addition, cupping may offer a unique treatment which may reduce pain, and it does not have any side-effects. For more information on the benefits of cupping, please see Zad al-Ma’ad by Ibn al-Qayyim, 4/52, and al-Hijamah: Ahkamuha wa Fawaiduha by Ibrahim al-Hazimi.  
How cupping is done
The mouth of the cupping vessel (nowadays they use glass vessels) is placed on the skin at the site chosen for cupping. Then the cupper rarefies the air inside the vessel by burning a small piece of paper or cotton inside the vessel, so that the mouth of the vessel will cling to the skin. Sometimes a machine is used instead of the method described above. The vessel clings to the skin and is left for a period of three to ten minutes. Then it is lifted off and a very small incision is made in the skin using a clean sharp instrument such as a razor blade or the like. Then the cup is put back in the same manner as described above, until it is filled with the bad blood that comes out of the veins. Then it is taken off, and may be put back once more if needed. When it is finished and the cup is taken away, a dry dressing is placed over the site of the incision. (See Mabahith fi’l-Jarahah al-Sughra wa’l-Takhdir by Prof. Dr. Nazmi al-Qabbani). 
Before ending we should point out that no one should undertake cupping except one who can do it well, because of the harm that may result if it is done by one who is incompetent.

    This child is illegitimate, i.e., the child of zina

21413,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21413,A number of questions about divorce,"I have three urgent and, I believe,very imporatant questions about Divorce (Talaq). 

1.  Is what is known in the west as SEPARATION permitted in Islam?   A muslim husband and wife with children living in the west are seriously considering divorce.  Somebody suggested trying Separation first.  The husband would move out to a place nearby but since they are still married there would be no problem comming in the house at any time.   He would still continue to support the family in every respect.

2.  For consummated marriage and with first Talaq, when does Eddah end?   Is it the end of the third period (bleeding) or the beginning of the fourth one? 

3.  What is permitted during Eddah that would not constitute end of Talaq?  I know that sexual intercourse is not, but is kissing, touching and hugging ok?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    With regard to the first question, the answer depends on the 
    circumstances. If what is intended by this action is to reduce the level of 
    tension in the relationship, then they will come back together, or as a 
    trial separation to see what effect that will have on them and their 
    children so that it will help them to take a decision, and they both agree 
    to this temporary separation, then there is nothing wrong with that. 

    If this is a decision that they have both taken, and have 
    agreed to separate from one another without divorcing, then it should be 
    said that if the woman foregoes the rights that she will lose through this 
    separation, and he also foregoes his rights over her, and they think that 
    this is in their best interests and those of their children, and the place 
    where the woman and her children will stay is a safe place where they will 
    not suffer neglect, then that is permissible, subject to these conditions. 
    But if she wants intimacy and he does not want to do that, or there is the 
    fear that she may do something wrong whilst she is still married to him, and 
    the like, then he should divorce her, but still continue to spend on his 
    children. And Allaah knows best. 

    With regard to the second question: the ‘iddah of a divorced 
    woman who has periods, with whom the marriage has been consummated and who 
    is not pregnant, is a matter concerning which classical and contemporary 
    scholars have differed. The view which is regarded as most correct by the 
    majority of contemporary scholars, such as Shaykh Ibn Baaz and Ibn 
    ‘Uthaymeen, and others, is that the ‘iddah ends when three menstrual periods 
    have passed, and as soon as the third period ends, the ‘iddah ends. This is 
    the view of many of the major Sahaabah such as ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, ‘Ali 
    ibn Abi Taalib and Ibn Mas’ood, and it was narrated by Ibn al-Qayyim from 
    Abu Bakr, Abu Moosa and others (may Allaah be pleased with them all). (See
    Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/310; Fataawa al-Talaaq by Shaykh 
    Ibn Baaz, 193; Jaami’ Ahkaam al-Nisa’, 4/243).
    With regard to the third question: “The women whose divorce is revocable 
    (i.e., first or second talaaq) may uncover in front of her husband and adorn 
    herself and wear make-up and perfume. She may speak to him and he may speak 
    to her; she may sit with him and do anything with him apart from intercourse 
    and the things that lead to it; that may only happen when he takes her back. 
    (Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/310) 
If he kisses and embraces 
    his wife with the intention of taking her back, then that taking back is 
    valid, with no difference of opinion among the scholars. But if he does not 
    intend to take her back, then some scholars say that it is permissible on 
    the grounds that she is his wife, but that it does not mean that he has 
    taken her back; other scholars say that embracing and kissing etc. are 
    precursors to intercourse, so the one who does them is sinning if he does 
    not intend to take her back. To be on the safe side, he should not do that 
    until after he has clearly stated that he is taking her back, such as saying 
    to his wife, “I am taking you back,” and two Muslim witnesses bear witness 
    to his taking her back by him saying in front of them, “I ask you to bear 
    witness that I am taking my wife So and so back,” and the like. Then he may 
    do whatever he likes of permissible things. And Allaah knows best.

The people in the mosque used to leave it open 24 Hours. Every day I go to pray Fajr, I found homeless people sleep in the mosque, turning the air-condition very high (we pay several thousands of dollars for electricity), as well as non-moslims, we found bottles of alchohols and few days ago, we found a drunk person sleeping in the bathroom of the mosque and we called the police to take him away. I suggested to close the mosque from inside as well as the gates outside between after Isha prayers (one or two hours after Isha) untill fajr prayers and give keys to most of people who come to pray Isha and Fajr including some students who used to study in the mosque at night. We bought locks and keys and start to lock the mosque daily. Some brothers dislike the idea and their argument is that we should close the doors of the mosque from inside and leave the outside gate open because the house of Allah should be opened 24 hours, and if some body come late at night after time of Isha prayers and he would like to pray, he will not be able to do so.

Is it true that Abu Hanifa's madhab is the most followed in the Muslim world?","It is not obligatory for a Muslim to follow any particular madhhab among the four madhhabs. The madhhab of Abu Hanifah is the most widespread madhhab among the Muslims. Every Muslim should follow the truth and what is correct, regardless of who says it.","Is it obligatory to follow a madhhab?


Which madhhab is the most popular?","Praise be to Allah.Is it obligatory to follow a madhhab?
It is not obligatory for a Muslim to follow any particular madhhab among the four madhhabs. People vary in their level of understanding and ability to derive rulings from the evidence. There are some for whom it is permissible to follow (taqlid ), and indeed it may be obligatory in their case. There are others who can only follow the Shar`i evidence. 
In Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, this question was answered in a detailed manner, which is worth quoting here in full. 
Question: 
What is the ruling on following one of the four madhhabs in all cases and situations? 
The Committee replied: 
“Firstly: the four madhhabs are named after the four imams – Imam Abu Hanifah, Imam Malik, Imam al-Shafi'i and Imam Ahmad. 
Secondly: These imams learned fiqh (jurisprudence) from the Quran and Sunnah, and they are mujtahidin in this regard. The mujtahid either gets it right, in which case he will have two rewards, the reward for his ijtihad and the reward for getting it right, or he will get it wrong, in which case he will be rewarded for his ijtihad and will be forgiven for his mistake. 
Thirdly: the one who is able to derive rulings from the Quran and Sunnah should take from them like those who came before him; it is not right for him to follow blindly (taqlid) when he believes that the truth lies elsewhere. Rather he should follow that which he believes is the truth. It is permissible for him to follow in matters in which he is unable to come to a conclusion based on the Quran and Sunnah and he needs guidelines concerning a particular issue. 
Fourthly:  Whoever does not have the ability to derive rulings himself is permitted to follow one whom he feels comfortable following. If he is not comfortable following him then he should ask until he finds someone with whom he is comfortable.  
Fifthly:  From the above it is clear that we should not follow their opinions in all situations and at all times, because they may make mistakes, but we may follow their views that are sound and are based on the evidence.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah, 5/28 )
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah, no. 3323: 
“Whoever is qualified to derive rulings from the Quran and Sunnah, and has strong knowledge in that regard, even if that is with the help of the legacy of fiqh that we have inherited from earlier scholars of Islam, has the right to do that, so he can act upon it himself and explain it in disputes and issue fatwas to those who consult him. Whoever is not qualified to do that has to ask trustworthy people so that he may learn the rulings from their books and act upon that, without limiting his asking or his reading to one of the scholars of the four madhhabs. Rather people refer to the four imams because they are so well known and their books are well written and widely available. 
Whoever says that it is obligatory for the learned people to follow the scholars blindly in all cases is making a mistake and being inflexible, and is thinking that these learned people are inadequate, and he is restricting something that is broad in scope. 
Whoever says that we should limit following to the four madhhabs is also mistaken, because he is restricting something that is broad in scope with no evidence for doing so. With regard to the common (i.e., uneducated) man there is no difference between the four imams and others such as al-Layth ibn Sa’d, al-Awza’i and other fuqaha.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah, 5/41) 
It says in Fatwa no. 1591: 
“None of them called people to follow his madhhab, or was partisan in following it, or obliged anyone else to act in accordance with it or with a specific madhhab. Rather they used to call people to follow the Quran and Sunnah, and they would comment on the texts of Islam, and explain its basic principles and discuss minor issues according to general guidelines, and issue fatwas concerning what people asked about, without obliging any of their students or anyone else to follow their views. Rather they criticized those who did that and said that their opinions should be cast aside if they went against a sahih hadith. One of them said: “If the hadith is sahih then that is my madhhab.” May Allah have mercy on them all. 
It is not obligatory for anyone to follow a particular madhhab, rather we should strive to learn the truth if possible, or to seek the help of Allah in doing so, then to rely on the legacy that the earlier Muslim scholars left behind for those who came after them, thus making it easier for them to understand and apply the texts. Whoever cannot derive rulings from the texts etc for some reason that prevents him from doing so should ask trustworthy scholars for whatever rulings of shari’ah he needs, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So ask the people of the Reminder [Scriptures — the Tawrat (Torah), the Injil (Gospel)] if you do not know” [al-Anbiya 21:7]
So he has to strive to ask one whom he trusts among those who are well known for their knowledge, virtue, piety and righteousness.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 5/56 )
Which madhhab is the most popular?
The madhhab of Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him) is the most widespread madhhab among the Muslims, and perhaps one of the reasons for that is that the Ottoman caliphs followed this madhhab and they ruled the Muslim lands for more than six centuries. That does not mean that the madhhab of Abu Hanifah is the most sound madhhab or that every ijtihad in it is correct, rather like other madhhabs, it contains some things that are correct and some that are incorrect. What the believer must do is to follow the truth and what is correct, regardless of who says it.”

21421,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21421,"If my husband takes a second wife, will I be rewarded?","What is the reward, ""ajr"", for the first wife having patience ,""sabr"", when her husband takes a second wife? Is there a special reward in this case, or is it the same reward for all women who obey their husbands and make their religious duties? If I would get to know about a special reward, things would be easier to accept. Someone said that the reward for this kind of woman was more than the reward for a mu´min leaving for jihad. And since Hajj is the jihad of a woman, accepting polygamy for the first wife is more than jihad. Is ther daleel for this, or do you know about another reward?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    We do not know of any saheeh evidence which refers to the 
    reward mentioned, but al-Tabaraani narrated from Ibn Mas’ood that the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah has 
    decreed jealousy for women and jihad for men, so whoever bears that with 
    patience out of faith and in the hope of reward will have a reward like that 
    of a martyr.” This hadeeth was classed as da’eef (weak) by al-Albaani in 
    Da’eef al-Jaami’ al-Sagheer, no. 1626. 

    Secondly: 

    A woman’s being patient in obeying her husband is one of the 
    means of entering Paradise, as it says in the hadeeth narrated by Ibn 
    Hibbaan: “If a woman offers her five daily prayers and fasts her month 
    (i.e., Ramadaan) and guards her chastity and obeys her husband, it will be 
    said to her: ‘Enter Paradise from whichever of the gates of Paradise you 
    wish.’” This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh 
    al-Jaami’ al-Sagheer, no. 660. 

    Her patience in putting up with her husband’s marrying a 
    second wife will bring a special reward over and above that, for several 
    reasons: 

    1 – Her husband’s marrying another wife is regarded as a test 
    and trial for her, and if she bears that with patience she will have the 
    reward for being patient in the face of a trial, as Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Only those who are patient shall receive their reward in 
    full, without reckoning”
    [al-Zumar 39:10]

    According to the hadeeth: “No fatigue, nor disease, nor 
    sorrow, nor sadness, nor hurt, nor distress befalls a Muslim, not even a 
    thorn that pricks him, but Allaah will expiate his sins thereby.” 

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5642; Muslim, 2573, from the hadeeth 
    of Abu Sa’eed and Abu Hurayrah. 

    Al-Tirmidhi (2399) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Trials will 
    continue to befall the believer, man or woman, concerning himself, his child 
    and his wealth, until he meets Allaah with no sin on him.” Classed as saheeh

    2 – If a woman accepts that and treats her husband and the 
    other wife well, she will have the reward of al-muhsineen. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Verily, he who fears Allaah with obedience to Him (by 
    abstaining from sins and evil deeds, and by performing righteous good 
    deeds), and is patient, then surely, Allaah makes not the reward of the 
    Muhsinoon (good‑doers) to be lost”
    [Yoosuf 12:90] 

    “Is there any reward for good other than good?”

    [al-Rahmaan 55:60] 

    “And verily, Allaah is with the Muhsinoon (good-doers)”

    [al-‘Ankaboot 29:69]

    3 – If she feels angry because of that, but she controls her 
    anger – and controlling one's tongue is part of controlling one's anger – 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “…who repress anger, and who pardon men; verily, Allaah 
    loves Al-Muhsinoon (the good‑doers)”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:134]

    This reward is in addition to the woman’s reward for obeying 
    her husband under ordinary circumstances. 

    A wise woman should accept whatever Allaah decrees for her, 
    and she should realize that her husband’s marrying another woman is 
    something permissible, so she should not object to it. It may be that this 
    (second) marriage will make him more chaste and prevent him from doing 
    something haraam. 

    It is very unfortunate that some women object less to their 
    husbands doing haraam things than to their marrying another woman in a 
    permissible manner. This is a sign of their lack of reason and religious 
    commitment. 

    Women should follow the good example of the wives of the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions, 
    who were patient and sought reward even though many of them felt jealous. If 
    your husband goes ahead and takes a second wife then you have to be patient 
    and content and treat him well so that you can attain the reward of the 
    patient and the doers of good. 

    Note that this life is the life of trials and tests, and how 
    quickly it ends. So congratulations to the one who is patient in obeying Allaah in this life until he attains eternal delight in the gardens of Paradise.

21434,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21434,The reward of one whose child dies and he bears that with patience,"What is the reward parents recieve for being patient and thanking Allah, when they have an infant or child die?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    There are many texts in the Qur’aan and Sunnah which point to 
    the virtue and great reward of those who are patient and state that Allaah 
    will give them reward without measure. This includes everyone who bears with 
    patience any calamity with which he is tested. Undoubtedly the loss of a 
    child is one of the greatest calamities for the one whom it befalls. Whoever 
    bears that with patience and accepts the will and decree of Allaah will have 
    a great reward by the grace and bounty of Allaah. There follow some of these 
    texts, which we hope will be of consolation to you in your time of 
    calamity: 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): 

    “And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, 
    hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to As- 
    Saabiroon (the patient). 

    Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: ‘Truly, to Allaah 
    we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.’

    They are those on whom are the Salawaat (i.e. who are 
    blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) 
    receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones”

    [al-Baqarah 2:155-157]

    “And Allaah loves As-Saabiroon (the patient)”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:146] 

    “Only those who are patient shall receive their reward in 
    full, without reckoning”

    [al-Zumar 39:10]

    And there are many similar verses. 

    There are also many ahaadeeth, including the following: 

    Muslim (5318) narrated that Suhayb said: The Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “How wonderful 
    is the affair of the believer, for his affair is all good, and this applies 
    to no one except the believer. If something good happens to him, he gives 
    thanks and that is good for him, and if something bad happens to him, he 
    bears it with patience, and that is good for him.” This has to do with the 
    virtues of patience in general. 

    There are also ahaadeeth which speak specifically of losing a 
    child. For example: 

    Al-Tirmidhi (942) narrated that Abu Sinaan said: I buried my 
    son Sinaan and Abu Talhah al-Khoolaani was sitting at the graveside. When I 
    wanted to go out he took my hand and said, “Shall I not give you some glad 
    tidings, O Abu Sinaan?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “Al-Dahhaak ibn ‘Abd 
    al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Arzab narrated to me from Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari that the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “When a person’s child dies, Allaah says to His angels, ‘You have taken the 
    child of My slave.’ They say, ‘Yes.’ He says, ‘You have taken the apple of 
    his eye.’ They say, ‘Yes.’ He says, ‘What did My slave say?’ They say, ‘He 
    praised you and said “Innaa lillaahi wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon (Verily 
    to Allaah we belong and unto Him is our return).’ Allaah says, ‘Build for My 
    slave a house in Paradise and call it the house of praise.’” 

    (Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 
    1408) 

    It was narrated in al-Saheehayn that there is a 
    special reward for the person whose child dies but he bears that with 
    patience and hopes for reward. It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed (may Allaah 
    be pleased with him) that the women said to the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Give us a day (to teach us),” So he 
    preached to them and said, “Any woman who loses three of her children, they 
    will be a shield for her against the Fire.” A woman said, “And two?” He 
    said, “And two.” 

    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 99; Muslim, 4786) 

    According to a report narrated by al-Bukhaari (1292), Anas 
    ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no Muslim 
    who loses three of his children before they reach the age of puberty, but 
    Allaah will admit him to Paradise by virtue of His Mercy towards them.” 

    These ahaadeeth explain that if two or more of a person’s 
    children die and he bears that with patience, then he is promised Paradise 
    and salvation from the Fire. 

    Our Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    taught us a du’aa’ to say at times of calamity, in which there is virtue and 
    great reward. Muslim narrated in his Saheeh (1525) that Umm Salamah 
    said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) say, “There is no Muslim who is afflicted with a calamity and says 
    that which Allaah has enjoined, Innaa lillaahi wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon. 
    Allaahumma ajurni fi museebati wakhluf li khayran minha (Verily to 
    Allaah we belong and unto Him is our return. O Allaah, reward me for my 
    calamity and compensate me with something better than it), but Allaah will 
    compensate him with something better than it.” She said, When Abu Salamah 
    died, I said, who among the Muslims is better than Abu Salamah, the first 
    household to migrate to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him)? Then I said these words, and Allaah compensated me with 
    the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).

    loss, and to compensate you with something better. And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A

A related question is, was this Hadith not available to Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him) at his time?

Hadiths about not raising hands in prayer


Ruling on raising hands in prayer","Praise be to Allah.Reported Hadith about raising hands in prayer
The Hadith to which the questioner refers was narrated by Al-Bukhari (735) and Muslim (390) from `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to raise his hands to shoulder level when he started to pray, when he said “Allahu akbar” before bowing in Ruku`, and when he raised his head from Ruku`. 
The majority of scholars followed this Hadith and said that it is recommended for the worshipper to raise his hands at the points mentioned in the Hadith . 
Imam Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) wrote a separate book on this issue which he called Juz’ fi Raf` Al-Yadayn (Section on Raising the Hands), in which he proved that the hands should be raised at these two points on the prayer, and he strongly denounced those who go against that. He narrated that Al-Hasan (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to raise their hands during prayer when they bowed and when they stood up (from bowing).” Al-Bukhari said, “Al-Hasan did not exclude any of the Companions from that, and it was not proven that any one among the Sahabah did not raise his hands.” (See Al-Majmu` by An-Nawawi, 3/399-406)
Hadiths about not raising hands in prayer
We do not know whether the Hadiths about raising the hands reached Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him) or not, but they did reach his followers. But they did not follow them because they had other Hadiths and reports which said that the hands should not be raised except when saying “Allahu akbar” at the beginning of the prayer. 
These Hadiths include the following:  
The Hadith narrated by Abu Dawud (749) from Al-Bara’ ibn `Azib (may Allah be pleased with him), which says that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to raise his hands almost to his ears when he started to pray, then he did not repeat (this action).
The Hadith narrated by Abu Dawud (748) from `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “Shall I not lead you in prayer as the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did?” Then he prayed and he only raised his hands once. (See Nasb Ar-Rayah by Az-Zayla`i, 1/393-407) 
But these Hadiths were classed as inauthentic by the Imams of Hadith. 
The Hadith of Al-Bara’ was classed as inauthentic by Sufyan ibn `Uyaynah, Ash-Shafi`i, Al-Humaydi the shaykh of Al-Bukhari, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Yahya ibn Ma`in, Ad-Darimi, Al-Bukhari, and others. 
The Hadith of Ibn Mas`ud was classed as inauthentic by `Abdullah ibn Al-Mubarak, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Al-Bukhari, Al-Bayhaqi, Ad-Daraqutni and others. Similarly, the reports which were narrated from some of the Companions about not raising the hands are all inauthentic. We have quoted above the words of Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him): “…it was not proven that any one among the Companions did not raise his hands.” (See Talkhis Al-Habir by Al-Hafidh ibn Hajar, 1/221-223) 
Ruling on raising hands in prayer
Once it is proven that these Hadiths and reports which say that the hands should not be raised are inauthentic, then the Hadiths which say that the hands should be raised remain strong with no opposing reports. 
Hence the believer should not fail to raise his hands at the points in prayer described in the Sunnah. He should strive to make his prayer like the prayer of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said, “Pray as you have seen me praying.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 631)
Hence `Ali ibn Al-Madini (may Allah have mercy on him), the shaykh of Al-Bukhari, said: “It is the duty of the Muslims to raise their hands when they bow in Ruku` and when they stand up from Ruku`.” Al-Bukhari said: “`Ali was the most knowledgeable of the people of his time.” 
Once the Sunnah has been explained clearly, no one has the right to ignore it, following whoever among the scholars said that.  Imam Ash-Shafi` (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The scholars are agreed that if the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) becomes clear to a person, it is not permissible for him to ignore it in favour of the opinion of anyone.” (Madarij As-Salikin, 2/335) 
“If a man is following Abu Hanifah or Malik or Ash-Shafi`i or Ahmad, and he sees that the view of another Madhhab concerning a given matter is stronger, and he follows that, then he has done well, and that does not detract from his religious commitment or good character. There is no scholarly dispute on this point. Rather this is more in accordance with the truth and is more beloved by Allah and His Messenger.” (Said by Shaykh Al-Islam – may Allah have mercy on him – in Al-Fatawa, 22/247)
The scholars who said that the hands should not be raised based on their own Ijtihad are to be excused, for they will be rewarded for their Ijtihad and their seeking the truth, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If a judge passes judgement based on his own Ijtihad and he is correct, he will have two rewards; if he passes judgement based on his own Ijtihad and he makes a mistake, he will have one reward.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 7352; Muslim, 1716) (See Raf` Al-Malam `an Al-A’immah Al-A`lam by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah)
Note: 
There is a fourth place where it is recommended to raise the hands during prayer; that is when standing up after the first Tashahhud for the third Rak`ah.

What other metals, other than gold, are prohibited for men?","The engagement ring is a kind of ring, and there is nothing wrong with rings in principle, unless that is accompanied by the belief that this will create strong bonds between the couple.","Can men wear gold?


Are wedding rings haram?


Why are wedding rings haram?","Praise be to Allah.Can men wear gold?
With regard to men wearing gold , whether it is a ring or anything else, it is not permissible under any circumstances. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade gold for the males of this ummah. He saw a man wearing a ring of gold and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took it from his hand and said, “Would any one of you take a coal from the fire and hold it in his hand?” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Libas wa’l-Zinah, 3897)
So it is not permissible for the Muslim male to wear a gold ring. 
But with regard to rings of silver or any other kind of metal, it is permissible for men to wear them even if they are precious metals. 
Are wedding rings haram?
With regard to the wedding ring, which is worn on the occasion of marriage, this is not one of the customs of the Muslims. If it is believed that it generates love between the spouses, and that taking it off and not wearing it will have an effect on the marital relationship, then this is regarded as a form of shirk and is a kind of jahili belief. Based on the above, it is not permissible to wear a wedding ring under any circumstances. 
Why are wedding rings haram?

Firstly, because it is an imitation of those who are no good; it is a custom that has come to the Muslims from the non-Muslims.
Secondly, if that is accompanied by the belief that it has an effect on the marital relationship, then this is a kind of shirk. La hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah (there is no power and no strength except with Allah). (From a fatwa issued by Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan). 

Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin was asked about the ruling on wearing engagement rings. He said: 
“The engagement ring is a kind of ring, and there is nothing wrong with rings in principle, unless that is accompanied by some belief, as some people do when the man writes his name on the ring that he gives to his fiancée, and she writes her name on the ring that she gives to him, believing that this will create strong bonds between the couple. In this case, this ring is haram, because it is an attachment to something for which there is no basis in Islam and which makes no sense. Similarly, with regard to the engagement ring, it is not permissible to the man to put it on his fiancée’s hand, because she is not his wife yet and she is still a stranger (non-mahram) to him, because she is not his wife until after the marriage contract has been done.” (Al-Fatawa al-Jami’ah li’l-Marah al-Muslimah, vol. 3, p. 914-915)

    It was narrated from the Prophet (peace and 
    blessings of Allah be upon him) that women will form the majority of the 
    people of Hell. It was narrated from ‘Imran ibn Husayn that the Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I looked into Paradise and 
    I saw that the majority of its people were the poor. And I looked into Hell 
    and I saw that the majority of its people are women.”

    (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3241; Muslim, 
    2737) 

    With regard to the reason for this, the 
    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about it and he 
    explained the reason. 

    It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abbas 
    (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and 
    blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I was shown Hell and I have never 
    seen anything more terrifying than it. And I saw that the majority of its 
    people are women.” They said, “Why, O Messenger of Allah?” He said, “Because 
    of their ingratitude (kufr).” It was said, “Are they ungrateful to Allah?” 
    He said, “They are ungrateful to their companions (husbands) and ungrateful 
    for good treatment. If you are kind to one of them for a lifetime then she 
    sees one (undesirable) thing in you, she will say, ‘I have never had 
    anything good from you.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1052) 

    It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri 
    (may Allah be pleased with him) said:  

    “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings 
    of Allah be upon him) went out to the musalla (prayer place) on the day of 
    Eid al-Adha or Eid al-Fitr. He passed by the women and said, ‘O women! Give 
    charity, for I have seen that you form the majority of the people of Hell.’ 
    They asked, ‘Why is that, O Messenger of Allah?’  He replied, ‘You curse 
    frequently and are ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen anyone more 
    deficient in intelligence and religious commitment than you. A cautious 
    sensible man could be led astray by some of you.’ The women asked, ‘O 
    Messenger of Allah, what is deficient in our intelligence and religious 
    commitment?’ He said, ‘Is not the testimony of two women equal to the 
    testimony of one man?’ They said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘This is the deficiency in 
    her intelligence. Is it not true that a woman can neither pray nor fast 
    during her menses?’ The women said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘This is the deficiency 
    in her religious commitment.’” 

    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 304) 

    It was narrated that Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah 
    (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I attended Eid prayers with the 
    Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He started 
    with the prayer before the khutbah (sermon), with no adhan (call to prayer) 
    or iqamah (final call to prayer). Then he stood up, leaning on Bilal (may 
    Allah be pleased with him), speaking of fear of Allah (taqwa) and urging us 
    to obey Him. He preached to the people and reminded them. Then he went over 
    to the women and preached to them and reminded them. Then he said, ‘Give in 
    charity, for you are the majority of the fuel of Hell. A woman with dark 
    cheeks stood up in the midst of the women and said, ‘Why is that, O 
    Messenger of Allah?’ He said, ‘Because you complain too much and are 
    ungrateful to your husbands.’ Then they started to give their jewellery in 
    charity, throwing their earrings and rings into Bilal’s cloak.”

    (Narrated by Muslim, 885) 

    Our believing sisters who learn of this 
    hadeeth should behave like those Sahabiyat (female Companions) who, when 
    they learned of this, did good deeds which would be the means, by Allah’s 
    leave, of keeping them far away from being included in that majority of the 
    inhabitants of Hell. 

    So our advice to the sisters is to strive to 
    adhere to the rituals and obligatory duties of Islam, especially prayer, and 
    to keep away from that which Allah has forbidden, especially shirk in its 
    many forms which is widespread among women, such as seeking one's needs from 
    someone other than Allah, going to practitioners of witchcraft and 
    fortune-tellers, etc.

21459,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21459,The reason why plural marriage is permitted for men but not for women,"I have some questions about Islam, could you explain them for me? I think that Islam allows a man to marry more than one wife if he is able to take care of them in all in all aspects. Does Islam allow a woman to have more than one husband? Why not?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.With regard to why Islam does not allow a woman to marry more than one man, the imams (may Allah have mercy on them) have explained the wisdom of the Lord behind that. For example, Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
That is the wisdom of the Lord and His kindness and mercy towards His slaves and His taking care of their affairs. Exalted be He far above anything other than that. His laws are above suggesting anything other than that. If it were permitted for a woman to have two husbands or more, the world would be corrupted, lineages would be lost, the husbands would kill one another, there would be great misery and tribulation, and there would be continuous trouble. 
How could a woman be in a good position if she were shared by a number of men who were fighting all the time? How could the men who share her be in a good situation?  
The fact that sharee’ah brings the teachings it does is one of the greatest signs of the wisdom of the Lawgiver and His mercy and care. 
If it is said, how come men are taken care of and given free rein to satisfy their desires and move from one wife to another according to their desires and needs, when a woman’s sex drive is the same as a man’s? 
The answer is that because women are usually hidden behind veils and inside their houses, and women tend to be more even-tempered than men, and less active than men, and men have been given more physical strength and energy which makes men’s desires greater than woman’s and men are affected by these desires more than women,  a man is allowed to marry more partners than a woman is. This is one of the things that have been given exclusively to men and not to women, one of the things in which they have been given something more than women, just as they are also favoured over women in that only men can be Messengers, Prophets, caliphs, kings, governors and judges, and go out for jihad, etc., and men have been made qawwaamoon (protectors and maintainers) of women, taking care of them, working to provide them with the means of living, exposing themselves to danger, travelling about in the land and exposing themselves to all sorts of trials in order to take care of their wives. 
The Lord is Ever-Appreciative and Forbearing, so He appreciates the men's efforts and has rewarded them by giving them something that He has not given to the women.  
If you compare the exhaustive efforts and hard work that men do for the sake of woman with the jealousy that women suffer, you will find that the men's share of effort and exhaustion is greater than the women’s share of having to put up with jealousy. 
This is the perfect justice, wisdom and mercy of Allah, may He be praised as He deserves.

It was narrated that ‘Aasim ibn ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab said: “I accompanied Ibn ‘Umar on the way to Makkah. He led us in praying two rak’ahs of Zuhr prayer, then he left and we left with him until he came to where his luggage was. He sat down and we sat with him, then he looked towards the place where we had prayed, and he saw some people standing and he asked, ‘What are these people doing?’ I said, ‘They are praying voluntary prayers.’ He said, ‘If I wanted to pray (naafil or Sunnah prayers) after the fard prayer I would have completed my prayer (i.e., not shortened it).’ O son of my brother, I accompanied the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) whilst travelling and he did not add anything to these two rak’ahs until Allah took him (in death); and I accompanied Abu Bakr and he did not add anything to these two rak’ahs until Allah took him (in death); and I accompanied ‘Umar and he did not add anything to these two rak’ahs until Allah took him (in death); and I accompanied ‘Uthmaan and he did not add anything to these two rak’ahs until Allah took him (in death). And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow’ [al-Ahzaab 33:21].” 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This demonstrates his understanding, may Allah be pleased with him. For Allah has reduced the four-rak’ah prayers for the traveller by half. If it were prescribed to pray the two rak’ahs (of Sunnah prayer) before and after, it would be more appropriate to pray the fard prayer in full.
Zaad al-Ma’aad, 1/316 
Another factor which indicates that it is prescribed to omit the regular Sunnah prayers whilst travelling is the saheeh report from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) combined Maghrib and ‘Isha prayer in Jam’ (i.e., Muzdalifah), reciting the iqaamah for each of them, and he did not pray Sunnah in between or after either of them.”

Then he told Bilaal to give the adhaan (call to prayer) then the iqaamah, then he prayed Zuhr, and then Bilaal recited another iqaamah and he prayed ‘Asr, and he did not pray anything in between.” 
Narrated by Muslim, 1218. 
But an exception is made from the above in the case of the regular Sunnah prayer of Fajr, which is to be performed when travelling just as it is performed when one is not travelling. Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
“It was the practice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when travelling to pray only the obligatory prayers, and it was not narrated that he used to pray the regular Sunnah prayers either before or after the fard prayers, apart from Witr and the Sunnah of Fajr, which he never omitted whether he was travelling or not.” 
Zaad al-Ma’aad, 1/473 
And he said: 
“His adherence to praying the Sunnah of Fajr was stronger than with all other naafil prayers, so he did not omit it or Witr whether he was travelling or not. When he was travelling he would still pray the Sunnah of Fajr and Witr and adhere to that more than all other naafil prayers. It is not narrated that he prayed any other regular Sunnah prayer when he was travelling.” 
Zaad al-Ma’aad, 1/315 
It was narrated that Abu Qutaadah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was on a journey and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stopped to rest and I stopped with him. He said, ‘Look!’ I said, ‘Here is one rider, two riders, three…’ until there were seven of us. He said, ‘Make sure that we do not miss our prayer’ – meaning Fajr prayer. But they slept deeply and nothing woke them but the heat of the sun. Then they got up and traveled on for a while, then they stopped and did wudoo’, and Bilaal gave the adhaan and they prayed two rak’ahs of Fajr then they prayed Fajr, then they rode on. They said to one another, ‘We have been negligent concerning our prayer.’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘There is no negligence in sleep, rather negligence comes when one is awake. If one of you forgets his prayer, let him pray when he remembers.’” 
Narrated by Muslim, 681 
In the chapter called Kitaab Salaat al-Musaafireen wa qasriha (The prayer of travelers and shortening the prayer) (no. 724), Imam Muslim narrates from ‘Aa’ishah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was not more keen to pray any naafil prayers regularly than the two rak’ahs before Fajr. 
Similarly it is prescribed for the traveller to continue to pray Witr, qiyaam al-layl (naafil prayers at night), Duha prayer and all prayers done for a reason such as praying after each wudoo’, salaat al-tawbah (prayer of repentance), tahiyyat al-masjid (greeting the mosque), two rak’ahs following Tawaaf, etc. Similarly, it is not forbidden to pray naafil at all. 
This is indicated by the following ahaadeeth: 
1 – It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: My dear friend [the Prophet] (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined three things upon me which I will not give up whether I am travelling or not: two rak’ahs of Duha prayer, fasting three days of each month and not going to sleep until I have prayed Witr.” 
Saheeh Sunan Abi Dawood, 1269. 
2 – It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray qiyaam al-layl atop his camel when he was travelling, no matter what direction it was facing, gesturing to represent the movements of the prayer, apart from the obligatory prayers, and he would pray Witr atop his camel. 
Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1000. 
According to another report: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray naafil prayers atop his camel, no matter what direction it was facing, and he would pray Witr like that too, but he did not pray the prescribed prayers like that. 
Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1098. 
3 – It was narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray atop his camel, no matter what direction it was facing, but when he wanted to pray an obligatory prayer, he would dismount and face the qiblah. 
Narrated by al-Bukhari, 400. 
4 – It was narrated from al-Nadr the freed slave of ‘Umar ibn ‘Ubayd-Allah that Abu Murrah the freed slave of Umm Haani’ bint Abi Taalib told him that he heard Umm Haani’ bint Abi Taalib say, “I went to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) during the year of the Conquest [of Makkah] and I found him doing ghusl and his daughter Faatimah was screening him. So I greeted him with salaam and he said, ‘Who is that?’ I said, ‘Umm Haani’ bint Abi Taalib.’ He said, ‘Welcome, Umm Haani’.’ When he had finished doing ghusl he stood up and prayed eight rak’ahs, wearing a single garment wrapped around his body. When he finished, I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, my brother said that he is going to kill a man to whom I have given protection, So and so the son of Hubayrah.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘We will give protection to the person to whom you have given protection, O Umm Haani,’’ and that was at the time of Duha (forenoon).” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 357 
The point is that it is prescribed to omit the regular Sunnah prayers for those who are travelling, and to limit it to the two Sunnah rak’ahs of Fajr. It is also prescribed for the traveller to continue to pray Salaat al-Witr, qiyaam al-layl, Duha and prayers done for specific reasons, and naafil prayers in general. From this you may understand that what some people say, that part of the Sunnah whilst travelling is not to pray Sunnah, is wrong. Apart from the fact that this does not make sense, it also goes against the saheeh Sunnah narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The correct view is that not praying Sunnah whilst travelling refers to the regular Sunnah prayers that are done before and after Zuhr, and after Maghrib and ‘Isha’.

    The Sunnah is for a person not to repeat ‘Umrah during the one trip, rather it is sufficient to perform the ritual once, because that is what the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did. With regard to the person on whose behalf you want to do ‘Umrah, it is better to 
    pray for him. That is the best thing to do in this case.",Shaykh Khaalid al-Mushayqih
21498,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21498,Prayer in congregation is obligatory for both travellers and non-travellers,"We are a group of men working far away from our homes and families, in a place where there are no people living, and no buildings or mosques. The time we spend at work is equal to the time we spend in our homes, i.e., we work for 28 days in return for 28 days off. This continues all year round, and we work for 12 hours each day.

What about praying in congregation (jamaa’ah) in this place? Is it obligatory or not?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Prayer in congregation is obligatory for non-travellers and 
    travellers like. 

    We have already mentioned the evidence for it being 
    obligatory in the answer to questions no 
    120 and 
    8918. 

    You have to establish prayer in congregation; one of you 
    should give the adhaan (call to prayer) then you should pray in 
    congregation. 

    Al-Bukhaari (628) narrated that Maalik ibn al-Huwayrith (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him) said: I came to the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) with a group of my people and we stayed 
    with him for twenty days. He was compassionate and kind, and when he saw 
    that we were missing our families he said: “Go back and stay with them and 
    teach them; pray as you have seen me praying. When the time for prayer 
    comes, let one of you give the call to prayer and let the oldest of you lead 
    (the others) in prayer.” 

    Abu Dawood (547) narrated that Abu’l-Darda’ (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “There are no three people in a 
    village or a desert among whom the prayer is not established, but the 
    Shaytaan will overwhelm them. You must adhere to the jamaa’ah, for the wolf 
    eats the sheep that strays off on its own.” Al-Saa’ib (one of the narrators 
    of the hadeeth) said: What is meant by jamaa’ah here is prayer in 
    congregation. It was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was 
    asked about a group of travellers who were going to attend a conference; 
    should they pray in the mosques or not? He replied: 

    The basic principle is that you should attend prayers in 
    congregation in the mosque with the people if you are in a place where you 
    can hear the adhaan without a loudspeaker because you are near the mosque. 
    If you are in a far place where you cannot hear the call to prayer even with 
    a loudspeaker, then pray in congregation where you are. Similarly if going 
    to the mosque will detract from the purpose for which you came then pray in 
    congregation where you are.
