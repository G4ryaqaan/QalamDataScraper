This is the view of Abu Hanifah, Ahmad and Dawud (may Allah have mercy on them).",,"Praise be to Allah.Al-Nawawi said: 
“According to the scholars, the vermin of the earth such as snakes , scorpions , dung beetles, cockroaches, rats etc., are haram. This is the view of Abu Hanifah, Ahmad and Dawud. 
Al-Shafi`’i and his companions quote as evidence for that the verse which reads, 
“and prohibits them as unlawful Al-Khabaith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods),” [al-A’raf 7:157 – interpretation of the meaning]
These are things which the Arabs find repulsive. And they quote as evidence the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “(There are) five animals, all of which are evil and should be killed in the Haram (sanctuary of Makkah): crows, kites [a kind of bird], scorpions, rats and vicious dogs .” (Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim from the report of `Aishah, Hafsah and Ibn ‘Umar). 
Umm Shurayk narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded the killing of lizards. (Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim). With regard to the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘I find not in that which has been revealed to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it be Maytah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth (by slaughtering or the like), or the flesh of swine (pork); for that surely, is impure or impious (unlawful) meat (of an animal) which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah (or has been slaughtered for idols, or on which Allah’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering).” [al-An’am 6:145], al-Shafi`i and other scholars said: what this refers to is things which you used to eat and regard as good. Al-Shafi`i said: “this is the most likely meaning of the verse, based on the Sunnah.

21902,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21902,Guidelines on shar’i wird,Is reading some sorts of daroods like darood-taj and darood_lakhi and darood_tunajaiyna etc bidaa`t.,,,"Praise be to Allah.We know nothing about what is in these wirds (daroods), but we can tell you some guidelines that you can follow in order to know what is prescribed in Islam and what is bid’ah: 
1 – The best wirds are those whose words were narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because Allaah did not choose for him anything but the most perfect and the best, and he did not choose anything but that for his ummah. 
2 – It is permissible for a person to send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in words that were not narrated (in sharee’ah), so long as they do not include anything that is forbidden, such as exaggerating about him, or praying to Allaah by virtue of the Prophet, or calling upon him instead of Allaah. 
3 – The one who is remembering Allaah (reciting dhikr) should not specify any particular time, number or manner of reciting dhikr unless that is proven with saheeh evidence, because Allaah cannot be worshipped except in the manner that He has prescribed in His Book or on the lips of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Worship must be that which is prescribed in sharee’ah, with regard to the act itself, the manner in which it is done, the time when it is done and how many times it is done. Whoever adopts a wird whose wording was not narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or specifies a particular number of times or does it at a specific time, is committing bid’ah. 
The scholars called this bid’ah al-bid’ah al-idaafiyyah (additional innovation??), because the action itself is prescribed in sharee’ah, but some innovation has been added to it with regard to the manner, the number of times or when it is to be done. 
You should note that all goodness rests in following that which has been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Whoever studies those who recite made-up wirds will find that usually they are falling short when it comes to doing that which was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) such as the dhikrs for morning and evening, etc. This confirms what was narrated from one of the salaf, who said that no person ever introduces an innovation but he gives up an equivalent Sunnah.

please clearify this thing to me that weather it is a kabirah sin or is it allowed in islam to do these things?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The action which you describe is an innovation (bid’ah), as 
    you indicated in your question, because there is no doubt that the people 
    who are doing this are doing it as an act of worship by which they seek to 
    draw closer to Allaah, and every action which is done as an act of worship 
    must have evidence from the Qur’aan or Sunnah to show that it is prescribed, 
    otherwise it is an innovation. 

    With regard to those who ask, how can reciting Soorat al-Faatihah 
    be wrong? 

    It should be noted that innovations in religion are of two 
    types: 

    1 – New innovations which have no basis in sharee’ah, such as 
    those who invent a new prayer in a manner that has not been narrated in 
    sharee’ah. This is an innovation for which Allaah threatens the one who does 
    it with Hell. 

    2 – Innovations where something new is added to an action 
    that has a basis in sharee’ah. For example, there are adhkaar (dhikr) which 
    are prescribed following the prescribed prayers, which are well known, and 
    no Muslim disagrees with this. But if a group of people comes along and says 
    that so long as dhikr is prescribed following the prayer then we will 
    remember Allaah together and recite dhikr in unison, this is bid’ah. We say 
    to them, either you think that this way of reciting dhikr is better than the 
    way of the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and 
    therefore that you are following a way that is more guided and better than 
    his  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) – which no Muslim would 
    say who testifies that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah – or this is 
    wrong and is an innovation, so they should give it up. 

    Hence it is clear that regarding this matter as bid’ah does 
    not mean at all that reciting al-Faatihah is wrong, rather what is wrong is 
    reciting it in the manner mentioned in the question. We do not love the 
    Sahaabah any more than those who came after them (the Taabi’een), and the 
    Sahaabah were the people who had the greatest love for Allaah and His 
    Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and it is not 
    narrated that they did that for their Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) when he died. All goodness is to be found in following 
    them and their way, and all evil is to be found in going against them and 
    shunning their way. Moreover, the fact that these people single out ‘Ali and 
    do this on the occasion of his death implies that they are exaggerating 
    about him. This may be one of the blameworthy innovations of Shi’ism, which 
    is to be avoided altogether. 

    May Allaah make us and you steadfast in adhering to the 
    Sunnah and avoiding bid’ah. Ameen.

21904,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21904,How the Shaytaan has a share in people’s wealth,"What is the share that the Shaytaan has in people’s wealth, as mentioned in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“share with them wealth and children (by tempting them to earn money by illegal ways usury, or by committing illegal sexual intercourse),”[al-Israa’ 17:64]?",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          The share that he has in their wealth is when they spend 
          it in disobeying Allaah. This was the view of al-Hasan. And it was said 
          that it is that which is acquired from sources which are not halaal. 
          This was the view of Mujaahid. 
 
          Ibn ‘Abbaas said: (it means) the things they used to 
          forbid such as al-baheerah (a she-camel whose milk was spared 
          for the idols and nobody was allowed to milk it), al-saa’ibah 
          (a she-camel let loose for free pasture for their false gods, and nothing 
          was allowed to be carried on it), al-waseelah (a she-camel set 
          free for idols because it had given birth to a she-camel at its first 
          delivery and then again gave birth to a she-camel at its second delivery) 
          and al-haam (a stallion-camel freed freed from work for their 
          idols after it had finished a number of copulations assigned for it). 
          This was the view of Qutaadah. Al-Dahhaak said: (it means) what they 
          used to sacrifice to their gods. 
 
          It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas and Mujaahid: this is 
          what he (the Shaytaan) commands them to do of spending their wealth 
          in disobeying Allaah. ‘Ataa’ said: this means riba (usury, interest). 
          Al-Hasan said: this means acquiring it (wealth) from evil sources and 
          spending it in haraam ways. This was also the view of Qutaadah. Al-‘Awfi 
          said, narrating from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both): 
          with regard to his sharing in their wealth, this means that which he 
          forbade them of their an’aam (livestock such as camels, cattle, 
          etc.), i.e., the baheerah,  saa’ibah, etc. This was also 
          the view of al-Dahhaak and Qutaadah. 
 
          Al-Tabari said:
 
          The view which is most likely to be correct is the view 
          of those who said that what this meant was every kind of wealth which 
          involved disobeying Allaah, whether it was spent on haraam things, earned 
          from haraam sources, sacrificed to their gods, instituted as a saa’ibah 
          or  baheerah for the Shaytaan, or other ways by means of which 
          it was spent in disobedience (towards Allaah). That is because Allaah 
          said (interpretation of the meaning): “share with them wealth”. 
          So every kind of wealth by means of which the Shaytaan is obeyed and 
          Allaah is disobeyed, the one who does that has given Iblees a share 
          in it; there is no reason why one specific meaning should be intended 
          to the exclusion of others (i.e., the meaning is general). 
 
          With regard to the Shaytaan sharing in food and drink 
          – to which his sharing in staying overnight in people’s houses, which 
          are also a form of wealth, is also added – in the case of those who 
          do not mention the name of Allaah, this is mentioned in the hadeeth 
          of Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah, who said that he heard the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “When a man enters 
          his house and remembers Allaah [i.e., says Bismillaah] when he enters 
          and when he eats, the Shaytaan says, ‘You have no place to stay and 
          no dinner.’ If he enters and does not remember Allaah when entering, 
          the Shaytaan says, ‘You have found a place to stay.’ If he does not 
          remember Allaah when he eats, [the Shaytaan] says, ‘You have found a 
          place to stay and dinner.’”
 
          (Narrated by Muslim, 2018). 
 
          It was narrated that Hudhayfah said: When we ate with 
          the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), we would not stretch forth 
          our hands until the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stretched forth his hand 
          first. We were going to eat with him one time, when a young girl came 
          rushing as if she were being pushed. She went to stretch forth her hand 
          to the food, but the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) took hold of her hand. Then 
          a Bedouin came rushing as if he were being pushed, and he took hold 
          of his hand. Then the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Shaytaan regards 
          food as permissible (for himself) if the name of Allaah is not mentioned 
          over it. He brought this girl so that the food might become permissible 
          for him through her, but I took her hand. Then he brought this Bedouin 
          so that the food might become permissible for him through him, but I 
          took his hand. By the One in Whose hand is my soul, his hand is in mine 
          along with her hand.” This was narrated by Muslim, 2017. 
 
          Al-Nawawi said: 
 The 
          correct view, which is that of the majority of scholars of the earlier 
          and later generations, scholars of hadeeth, fiqh and kalaam, is that 
          this hadeeth and similar ahaadeeth which were narrated concerning the 
          Shaytaan eating are to be interpreted according to their apparent meaning. 
          The Shaytaan eats in a real sense, because rationally this is not impossible 
          and sharee’ah does not deny it, rather it confirms it. So we must accept 
          it and believe in it. And Allaah knows best.

What are the signs of Laylat  al-Qadr? 


When is Laylat al-Qadr?","Praise be to Allah.Can we see Laylat al-Qadr?
Laylat al-Qadr may be seen with the eye, for the one whom Allah helps to see it. That is by seeing its signs. The Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) used to recognize it by its signs. But not seeing them does not mean that one will not gain its reward, if one spends that night in prayer out of faith and the hope of reward. 
The Muslim should strive to seek it in the last ten nights of Ramadan, as enjoined by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), hoping to earn reward. 
If it so happens that a person spends this night in prayer out of faith and seeking reward, then he will gain its reward, even if he does not know that that was Laylat al-Qadr. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever spends the night of Laylat al-Qadr in prayer out of faith and seeking reward, all his previous sins will be forgiven.”
According to another report: “Whoever spends that night in prayer, seeking Laylat al-Qadr, then he catches it, his previous and future sins will be forgiven.” 
What are the signs of Laylat  al-Qadr? 
And a sound report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) indicates that the sign of Laylat al-Qadr is that the sun rises on the following morning with no visible rays. 
Ubayy ibn Ka’b used to swear that it was the night of the twenty-seventh, citing this sign as evidence. 
When is Laylat al-Qadr? 
The more correct view is that Laylat al-Qadr moves through all the last ten nights, but it is most likely to be one of the odd-numbered nights, and the night of the twenty-seventh is the most likely among the odd-numbered nights. 
Whoever strives in worship during all of the last ten nights, praying, reading Quran, making du’a and other kinds of good deeds will undoubtedly catch up with Laylat al-Qadr and attain what Allah has promised to those who do that out of faith and seeking reward.

The Muslim has to fear Allaah and remember that He is always watching; he should prefer the Hereafter to this life. If he finds someone who will lend him the money then all well and good.  If he cannot find anyone who will do that then he could borrow from a Muslim, taking a loan with no interest involved.

This is the view of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him).
Muslim (3024) narrated that ‘Ubayd-Allah ibn ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Utbah said: “Ibn `Abbas said to me, ‘Do you know the last Surah of the Quran that was revealed in full?’ I said, ‘Yes, “When there comes the Help of Allah (to you, O Muhammad against your enemies) and the Conquest (of Makkah)” [al-Nasr 110:1 – interpretation of the meaning]].’ He said, ‘You have spoken the truth.’” 
This is supported by the sahih report from ‘Umar and Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) that this Surah was a sign that the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was approaching. 
Al-Bukhari (4970) narrated that Ibn `Abbas said: “‘'Umar used to make me sit with the elderly men who had fought in the Battle of Badr. Some of them felt it (did not like that) and said to 'Umar ‘Why do you bring in this boy to sit with us when we have sons like him?’ 'Umar said, ‘Because of what you know of his position (i.e. his religious knowledge.)’ One day 'Umar called me and made me sit in the gathering of those people; and I think that he called me just to show them (my religious knowledge). 'Umar then asked them (in my presence). ‘What do you say about the interpretation of the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“When there comes the Help of Allah (to you, O Muhammad against your enemies) and the Conquest (of Makkah).” [Al-Nasr 110:1]?’

On that, 'Umar asked me, ‘Do you say the same, O Ibn 'Abbas?’ I said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘What do you say then?’ I said, ‘That is the sign of the death of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which Allah informed him of.

Al-Bara ibn ‘Azib (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the last Surah to be revealed was Bara-ah (al-Tawbah).

Do I have the right to sit on the floor or should I follow the housefolk?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It was narrated that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) never ate at a table. In Saheeh al-Bukhaari 
    (6450) it was narrated that Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) never ate at a 
    table (khiwaan) until he died and he never ate soft bread until he 
    died.”  

    It says in ‘Awn al-Ma’bood: “The khiwaan is a table 
    made of wood with legs on each side; eating from such a table is the habit 
    of those who live a life of luxury, so that they do not have to bend over 
    and tilt their heads when eating.”

     There is no doubt that it is permissible to eat at a 
    khiwaan or at a high table, and to eat soft bread. But the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) refrained from those things out 
    of humility and as a sign of his giving up the pleasures of this world.

     Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: “The fact that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) refrained from eating at tables 
    and eating soft bread meant that he was giving up the pleasures of this 
    world in return for the pleasures of the abiding world (of the Hereafter).”

     This does not justify denouncing those who do things like 
    that. If a person visits people and finds them eating at a table, there is 
    nothing wrong with him eating with them at the table. They would find it 
    very strange indeed if he were to go away and sit on the floor on his own; 
    he should not make them do that, rather he should accept their invitation 
    and eat with them. If he explains to them what the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, and reminds them of asceticism

    my ummah may be forgiven except for those who commit sin openly.” (Narrated 
    by al-Bukhaari, no. 60696). This is a great sin, and we ask Allaah to save 
    us from it. 

    If a person sits with people who sin, either of the following 
    two scenarios must apply: 

    Either he sits with him at the time when that person is 
    committing the sin. 

    In this case it is not permissible for him to sit with him so 
    long as he is still sinning, unless he is able to put a stop to it by 
    advising him or in some other way. If the evil action is stopped then it is 
    permissible for him to sit with him. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “And it has already been revealed to you in the Book (this 
    Qur’aan) that when you hear the Verses of Allaah being denied and mocked at, 
    then sit not with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if 
    you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them” [al-Nisa’ 
    4:140]

    But if the person does not stop committing the sin, then he 
    must leave the gathering, but it is better to explain to (the sinner) the 
    reason for leaving, if that will have an effect on him and prompt him to 
    give up the evil action. 

    The second scenario is when the person is not committing sin 
    at that moment, in which case it is permissible to sit with him and there is 
    no sin in that.

     2 – You ask whether you should stop being friends with them, 
    or not.

     The answer is: 

     If the sister is confident that she will not be led astray 
    because of them and she thinks that some good can come of being friends with 
    them, in the sense that she can continue to advise them and tell them what 
    is good for them, then in that case continuing to be friends with them is 
    better. We ask Allaah to give her strength and support.

     But if she thinks that they may have an influence on her if 
    she mixes with them a lot and gets used to what they are doing, then she 
    should not sit with them and she should give up her friendship with them, in 
    order to protect her religious commitment, especially if she has already 
    advised them several times and they have not responded.

     Then if she thinks that she can look for others whom she can 
    try to advise, she will be rewarded for that.

21922,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21922,What is the ruling on taking pictures surreptitiously and transmitting them?,"What is the ruling on taking pictures surreptitiously, especially pictures of women, and transmitting them via mobile phones or via the internet, and the poor women do not know about that?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Doing this is undoubtedly haraam, and it involves several 
    things that are forbidden according to sharee’ah, including the following: 

    1 – Transgressing the limits set by Allaah. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whosoever 
    transgresses the set limits of Allaah, then indeed he has wronged himself”

    [al-Talaaq 65:1]

    2 – Looking at ‘awrahs which it is forbidden to look at. The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do not 
    follow one glance with another, for the first is allowable but not the 
    second.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in 
    Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
3 – Transgressing 
    against the sanctity of another Muslim. The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Every Muslim is sacred to his fellow 
    Muslim – his blood, his wealth and his honour.” 

    4 – If the one who takes the picture took it for a reason and 
    is one who is allowed to see her ‘awrah, such as a female doctor or a 
    friend, etc, then her taking and transmitting her picture is a betrayal of 
    trust, and there are many well-known texts which condemn betrayal. The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The one who 
    is not trustworthy is not a believer, and the one who does not keep his 
    promises is not religiously-committed.” Narrated by Ahmad and classed as 
    saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 7179. 

    5 – This action causes harm and annoyance to believing women, 
    and Allaah has issued a warning to those who harm and annoy believing men 
    and women for no offence on their part, as He says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“And those who annoy 
    believing men and women undeservedly, they bear (on themselves) the crime of 
    slander and plain sin”

    [al-Ahzaab 33:58]

    The words translated here as “undeservedly” mean: without 
    them having committed a crime for which they deserve to be annoyed, i.e., 
    punished. The phrase “they bear (on themselves) the crime of slander” 
    means, for annoying them for no reason; “plain sin” refers to their 
    aggression against them and their transgression of the sacred command of 
    Allaah. 

    See Tafseer al-Sa’di, p. 1120 

    The crime is more serious if that involves annoying or 
    harming a neighbour. 
Muslim (64) narrated 
    from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No one from 
    whose harm his neighbour is not safe will enter Paradise.” 

    “Harm” here means wrongdoing, deceit and annoyance. 

    6 – This is similar to the action of the hypocrites who used 
    to harrass the believing women. Allaah issued a stern warning to them when 
    He said (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “If the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease 
    (evil desire for illegal sex), and those who spread false news among the 
    people in Al‑Madeenah stop not, We shall certainly let you overpower them, 
    then they will not be able to stay in it as your neighbours but a little 
    while.
61. Accursed, they shall 
    be seized wherever found, and killed with a (terrible) slaughter”
[al-Ahzaab 33:60-61]

    “We shall certainly let you overpower them” means: We 
    will command you to punish them and fight them, and We will give you power 
    over them. 
The verse does not 
    mention the action that they are supposed to stop doing, rather it includes 
    every evil action that occurred to them, such as insulting Islam and its 
    followers, spreading false rumours about the Muslims, seeking to sow discord 
    among them, accusing the believing women of bad and immoral actions, and 
    other sins committed by such people. 

    See Tafseer al-Sa’di, p. 1121 

    7 – It goes against the Islamic command to seek permission 
    before entering people’s houses. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “O you who believe! Enter not houses other than your own, 
    until you have asked permission and greeted those in them; that is better 
    for you, in order that you may remember.

    28. And if you find no one therein, still, enter not until 
    permission has been given. And if you are asked to go back, go back, for it 
    is purer for you. And Allaah is All‑Knower of what you do”

    [al-Noor 24:27]

    Imam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    “Chapter: Seeking permission to enter has been ordained 
    because of the gaze”  

    al-Haafiz said: 

    i.e., it was prescribed because of that, because if a person 
    enters without permission he may see something that the person whose house 
    it is does not want him to see. A clear example of that appears in the 
    report narrated by al-Bukhaari in al-Adab al-Mufrad, and by Abu 
    Dawood and al-Tirmidhi, and classed as hasan by the latter, from Thawbaan 
    and attributed to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him): “It is not permissible for a Muslim to look inside a house until he 
    has asked permission; once he has done that, he has entered.” Classed as 
    saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Adab al-Mufrad.  So once he has 
    been given permission, then it is as if he has already entered, i.e., he 
    comes under the same ruling as someone who is already inside the house. 

    Moreover al-Bukhaari (6241) and Muslim narrated that Sahl ibn 
    Sa’d (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “A man looked through a hole at 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had a stick with 
    which he was scratching his head. He said: “If I had known that you were 
    watching, I would have stabbed you in the eye with it. Seeking permission 
    has been ordained because of the gaze.” 

    Al-Nawawi said: “A stick [midra] with which he was scratching 
    his head”: a midra is a piece of iron that is used to tidy the hair of the 
    head. And it was said that it is like a comb. 

    “Permission has been ordained because of the gaze” – what 
    this means is that seeking permission is prescribed and enjoined in 
    sharee’ah, and it has been ordained lest the gaze fall upon something 
    haraam. So it is not permissible for anyone to look through a door or 
    anything else through which his gaze may fall upon a non-mahram women. And 
    Allaah knows best. 

    Al-Bukhaari (6242) and Muslim narrated from Anas ibn Maalik 
    that a man peeped into one of the apartments of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) stood up with an arrowhead and it is as if I can see 
    him now, trying to poke him (whilst the man was not aware). 

    This hadeeth indicates that it is permissible to punish the 
    one who looks into a house without the permission of the owner by throwing 
    something at him, even if it puts out his eye.  

    Muslim (2158) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever looks into a 
    house without the people’s permission, it is permissible for them to put out 
    his eye.” 

    Al-Nawawi said: 

    With regard to the words of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him):  “Whoever looks into a house without the 
    people’s permission, it is permissible for them to put out his eye,” the 
    scholars said that this is to be understood as referring to a case where 
    someone  looks into a man’s house and he throws a stone at him and it puts 
    out his eye. Is it permissible to throw something without warning him? There 
    are two points of view among our companions, the more correct of which is 
    that it is permissible, because of the apparent meaning of this hadeeth. And 
    Allaah knows best. 

    8 – This action causes corruption in society and spreads 
    immorality and evil. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, those who like 
    that (the crime of) illegal sexual intercourse should be propagated among 
    those who believe, they will have a painful torment in this world and in the 
    Hereafter. And Allaah knows and you know not”

    [al-Noor 24:19]

    If this stern warning is addressed to one who likes in his 
    heart that immorality should spread and prevail, then how about one who 
    actually causes it to spread? Undoubtedly his punishment will be more severe 
    and his sin will be greater. 

    9 – Keeping the picture is persisting in sin and 
    transgressing the sacred limits set by Allaah, and it keeps the one who does 
    it further away from repentance. Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) said: “There is no minor sin if one persists in it (i.e., it becomes a 
    major sin).” 

    10 – Transmitting the picture further compounds the sin of 
    the one who committed it, and takes him further away from the mercy and 
    forgiveness of Allaah. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “All of my ummah will be forgiven except those who commit 
    sin openly. It is part of committing sin openly if a man does something at 
    night and Allaah conceals him, but in the morning he says, ‘O So and so, I 
    did such and such last night.’ His Lord had concealed him all night long, 
    but in the morning he disclosed what Allaah had concealed.” Agreed upon.

She also had two other brothers who died during her lifetime, one of whom was a full-brother and the other was a half-brother through her father, and they had children. How should the inheritance be divided?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    If there is a full brother or a half brother through the 
    father, then the siblings’ children do not inherit. 

    Based on this, then the children of the brothers, in this 
    case, do not inherit anything. 

    Secondly: 
If there is a full 
    brother, then the half-siblings through the father do not inherit anything, 
    whether they are male or female. There is scholarly consensus on all these 
    points. 

    See al-Mughni, 9/22, 23 

    Based on this, the estate in this case should be divided 
    among the full-brother and the full-sister, with the male getting twice the 
    share of the female. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They ask you for a 
    legal verdict. Say: Allaah directs (thus) about Al‑Kalaalah (those who leave 
    neither descendants nor ascendants as heirs). If it is a man that dies 
    leaving a sister, but no child, she shall have half the inheritance. If 
    (such a deceased was) a woman, who left no child, her brother takes her 
    inheritance. If there are two sisters, they shall have two-thirds of the 
    inheritance; if there are brothers and sisters, the male will have twice the 
    share of the female. (Thus) does Allaah make clear to you (His Law) lest you

    because of the hadeeth narrated by Abu Dawood (1481) and al-Tirmidhi (3477) 
    from Faddaalah ibn ‘Ubayd (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: “The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) heard a 
    man making du’aa’ in his prayer without glorifying Allaah or sending 
    blessings upon the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
    The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said, ‘This man is in a hurry.’ He called him and said to him or to someone 
    else, ‘When anyone of you makes du’aa’, let him start by glorifying his Lord 
    and praising Him, then let him send blessings upon the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then let him pray for whatever he 
    wants.’” (This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi 
    Dawood, 1314). 

    Al-Bayhaqi narrated in Shu’ab al-Eemaan that ‘Ali (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him) said: “Every du’aa’ is not responded to until 
    one sends blessings upon the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him).” This was narrated by Baqiy ibn Mukhallid from ‘Ali in a marfoo’ 
    report, i.e., it was attributed to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him). (This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in 
    Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 4523) 

    ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “Du’aa’ is 
    detained between the heavens and the earth and no part of it is taken up 
    until you send blessings upon your Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him).” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 486; classed as hasan by 
    al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 403). 

    Imaam al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in

    start one’s du’aa’ by praising Allaah, then sending blessings upon the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and to 
    end the du’aa’ in the same manner. There are many marfoo’ reports on this 
    subject (i.e., reports which are attributed to the Prophet  (peace and

    Note that sending blessings on the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) take three forms:

     1 – Sending blessings upon him before making du’aa’, and 
    after praising Allaah, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of

    glorifying his Lord and praising Him, then let him send blessings upon the

     2 – Sending blessings upon him at the beginning of the 
    du’aa’, in the middle and at the end.

     3 – Sending blessings upon him at the beginning and at the

    Protecting oneself and one’s honour, mind, wealth and 
    religion is a well-established basic principle in Islam.
    These are the five essentials which are well known to Muslims. A 
    person has to defend himself; it is not permissible for him to consume that 
    which will harm him, and it is not permissible for him to allow anyone to 
    harm him. If a person or a vicious animal etc attacks him, he has to defend 
    himself, or his family or his property, and if he is killed he is counted as 
    a shaheed (martyr), and the killer will be in Hell.  

    If the harm that will result from this aggression is little 
    and he gives up defending himself for the sake of Allah, then undoubtedly 
    Allah will compensate him for that, so long as this does not cause any

I hope that you can advise me. I cannot be apart from him and he does not.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Note – may Allaah bless you – that our great religion firmly warns us against forming relationships between the sexes outside the framework of marriage and firmly closes the door to the calamity of introduction programs that are propagated by means of newspapers, magazines and the internet. These warnings are a means of warding off fitnah (temptation and tribulation) and preventing love affairs which usually lead people to commit acts of grave immorality and transgression of the sacred limits set by Allaah – Allaah forbid – or they lead them to marriages that end in failure and are filled with suspicion and mistrust.
First of all, you made a mistake by entering the chat room before knowing what the Islamic ruling on that is. Then you made another mistake by forming a relationship and friendship with a young man who is not related to you.
Beware of making a third mistake by marrying him because he claims to love you sincerely and you are afraid that he may commit suicide! 
Marriage that is not based on a sound Islamic foundation is doomed to end in failure and regret. A young man who has spent all this time forming a relationship with a girl through chat rooms and telephone calls is in fact a young man who has no religious commitment, modesty or manners, and he cannot be entrusted with the honour of the Muslims. His threat to commit suicide means one of two things: 
Either he is sincere in his threat, which means that he is very weak in faith, because killing oneself is a major sin – may Allaah keep us safe and sound;
 Or he is lying, which means that he is a hateful opportunist and a fool, as well as a selfish individual who cares only for his own personal interests.  
If you were to marry this person, it would not take very long before suspicions arose which would lead to him losing trust in you and not having a peaceful or relaxed life with you. From his point of view, a girl whom he gets to know through talking on the phone or through chat rooms cannot be trusted not to form relationships with others. This will occupy his thoughts and make him anxious. 
Finally, you should note that this advice which we are offering to you is based on sincere concern for you. You should learn a lesson from the experience of other girls who have fallen victim to love relationships and lost their honour as a result. You should give up this young man immediately and repent to Allaah and ask His forgiveness, and praise Him for saving you from committing immoral actions even though the means that lead to them are easily available. You should also praise Him for putting obstacles in the way of this marriage, through your family’s refusal. Start a new life filled with purity and chastity, regret and prayers for forgiveness, keeping away from the things that lead to temptation and immorality. Do a lot of righteous deeds, read a great deal of Qur’aan, and attend many righteous gatherings. With time, your relationship with this person will fade, for it is based on emotions that are not based on shar’i guidelines or wise thinking. Beware lest the Shaytaan ensnare you and makes you think that you cannot forget or sever the relationship forever; these are just whispers and tricks, and devilish attempts to keep you in the hell of love and emotion, and distract you from the higher aims of sincere devotion and submission to Allaah and constant striving to please Him. We ask Allaah to give you a way out from your distress and anxiety.",Dr Riyaadh al-Musaymeeri

Since the internet, a new way of learning about Islam opened my eyes/heart. And I must say that I became a better Muslim since I surf your website and listen/read your lectures/articles etc.... So I would like to congratulate your team for the immense postive influence your site has on people (like me). As I'm extremely positive about the information on your site and the knowledge about Islam you provide, I would like to ask a question which is bothering me/my friend some time: Some time ago Dr Sakhar gave a lecture and talked about finding a job within 3 days if a Muslim knows how to proceed/behave... Unfortunately he did not mention the solutions/the way to handle. Please could you maybe help me how I can help a person finding a job through spiritual aide. If i may give you more background to the situation: Me and my friend know eachother through the net/phone since 1.5 year and we would like to make a life together. The problem is that he's abroad (Kuwait) and needs a workpermit if he wants to setle in my country (Belgium). He would like to come over to Belgium, find a job, settle over here, and if our contacts (but also with our families) are both positive we would like to live together (marriage). So since a few months, me and my friend, are surfing like crazy through the web to find him a job, put cv's online etc.. The difficulty is to find a job and an employer who would accept to make a workpermit for my friend (due to tough immigration law in Europe). We are intensively trying to find a solution since a few months but we still didnt succeed and we are both getting desperate, because we fear that not finding a job would be the answer that our destiny is not together. Please could you help us out how to come to peace with this situation as it is very stressy for both of us. Thank you so much in advance.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    We praise Allaah for blessing you with guidance and 
    righteousness. We ask Allaah to make us and you steadfast in doing and 
    saying that which pleases Him. 

    The believer turns to Allaah with regard to everything that 
    happens to him, he turns to Him for all his needs. For Allaah is the One Who 
    responds to the one in need when he calls upon Him and relieves his 
    suffering. Allaah has told us that He is near and responds to the prayer of 
    the one who calls upon Him. Du’aa’ is like a weapon in the hands of the 
    believer, which he should use properly. So call upon Allaah and be certain 
    that He will respond, and pursue the means of having your du’aa’ accepted, 
    and choose the times when du’aa’s are answered. You can refer to question 
    no. 5113 to learn 
    more about these means. 

    I would also like to point out a matter that is of the utmost 
    importance, which is that Muslims, men and women alike, should protect 
    themselves from the things that lead to forming an emotional attachment to 
    someone who is not a spouse. Of course a person may have no control over 
    love, [?] but he or she may do things that lead to an increase in emotional 
    attachment, such as conversations between a man and a woman that lead to 
    stirrings of emotions and desires. This is forbidden as a means of closing 
    the door and so that a person will not form an emotional attachment to a 
    person whom it is difficult to get married to, which will lead to hardship 
    for both parties and will distract the heart from its obligation to love 
    Allaah and obey Him. Please see Question no.

          It says in the hadeeth narrated by ‘Abd al-Razzaaq in 
          his  Musannaf from Layth from Taawoos that the Messenger of Allaah 
          SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “… there is no 
          travel by wandering ascetics, no hermitage and no monasticism in Islam.” 
          Al-Albaani said in Da’eef al-Jaami’, “(It is) da’eef.” (no. 6287)
 
          What is saheeh is that which was narrated by Abu Dawood 
          in his Sunan from the hadeeth of Abu Umaamah, that the Prophet 
          SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The siyaahah 
          (travel of wandering ascetics) of my ummah is jihaad for the sake of 
          Allaah.”
 
          (Classed as saheeh in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 2093)
 
          The word saa’ihaat (translated as “emigrants”) in the 
          aayah:
“Muslims (who submit 
          to Allaah), believers, obedient (to Allaah), turning to Allaah in repentance,

21944,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21944,Ruling on giving charity to one who follows some innovations (bid’ahs),Is it permissible to give charity and financial help to one who follows some innovations?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly helping a 
    Muslim, relieving his distress, meeting his needs and guarding him against 
    loss are all part of the befriending of one another that is a basic 
    requirement of faith, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The believers, men and 
    women, are Awliyaa’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one 
    another; they enjoin (on the people) Al‑Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and 
    all that Islam orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al‑Munkar (i.e. 
    polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); 
    they perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and give the Zakaah, and obey 
    Allaah and His Messenger. Allaah will have His Mercy on them. Surely, Allaah 
    is All-Mighty, All-Wise”

    [al-Tawbah 9:71]

    This is also indicated by the words of the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “The believer is the mirror of 
    his fellow believer, and the believer is the brother of his fellow believer. 
    He guards him against loss and protects him when he is absent.” Narrated by 
    Abu Dawood, 4918; classed as hasan by al-Albaani. 

    With regard to the words “he protects him against loss”, Ibn 
    al-Atheer said:  A man’s loss may be with regard to handicrafts, commerce, 
    agriculture etc., so his fellow believer supports him and tries to help him 
    to earn a living.  

    The words “and protects him when he is absent” mean he 
    protects him and defends him as much as he can. See ‘Awn al-Ma’bood. 
And the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The relationship between 
    one believer and another is like a structure, parts of which support other 
    parts,” and he interlaced his fingers. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 481; Muslim, 
    2585. 

    Al-Nawawi said: These words – “The relationship between one 
    believer and another is like a structure, part of which support other parts” 
    – clearly indicate the importance of the Muslims’ rights over one another, 
    and encourage them to show compassion, kindness and support to one another, 
    but not in sin or in anything bad. 

    There are many texts of the Qur’aan and saheeh Sunnah which 
    speak of such matters, all of them pointing towards befriending, supporting 
    and protecting on the basis of faith and Islam. That must be the basis for 
    loving and hating, giving and withholding, as the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever gives for the sake of Allaah 
    and withholds for the sake of Allaah, loves for the sake of Allaah and hates 
    for the sake of Allaah, and gets married for the sake of Allaah, has 
    perfected his faith.” Ahmad, 1519; al-Tirmidhi, 2521; Abu Dawood, 4681; 
    classed as hasan by al-Albaani. 
People vary with regard 
    to faith and Islam. Some of them fear Allaah and have faith more than 
    others. Thus each person varies in the degree to which he is entitled to the 
    rights of friendship, depending on the degree of his religious commitment, 
    although they all come under the general heading of the friendship that is 
    required in Islam. 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said in al-Fataawa, 28/209: 

    Allaah sent the Messengers and revealed the Books so that the 
    religion (worship) would all be for Allaah, so that love would be for His 
    close friends and hate for His enemies; so that His close friends would be 
    honoured and His enemies humiliated; so that the reward would be for His 
    close friends and the punishment would be for His enemies. If good and evil, 
    obedience and disobedience, Sunnah and bid’ah, coexist in a person, then he 
    is deserving of friendship and reward to the extent that he is good, and he 
    deserves enmity and punishment to the extent that he is bad. So the reasons 
    for honouring and humiliating may coexist in a person; both may coexist in 
    him – such as a poor thief whose hand is cut off for stealing, but he is 
    given enough from the bayt al-maal (treasury) to meet his needs. 

    This is the basic principle upon which Ahl al-Sunnah 
    wa’l-Jamaa’ah are agreed… 

    The answer to this question is based on this general 
    principle. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:  

    There is some bid’ah for which a person may be excused, there 
    is some which reaches the degree of fisq (evildoing) and there is some that 
    reaches the degree of kufr. With regard to those who follow bid’ah that 
    constitutes kufr, it is not permissible to help them at all, even if they 
    call themselves Muslims, because their calling themselves Muslims whilst 
    they persist in that bid’ah that constitutes kufr, even after evidence has 
    been established against them, means that they are akin to the hypocrites 
    who said, “we bear witness that you are the Messenger of Allaah,” but Allaah 
    said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allaah knows that you 
    are indeed His Messenger, and Allaah bears witness that the hypocrites are 
    liars indeed”

    [al-Munaafiqoon 63:1]

    With regard to innovation that constitutes fisq (evildoing), 
    or for which a person may have a justifiable excuse, the fact that they 
    follow bid’ah does not mean that we are not allowed to help them. They 
    should be helped against their kaafir enemies because they are undoubtedly 
    better than those kuffaar. Al-Baab al-Maftooh, 1/66 
But they should be 
    prevented from spending this money on establishing or propagating their 
    bid’ahs. If it is known or it is thought most likely that they will use that 
    money to support their bid’ahs, and they cannot be stopped from doing so, 
    and they will not spend it on permissible things that they need, then they 
    should not be given any of this money, because that entails helping them in 
    their sin. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

     “Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, 
    righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and 
    transgression. And fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe in punishment”

          With regard to the Shaytaan having a share when one does 
          not say Bismillaah, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “share with them wealth and children (by tempting 
          them to earn money by illegal ways   usury, 
          or by committing illegal sexual intercourse),”
 
          [al-Israa’ 17:64]
 
           Al-Qurtubi said: i.e., give yourself a share in 
          that… 
 
          “children”: it was said that this means the children 
          of zina (fornication, adultery). This was the view of Mujaahid, al-Dahhaak 
          and ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas. It was also narrated that he said, this 
          refers to the children whom they killed and against whom they committed 
          other crimes. It was also narrated that he said, this refers to when 
          they call them by names such as ‘Abd al-Haarith, ‘Abd al-‘Uzza, ‘Abd 
          al-Laat, ‘Abd al-Shams [i.e., names meaning “slave of…” referring to 
          their false gods]. And it was said that this refers to their initiating 
          their children into kufr so that they make them into Jews or Christians, 
          as the Christians do with their children when they baptize them with 
          water. This was the view of Qutaadah. 
 
          The fifth view was narrated from Mujaahid who said: If 
          a man has intercourse and does not mention the name of Allaah, the jinn 
          wraps himself around his penis and has intercourse along with him. This 
          is what is referred to in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “with whom no man or jinni has had Tamth [sexual intercourse] 
          before them”
 
          [al-Rahmaan 55:56]
 
          Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 10/289 
 
          Ibn Katheer said: 
 
          “ ‘share with them wealth and 
          children (by tempting them to earn money by illegal ways  
           usury, or by committing illegal sexual intercourse)’
 
          [al-Israa’ 17:64 – interpretation of the meaning]
 
          ‘children’: al-‘Awfi said, narrating from Ibn 
          ‘Abbaas, Mujaahid and al-Dahhaak: this means the children of zina. ‘Ali 
          ibn Abi Talhah said, narrating from Ibn ‘Abbaas: this refers to their 
          children whom they used to kill from folly, without knowledge. Qutaadah 
          said, narrating from al-Hasan al-Basri: by Allaah, he had a share with 
          them in their children by making them Magians, Jews and Christians, 
          so that they followed a religion other than the religion of Allaah and 
          gave a share of their wealth to the Shaytaan. This was also the view 
          of Qutaadah. Abu Saalih said, narrating from Ibn ‘Abbaas: this refers 
          to when they give their children names such as ‘Abd al-Haarith, ‘Abd 
          al-Shams and so on. 
 
          Ibn Jareer said: The most correct view is that every 
          child who is born of a woman concerning whom a sin is committed by giving 
          him a name which Allaah dislikes, or by initiating him into a religion 
          other than that with which Allaah is pleased, or by committing adultery 
          with his mother, or by killing him, or by burying him or her alive, 
          or other actions which involve sin and disobedience towards Allaah, 
          all come under the heading of the Shaytaan having a share in that with 
          the one to whom the child is born, because in the aayah ‘share with 
          them wealth and children’ Allaah did not specify one meaning to 
          the exclusion of any other. Every case where Allaah is disobeyed and 
          the Shaytaan is obeyed is a form of his sharing in that. 
 
          What he said is sound. Each of the salaf pointed out 
          some aspect in which the Shaytaan has a share. It was proven in Saheeh 
          Muslim (2865) from ‘Iyaad ibn Himaar that the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah said, ‘I created 
          My slaves as pure monotheists (haneefs), then the shayaateen (devils) 
          came to them and diverted them from their religion and forbade them 
          that which I had permitted to them.’”  
 
          In al-Saheehayn (al-Bukhaari, 3271; Muslim, 1434) 
          it is narrated that the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When any one of you 
          want to have intercourse with his wife, let him say, ‘Bismillaah, 
          jannibnaa al-shaytaan wa jannib al-Shaytaan ma razaqtana (In the 
          name of Allaah. Keep the Shaytaan away from us and from what You bestow 
          upon us).’ Then if it is decreed that they should have a child, the 
          Shaytaan will never be able to harm him.” 
 
          (Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 3/50-51) 
 
          al-Tabari said: 
 
          The most correct view is that every child who is born 
          of a woman concerning whom a sin is committed by giving him a name which 
          Allaah dislikes, or by initiating him into a religion other than that 
          with which Allaah is pleased, or by committing adultery with his mother, 
          or by killing him, or by burying him or her alive, or other actions 
          which involve sin and disobedience towards Allaah, all come under the 
          heading of the Shaytaan having a share in that with the one to whom 
          the child is born, because in the aayah ‘are with them wealth and 
          children’ Allaah did not specify one meaning to the exclusion of 
          any other. Every case where Allaah is disobeyed and the Shaytaan is 
          obeyed is a form of his sharing in that is giving Iblees a share in 
          that 
 
          (Tafseer al-Tabari, 15/120, 121) 
 
          Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di said: 
 
          “share with them wealth and children”. This includes 
          all kinds of sins that have to do with their wealth and children, such 
          as withholding zakaah, failing to give kafaaraat (expiation) 
          and to give people their dues, not disciplining and  training children 
          to do good and give up evil, taking wealth unlawfully or spending it 
          unlawfully, or using earnings gained from haraam sources. 
 
          Indeed, many of the mufassireen said that also included 
          in the Shaytaan’s share of wealth and children is neglecting to say 
          Bismillaah when eating, drinking or having intercourse; if one does 
          not say Bismillaah when doing those things, the Shaytaan has a share 
          in them, as was mentioned in the hadeeth. 
 
          Tayseer al-Kareem al-Rahmaan, 
          p. 414  
 
          I say: with regard to the Shaytaan sharing in intercourse 
          when a person fails to say Bismillaah, we have mentioned above the hadeeth 
          narrated by Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) and the comment 
          of Mujaahid (may Allaah have mercy on him). 
 
          Conclusion:
 
           The correct view on the meaning of this aayah is 
          that it should be interpreted in the ways mentioned above, for there 
          is no contradiction between these meanings. Each of the salaf mentioned 
          one aspect of its meanings, and there is no contradiction between them. 
          The basic principle in such a case is that the aayah should be interpreted 
          according to all its meanings. 
 
          Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
 
          The differences among the salaf concerning tafseer are 
          very small. Their differences concerning rulings are greater than their 
          differences concerning tafseer. Most of the differences narrated from 
          them in saheeh reports have to do with variations, not contradictions. 
          These are of two types: 
 
          The first is that each of them expresses the meaning 
          that he has in mind using words that differ from the words used by others, 
          each referring to a different aspect of the same thing… This is similar 
          to the case where different words are used to refer to a sword: al-saarim 
          (that which parts or cuts off) and al-muhannad (made from Indian iron).  
          And it is like the names of Allaah, the names of His Messenger, and 
          the names of the Qur’aan.  All of the names of Allaah refer to 
          One; calling upon Him by one of His Most Beautiful Names does not contradict 
          calling upon Him by one of His other Names. Rather it is as Allaah says 
          (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “Say (O Muhammad): ‘Invoke Allaah or invoke the Most 
          Gracious (Allaah), by whatever name you invoke Him (it is the same), 
          for to Him belong the Best Names’”
 
          [al-Israa’ 17:110]
 
          Each of His names refers to the same Essence and to the 
          attribute referred to in that name. So al-‘Aleem (the All-Knowing) refers 
          to His Essence and His knowledge; al-Qadeer (the All-Powerful) refers 
          to His Essence and His power; al-Raheem (the Most Merciful) refers to 
          His Essence and His mercy… 
 
          The second kind is when each of them refers to a specific 
          meaning by way of giving an example or drawing the attention of the 
          listener to an example, not in a precise and exclusive sense. This is 
          like when a non-Arab asks what the word khubz (bread) means, and someone 
          shows him a loaf of bread. He is referring to a type, not this specific 
          loaf.

What is the ruling on elongating the back excessively during prostration?

What is the ruling on raising one’s voice when reading the Qur’aan before the prayer?

What is the ruling on playing with one's beard or clothes needlessly during the prayer?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    With regard to taking the Mus-haf from the mosque, this is 
    not permitted, because the Mus-hafs of the mosque should stay in the mosque 
    and not be taken away. 

    With regard to elongating the back excessively during the 
    prostration, this is not appropriate. Rather the back should be moderate 
    when prostrating, not stretched out too much and not bent too much.  The 
    back should be moderate  with the arms lifted up off the ground and the 
    elbows away from the sides, and the stomach lifted up off the thighs, i.e., 
    one should follow a middle way, not stretching it or bending it too much.

     With regard to raising the voice when reciting Qur’aan 
    before the prayer, you should not raise your voice if there is anyone else 
    present, rather you should read quietly to yourself, so as not to disturb 
    other people or distract those who are praying or reading Qur’aan. But he 
    may raise his voice a little.

     With regard to playing with one’s beard or clothes while 
    praying, this is makrooh. The Sunnah is to remain still. Allaah says:

    “Successful indeed are the 
    believers.

    Those who offer their Salaah (prayers) with all solemnity 
    and full submissiveness”

    [al-Mu’minoon 23:1-2]

     So you have to be solemn in your prayer and not play with 
    your beard or clothes. A slight movement if necessary is forgiven, but a lot 
    of movement is not permitted unless absolutely necessary.","Mukhtaar min Fataawa al-Salaah by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, p. 14"
21949,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21949,Meaning of the hadeeth which says that Allah created Adam in His Image,"I am asking about the correct understanding of the hadith, “Adam was created in the Image of the Most Merciful”?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah created Adam in His Image…” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6227; Muslim, 2841. 
With regard to the hadith, “Do not (insult one another) and say ‘May Allah make your face ugly’, because Adam was created in the Image of the Most Merciful,” this was classed as da’eef (weak) by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah, no. 1176. 
Perhaps the questioner is confused by this hadith because of the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“There is nothing like Him”
[al-Shoora 42:11]
The scholars answered this problem in two ways: a brief answer and a detailed answer. 
The brief answer is that it is impossible for this hadith to contradict the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“There is nothing like Him”
[al-Shoora 42:11]
If we find a way to reconcile between them, all well and good, otherwise we should say, 
“ ‘We believe in it; the whole of it (clear and unclear Verses) are from our Lord.’ And none receive admonition except men of understanding”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:7 – interpretation of the meaning]
We believe that there is nothing like unto Allah and thus we will be on the safe side before Allah. These are the words of Allah, and these are the words of His Messenger; both are true and it is impossible for one of them to belie the other. So we say that the verse shows that His creation cannot resemble Allah, and the hadith affirms that Allah has an Image. Both are true and we believe in them; we say that both are from our Lord, and remain silent thereafter. This is all that we can do. 
See Sharh al-Waasitiyyah by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen. 
With regard to the detailed answer: 
This hadith proves that Allah has an Image, and that Allah created Adam in His Image. 
But there is nothing in this hadith to indicate that the image of Adam (peace be upon him) resembles the Image of Allah, rather this meaning is absolutely false and was not meant by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“There is nothing like Him”
[al-Shoora 42:11]
The fact that one thing is likened to another does not mean that it is identical to it in all aspects, rather they are likened to one another because they share some attributes, but that does not means that every attribute is identical. 
This is indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “The first group to be admitted to Paradise will be in the image of the moon on the night when it is full.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3327; Muslim, 2834. 
This hadith does not mean that they will enter Paradise in a form that is exactly like the moon in all regards, otherwise that would mean that they will enter Paradise with no eyes or mouths, or as rocks.  
Rather what the hadith means is that they will be like the moon in beauty and brightness, with shining faces, and so on. 
So if you say: what is the Image that belongs to Allah and in which Adam was created? We say that Allah has a Face and Eyes and Hands and Feet, but that does not mean that because of these things He resembles man. There may be some similarity but that does not mean that these things are identical, just as the first group of the people of Paradise to enter Paradise are likened to the moon, but that does not mean that they resemble the moon. This confirms the belief of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah, that none of the attributes of Allah can be likened to the attributes of created beings, and they do not misinterpret the Divine attributes or deny them, and they do not liken them to the attributes of human beings.

I for the time being live with them, and my Uncle my Mothers real brother lives with his parents i.e. in the same place as I do. While I mentiones this to some friends they said that I have to wear a Hijab infront of him. I do not agree because he is a Mahram even though he is a christian. Please help me with this.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Your maternal uncle is considered to be a mahram for you, and on this basis it is permissible for you to take off your hijab in front of him. There is no report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ordered the Muslim women to observe hijaab in front of their kaafir relatives. 
But the scholars have mentioned that the relative in front of whom the woman takes off her hijab should be trustworthy. This condition applies to both Muslims and kaafirs. 
They mentioned that in the context of women shaking hands with or kissing their relatives. But if her mahram is not trustworthy in the sense that he may describe her to others or be tempted by seeing her, then she should observe hijab in front of him, regardless of whether he is a Muslim or a kaafir. One of the unique opinions [mufridaat] of Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) is that he stated that the mahram who accompanies a Muslim woman when travelling must be a Muslim, but some of his companions did not agree with him on this condition. The reason why he did not allow a kaafir to be a mahram for travel purposes is that he is not trustworthy, especially if he is a Magian. He stated that such a person could not be a mahram for his mother because he thinks that it is permissible to have intercourse with her! One of his companions stated that a Jew or a Christian might sell his mother or kill her! If we look at these reasons we will see that they could be applied to some evildoers among the Muslims, so we can see that this is not a strong argument for the idea that a kaafir cannot be counted as a mahram because of his being a kaafir. But other considerations remain valid, such as his being trustworthy or otherwise.  
This has to with mahrams. In the case of non-mahrams who are kaafirs, there was a difference of opinion among the scholars as to whether it is permissible for a kaafir woman to see a Muslim woman. The most correct opinion is that it is permissible, and the prohibition applies in cases where one cannot be sure that the woman will not describe the Muslim woman to others who are non-mahrams to her, whether that woman is a Muslim or a kaafir. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthyameen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
Is it permissible for a Muslim woman to uncover her hair in front of a non-Muslim woman, especially if she will describe the Muslim woman to men among her relatives who are not Muslim? 
The answer was: 
This issue is based on differences of scholarly opinion concerning the interpretation of the aayah: 
“And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent (like both eyes for necessity to see the way, or outer palms of hands or one eye or dress like veil, gloves, headcover, apron), and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms) and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband’s fathers, or their sons, or their husband’s sons, or their brothers or their brother’s sons, or their sister’s sons, or their women …” [al-Noor 24:31]
The scholars differed as to the meaning of the pronoun in the word nisaa’ihinna (their women). Some of them said that what it referred to was the gender, i.e., women in general. Some of them said that what it referred to was a specific type of women, i.e., believing women only. 
According to the first view, it is permissible for a woman to uncover her hair and face in front of a non-Muslim woman, and according to the second opinion it is not permissible. 
We are inclined towards the first view, which is more likely to be correct, because when a woman is with another woman there is no difference between a Muslim woman and a non-Muslim woman. This is the case so long as there is no fitnah or temptation. But if there is the fear of fitnah, such as the risk that she may describe the Muslim woman to her male relatives, then it is essential to take precautions against fitnah in that case, and she should not uncover any part of her body such as her legs or hair in front of another woman, regardless of whether she is Muslim or not.

What advice can you give them?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a Muslim man or woman to delay an obligatory prayer beyond the proper time, rather every accountable Muslim man and woman is obliged to perform the prayers on time as much as they can. 
Work is not an excuse for delaying prayer, neither is impurity on clothes or clothes being dirty. None of these are acceptable excuses.
 People should be excused from work at prayer times; at the time of prayer a worker has to wash the impurity from his clothes, or change into clean clothes. As for regular dirt (as opposed to impurities), this does not prevent one from praying in those clothes, so long as that dirt is not impure and does not have an offensive smell that would bother other worshippers. But if the dirt or its smell will bother others, then he has to wash it before praying, or change into clean clothes so that he can pray in congregation.
 It is permissible for those who have legitimate shar’i excuses, such as those who are sick or are travelling, to combine Zuhr and ‘Asr at the time of either of them, and to combine Maghrib and ‘Isha’ at the time of either of them.
 This was narrated in the saheeh Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It is also permissible to join prayers when there is heavy rain or mud, which cause difficulty for people.","Fataawa Muhimmah tata’allaq bil-Salaah by Shaykh Ibn Baaz, p. 19"
21960,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21960,What is the reason why the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was incorporated into the mosque?,"It is well known that it is not permissible to bury the dead in the mosque, and it is not permissible to pray in any mosque in which there is a grave. So why were the graves of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and some of his companions incorporated into the Prophet’s Mosque?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It was narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “May Allah curse the Jews and the Christians, for they have taken the graves of their Prophets as places of worship.” (Saheeh, agreed upon. Al-Bukhaari, al-Janaa’iz, 1330; Muslim, al-Masaajid, 529). It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that Umm Salamah or Umm Habeebah told the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about a church that they had seen in Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and the images that were inside it. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Those are people who, when a righteous slave or a righteous man among them died, they would build a place of worship over his grave and put those images in it. They are the most evil of creation before Allah.” (Agreed upon; al-Bukhaari, al-Salaah, 434; Muslim, al-Masaajid, 528). Muslim narrated in his Saheeh that Jundub ibn ‘Abd-Allah al-Bajali said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, ‘Allah has taken me as a close friend (khaleel) as He took Ibraaheem as a close friend. If I were to take anyone among my ummah as a close friend, I would have taken Abu Bakr as a close friend. Those who came before you took the graves of their Prophets and righteous people as places of worship. Do not take graves as places of worship, for I forbid you to do that.” (Muslim, al-Janaa’iz, 970). 
Muslim also narrated that Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade plastering over graves, sitting on them, and building over them.” (Muslim, al-Janaa’iz, 970). These saheeh ahaadeeth and others all indicate that it is haraam to build mosques over graves, and that those who do that are cursed. They also indicate that it is haraam to build over graves, to erect domes over them or to plaster over them, because these actions lead to shirk involving the graves and worshipping their occupants instead of Allah, as happened in ancient times and is still happening today. So the Muslims, no matter where they are, must beware of doing that which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has forbidden, and not be deceived by what many people do. For the believer must follow the truth and truth may be known through evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnah, not by people’s opinions or what they do. The Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his two companions [Abu Bakr and ‘Umar] (may Allah be pleased with them) were not buried in the mosque, rather they were buried in the house of ‘Aa’ishah, but when the mosque was expanded during the time of al-Waleed ibn ‘Abd al-Malik, the room was incorporated into the mosque, at the end of the first century AH. His action does not come under the ruling of burial in the mosque, because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his two companions were not moved to the land of the mosque, rather the room in which they are buried was incorporated into the mosque because of the expansion. No one can use this as evidence that it is permissible to build structures over graves or to take graves as places of worship, or to bury people inside mosques, because of the saheeh ahaadeeth quoted above which forbid that. What al-Waleed did is not evidence for going against the proven Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).

21961,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21961,The wisdom behind jihad,Does Jihad only and simply mean to kill non Muslims?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    In Arabic, the word jihad means striving and expending one’s 
    energy. 

    In Islamic terminology, jihad means the Muslim striving to 
    make the word of Allaah supreme and to establish His religion on earth. 

    The purpose of jihad in Islam is not to kill non-Muslims, 
    rather the purpose is to establish the religion of Allaah on earth, to 
    establish the rule of His sharee’ah, and to bring people forth from the 
    worship of other people to the worship of the Lord of all people, from the 
    injustice of other religions to the justice of Islam. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And fight them until 
    there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and polytheism, i.e. worshipping others 
    besides Allaah), and the religion (worship) will all be for Allaah Alone”

    [al-Anfaal 8:39]

    Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di said in his commentary on 
    this verse: 
Here Allaah states the 
    purpose behind fighting for His sake, which is not to shed the blood of the 
    kaafirs and take their wealth; rather the purpose is so that all religion 
    (worship) will be for Allaah alone, and the religion of Allaah will prevail 
    over all other religions, and everything that goes against that, whether it 
    is shirk or anything else – which is what is meant by fitnah – will be 
    repelled. If this purpose is achieved, there will be no killing or 
    fighting. 

    Tafseer Ibn Sa’di, p., 98 

    The kuffaar whom we fight will themselves benefit from jihad. 
    We strive against them and fight them so that they will enter the religion 
    of Allaah which is acceptable to Him, which will lead to their salvation in 
    this world and in the Hereafter. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“You (true believers in 
    Islamic Monotheism, and real followers of Prophet Muhammad and his Sunnah) 
    are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind; you enjoin Al-Ma‘roof 
    (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained) and forbid 
    Al‑Munkar (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden), and you 
    believe in Allaah”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:110]

    al-Bukhaari (4557) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: “ ‘You are the best of peoples ever raised up for 
    mankind’ means: the best of people for people, you bring them with 
    chains around their necks until they enter Islam.” 

    Ibn al-Jawzi said: What this means is that they captured (in 
    war) and chained as prisoners, but when they come to know the truth of 
    Islam, they enter it willingly and will thus enter Paradise.

Is this permissible?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    There is no basis for this; it was not done at the time of 
    the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) and it is not something that 
    they taught. It also disturbs the others who are praying with the imaam, and 
    disturbing other worshippers is something that is not allowed, because it 
    distracts them. 

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    went out one night to his companions when they were praying and raising 
    their voices in recitation. He told them not to do that and said: “Do not 
    raise your voices above one another when reciting Qur’aan.” (Maalik in 
    al-Muwatta’, al-Salaah, 29). According to another hadeeth: “Do 
    not disturb one another and do not raise your voices above one another when 
    reciting Qur’aan.” (Abu Dawood, al-Salaah, 1332). This indicates that 
    everything that disturbs the people who are praying behind the imaam is 
    forbidden, because it disturbs the worshippers and interferes with their 
    prayer.

     With regard to the imaam, the fuqaha’ (may Allaah have mercy 
    on them) said: if the imaam senses that someone has come in to join the 
    prayer, then he should wait for him, especially in the last rak’ah in which 
    the latecomer may catch up with the jamaa’ah, because the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever catches up with a 
    rak’ah of the prayer has caught up with the prayer.” (al-Bukhaari, 
    al-Mawaaqeet, 580; Muslim, al-Masaajid, 607). But if it will 
    cause any hardship for the members of the congregation then he should not 
    wait, because they are more deserving of consideration than the one who has 
    just come in, because they were there before him.","Mukhtaaraat min Fataawa al-Salaah, by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, p.73"

There is nothing wrong with shortening the prayer occasionally, if there is a need to do so, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do. But ordinarily the imam must adhere to the Sunnah. So adhere to the Sunnah and tell the people that if they are patient in doing so they will earn the reward of those who are patient in obeying Allaah. If the matter of what is too short or too long were left to people’s whims and desires, the ummah would have split into factions. What is moderate to some may be too long for others, so you should follow what is narrated in the Sunnah, which is well known, praise be to Allaah.
 Hence I advise every imaam who leads the Muslims in prayer in the mosques to strive to recite what is written by the scholars describing the prayer of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), such as Kitaab al-Salaah by Ibn al-Qayyim, which is a well-known book, and what he mentioned in Zaad al-Ma’aad fi Hadi Khayr al-‘Ibaad.","Kitaab al-Da’wah, 5, Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 2/90"

          for a hypocrite who was known for his hypocrisy or one who was sick. 
          A man would be brought to the prayers, supported by two others, so that 
          he could stand in the row.""
In al-Saheehayn it is narrated that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""I was thinking 
          of commanding that the call to prayer should be given, then the iqaamah, 
          then I would command a man to lead the people in prayer, and I would 
          go out with some men carrying bundles of wood to people who do not attend 
          the prayers, and I would burn their houses with them inside."" There 
          are many ahaadeeth which speak of the importance of the prayer and urge 
          us to pray in the mosques. It is obligatory for the Muslims to pray 
          regularly in the mosques and encourage one another to do that and to 
          co-operate in doing so… But in the case of one who is far away from 
          the mosque and cannot hear the call to prayer except via the loudspeaker, 
          he is not obliged to attend the mosque and he and others who are with 
          him can pray in jamaa'ah on their own, because of the apparent meaning 
          of the ahaadeeth quoted above. But if they take on the hardship and 
          join the congregation in the mosque from which they cannot hear the 
          call to prayer except via loudspeakers, because they are far away from 
          it, that will increase their reward, because the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ""The people who 
          will earn the greatest reward for prayer are those who live farthest 
          away, (and the further away you live, the more reward you will earn)."" 
          And there are very many ahaadeeth which speak of the virtues of going 
          to the mosque and encourage us to do so. And Allaah is the Source of 
          strength.
 Majmoo' Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah 
          have mercy on him), vol. 12, 58-61
The scholars said concerning the guidelines on hearing 
          the call to prayer (adhaan):
Al-Shaafa'i (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: [the 
          guideline is the distance within which the adhaan can be heard] if the 
          muezzin has a loud voice and a person can hear (i.e., he is not deaf), 
          and there is little noise and the wind is still – because if the muezzin 
          does not have a loud voice, and the people are not paying attention, 
          and there is a lot of noise, then fewer people would hear the call.
 Al-Umm, vol. 1, p. 221
Al-Nawawi said: the guideline with regard to hearing the 
          call to prayer is that the muezzin stands at a certain location in the 
          city, there is no noise and the wind is still, and a person can hear 
          him; if a person can hear him he is obliged to attend the prayers in 
          the mosque, and if he cannot hear him, he is not obliged.
(al-Majmoo' Sharh al-Muhadhdhab, vol. 4, p. 353
Ibn Qudaamah said: The furthest place from which the call 
          can usually be heard– if the muezzin has a strong voice and stands in 
          a high place, and the wind is still and there is no noise, and the listener 
          is not inattentive – is the distance which is to be taken into account.

21970,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21970,Can a woman pray in her house wearing perfume and jewellery?,Can u plz answer if it is allowed for woman to have rings or bracelet on their hand when they are praying....and also is it okay if woman have perfume on them when they are praying in their own house by themself...or do they have to take perfume/rings..off,,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          The concise answer is that a woman 
          is permitted to pray wearing jewellery and perfume; doing that does 
          not invalidate her prayer in any way. 
 
          The detailed answer is that it 
          is forbidden for her to wear perfume when going out to the mosque to 
          pray. Muslim narrated in his Saheeh from Zaynab the wife of ‘Abd-Allaah, 
          who said: “The Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘If any of you (women) 
          attend the mosque, do not wear perfume.’” (al-Salaah, 674). Ibn 
          Hajar said: “This also applies to other similar things, because the 
          reason why perfume is forbidden is that it provokes desire in men, as 
          do beautiful clothes, jewellery that is visible, fancy adornments and 
          mixing with men.”
 
           It is clear that the reason 
          why a woman is forbidden to wear perfume or wear adornments when going 
          out to pray in the mosque is because of the consequences that may result, 
          namely temptation and evil. 
 
          Because a great deal of mischief 
          is caused when women wear perfume when going to the mosque, this is 
          forbidden when she is going out. This problem is not present when she 
          does that (wears perfume) at home, so it is not forbidden, and that does not affect her prayer. And Allaah knows best. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

          The Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) rode horses, camels, mules 
          and donkeys. He rode horses both saddled and bareback, and he used to 
          make them gallop them on occasion. He used to ride alone, which was 
          most of the time, but sometimes he would put someone behind him on the 
          camel, or he would put one person behind him and one in front, so there 
          would be three men on one camel. So he would sometimes let some men 
          ride on his camel with him, and on some occasions he let his wives ride 
          with him. The animals which he rode most often were horses and camels. 
          With regard to mules, it is known that he had one mule which was given 
          to him as a gift by one of the kings. Mules were not well known in the 
          land of the Arabs, and when he was given a mule, it was asked, “Why 
          do we not mate horses with donkeys?” He said, “That is only done by 
          those who do not know.”

For all of those years, I wanted so much to be a Muslim wife and mother, but since I live in a very small Muslim community (XXX), this did not happen.
A month ago I sent out my resume to find work in an Islamic school in a large Islamic community. The imam of an Islamic center in Florida left several messages on my answering machine. Days later, a brother called from the same masjid and said that he had lived in America for 10 years (he is originally from Saudi Arabia) and was looking for a wife. He is over thirty. He said that he wanted to marry me after he read my resume. (The imam gave him my resume since he knew he was looking for a wife.I was a college student of Islamic Studies.
I live with my mother who is a Muslim, but I have no male Muslim relatives. I do not know any Muslims in Florida either. This brother has continued to call me and talk to me while my mother is nearby and he also spoke with my mother and told her that he wanted her permission to marry me.
I want very much to get married In Sha' Allah, but I am very worried. I feel very vulnerable because I do not have a Muslim male relative who can check this brother out. Sadly I have heard of brothers who come to America and date women for years, or are involved in other bad activities. I am worried about this.
He has talked a lot about his love for Islam and da'wah. He says he is so happy that I have a Muslim mother and he wants me to support me if we get married and possibly move to Saudi Arabia. But I was worried also because he said that he has had a beard most of the time, but has on occasion shaved it off. This concerns me because I know keeping the beard is important and is Sunnah.
The most important quality for me in a husband is both his belief and practice of Islam. Books I have read on Islamic marriage say that you will never find a perfect spouse, but to look for their religiousness. How do I know if this brother is good or not? How do I know if he is really committed to islam? What should I look for? Please help, In Sha' Allah.

If there is no Muslim ruler, then the wali is a person to whom other Muslims refer, or one who is influential among them, in the place where you live, such as the director of the Islamic center or the imaam or khateeb.

21975,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21975,Giving zakaah to someone who wants to get married,"One of my friends wants to get married, but he does not have enough money to cover the expenses of getting married. Is it permissible for me to help him and to count that money as part of my zakaah?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Yes, it is permissible to give zakaah to someone who wants to 
    get married, if he does not have enough money to get married. This is 
    included in the eight categories mentioned in the verse in which Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “As-Sadaqaat (here it means Zakaah) are only for the 
    Fuqaraa’ (poor), and Al-Masaakeen(the poor) and those 
    employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have 
    been inclined (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in 
    debt; and for Allaah’s Cause (i.e. for Mujaahidoon — those fighting in a 
    holy battle), and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from 
    everything); a duty imposed by Allaah. And Allaah is All-Knower, All-Wise”

    [al-Tawbah 9:60]

    The one who does not have enough money is poor, so it is 
    permissible to give him zakaah. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: If we find a person who can earn 
    enough for food and drink and accommodation, but he needs to get married and 
    does not have enough to do so, is it permissible for us to get him married 
    using zakaah funds? The answer is: yes, it is permissible to get him married 
    using zakaah funds, and to give him the mahr in full.  

    If it is said: how come it is permissible to get a poor man 
    married using zakaah funds even if what is given to him is a large amount? 
    We say:  because a man’s need to get married is urgent, and in some cases it 
    may be like his need for food and drink. Hence the scholars said that the 
    one who is obliged to spend on a person must marry him off if he can afford 
    that. So the father must marry his son off if the son needs to get married 
    but does not have the means of doing so. But I heard that some fathers 
    forget how they were when they were young, and when their sons ask them to 
    help them get married, they say: “Pay for marriage from your own pocket.” 
    This is not permissible, and it is haraam if he is able to get him married. 
    His son will confront him on the Day of Resurrection if he does not get him 
    married when he is able to.

    him get married, if he cannot afford it.

Raising hands for du’a after prayer","Praise be to Allah.Making du’a after salah
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah: 
“Making du’a after the obligatory prayers is not Sunnah if it is done by raising the hands, whether that is done by the imam alone or a member of the congregation alone, or it is done by them both together. Rather that is bid’ah, because it was not narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or any of his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) did that. With regard to making du’a without doing that (raising the hands etc.), there is nothing wrong with it, because there are some ahadith concerning that.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 7/103)
Raising hands for du’a after prayer
The Committee was asked about raising the hands for du’a after the five daily prayers – is it proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) raised his hands or not? If it is not proven, is it permissible to raise the hands after the five daily prayers or not? 
They replied: 
“It is not proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) raised his hands in du’a after the obligatory prayers as far as we know, so raising them after the salam of an obligatory prayer is contrary to the Sunnah.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah, 7/104) 
The Committee also stated that saying du’a out loud after the five daily prayers or regular Sunnah prayers, or reciting du’a in unison as a regular practice is a reprehensible innovation (bid’ah), because it was not proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) did anything like that. 
Whoever makes du’a after the obligatory or regular Sunnah prayers in unison is going against the way of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah, and for those people to accuse those who disagree with them of being kafirs and not belonging to Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah, is misguidance, ignorance and a distortion of the facts.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 1/319)

It is worth pointing out in this context that the Palestinian issue is an Islamic issue, first and last, but the enemies of Islam are striving their utmost to remove it from the Islamic map and make the non-Arab Muslims think that it is an Arab issue that does not concern the non-Arabs. It seems that they have succeeded in that to some extent. 
Hence I think that a solution cannot be reached in this matter unless it is regarded as an Islamic issue and the Muslims cooperate to find a solution, and wage an Islamic jihad against the Jews, until the land is given back to its people and the Jewish immigrants go back to the countries from which they came, and the original Jewish inhabitants stay in their towns under Islamic rule, not communist or secular rule. In this manner truth will prevail and falsehood will be defeated, and the people whose land it is will return to their land under Islamic rule and none other.

Types of Specific voluntary fasts


Sunnah days to fast


Periods when it is Sunnah to fast


Precise timing of Suhur and Iftar","Praise be to Allah.By His Wisdom, Allah has prescribed that His slaves should voluntarily seek to draw closer to Him, after performing the obligatory acts of worship, by doing more of the same kinds of acts of worship, and He has assigned to that great rewards, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us that his Lord said: “My slave does not draw near to Me with anything more beloved to Me than the religious duties I have enjoined upon him, and My slave continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory works so that I will love him, When I love him, I am his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask [something] of Me, I would surely give it to him, and were he to ask Me for refuge, I would surely grant him it.” (al-Bukhari, 6502) 
Types of voluntary fasting
Nafl fasts fall into two main categories: 

General voluntary fasts (i.e., not restricted to any particular time or circumstances). The Muslim may observe a voluntary fast on any day of the year that he wishes, except those which are known to be forbidden, such as the two ‘Eid days, on which fasting is haram, and Ayyam al-Tashriq (the three days following ‘Eid al-Adha), on which fasting is haram except on Hajj for those who do not have a hadiy (animal for sacrifice). Also excluded is deliberately singling out Friday for fasting, because it was reported that this is not allowed. One of the best forms of voluntary fasting is to fast alternate days for those who are able to do that, as it says in the hadith: “The most beloved prayer to Allah is the prayer of Dawud (peace be upon him), and the most beloved fasting to Allah is the fasting of Dawud. He used to sleep half the night, stand in prayer for one-third of the night, and sleep for one-sixth, and he used to fast alternate days.” (al-Bukhari, 1131; Muslim, 1159) 

In order for this kind of fasting to be regarded as virtuous, it should not weaken a person and make him unable to do his primary duties, as it says in the hadith: “he used to fast alternate days, and he never ran away from battle (because he used to break his fast at times of jihad).” (al-Bukhari, 1977; Muslim, 1159) 

Specific voluntary fasts. These are superior to general voluntary fasts, and are of two types: 

Types of Specific voluntary fasts

The first type is fasts which are specific to a type of person, such as young men who cannot get married, as mentioned in the hadith of ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him): “We were young men with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and we did not have anything (i.e., we could not afford to get married). The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to us, ‘O young men, whoever among you can afford to get married, then let him do so, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding chastity. And whoever is not able to do that, then let him fast, for that will be a shield for him.’” (al-Bukhari, 5066; Muslim, 1400) 

This kind of fasting is more emphasized so long as a person is single, and this prescription is more emphatic the more provocation there is. There is no mention of any specific number of days in this case. 

The second type is fasts prescribed at specific times, which vary, with some being weekly, some monthly and some annual. 


The weekly fasts are on Monday and Thursday , on which days fasting is mustahabb. It was narrated that ‘Aishah said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was keen to fast on Mondays and Thursdays.” (al-Nasai, 2320; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’ al-Saghir, 4827). 

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about fasting on Mondays and Thursdays, and he said: “Those are two days on which people’s deeds are shown to the Lord of the Worlds, and I want my deeds to be shown to Him when I am fasting.” (Al-Nasai, 2358; Ibn Majah, 1740; Ahmad, 8161; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 1583). He was asked about fasting on Mondays and he said, “On that day I was born and on that day revelation came to me.” (Muslim, 1162) 

With regard to the monthly fasts, it is mustahabb to fast on three days of each month. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “My close friend [i.e., the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] advised me to do three things which I will never give up until I die: fasting three days each month, praying Duha, and sleeping after praying Witr.” (al-Bukhari, 1178; Muslim, 721). It is mustahabb to observe this fast in the middle of the hijri month, on the days called Ayyam al-Bid . 

It was narrated that Abu Dharr said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to me, ‘If you fast any part of the month then fast on the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth.’” (al-Nasai, 2424; Ibn Majah, 1707; Ahmad, 210; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’ al-Saghir, 673) 

Annual fasts are observed on specific days, or during periods when it is Sunnah to fast. 

Sunnah days to fast
The specific days include the following: 

The day of `Ashura which is the tenth of al-Muharram . It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) was asked about fasting on the day of `Ashura. He said, “I do not know of any day on the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fasted that was better than this day and any month that was better than this month, meaning Ramadan.” (al-Bukhari, 2006; Muslim, 1132). It is Sunnah to fast the day before or the day after along with `Ashura, in order to be different from the Jews.
The day of `Arafah , which is the ninth day of Dhu’l-Hijjah. It is mustahabb only for those who are not standing in `Arafah itself, as the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said concerning the virtue of the three fasts mentioned above: “The observance of three days' fast every month and that of Ramadan every year is equivalent to fasting for the entire year. I seek from Allah that fasting on the day of `Arafah may atone for the sins of the preceding and the coming years, and I seek from Allah that fasting on the day of `Ashura may atone for the sins of the preceding year.” (Muslim, 1162). 

Periods when it is Sunnah to fast
The periods during which it is Sunnah to fast include the following: 

The month of Shawwal . It is Sunnah to fast six days of Shawwal, because the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever fasts Ramadan then fasts six days of Shawwal, it is as if he fasted for a lifetime.” (Muslim, 1164).
The month of Muharram: it is Sunnah to fast whatever one can of this month, because of the hadith: “The best of fasting after Ramadan is the month of Allah al-Muharram, and the best of prayer after the obligatory prayers is prayer at night (qiyam al-layl).” (Muslim, 1163)
The month of Sha`ban, as it was narrated that ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fast until we thought that he would never break his fast, and he would not fast until we thought that he would never fast. I never saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fast an entire month apart from Ramadan, and the month in which I saw him fast the most was Sha’ban. He used to fast all of Sha`ban or all of it apart from a few days.”  (al-Bukhari, 1969; Muslim, 1156) 

The Muslim who is keen to do good must realize the great virtue of performing voluntary fasts for the sake of Allah, as it says in the hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Whoever fasts one day for the sake of Allah, Allah will keep his face seventy years’ distance from Hell,” (al-Nasai, 2247; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Sunan al-Nasai, 2121)
We ask Allah to make us among those whose faces He keeps far away from Hell and its heat, and to bless us with Paradise. 
Precise timing of Suhur and Iftar
With regard to the precise timing of Suhur and Iftar:
As mentioned in the definition of fasting, fasting means abstaining from food, drink and all other things that break the fast from dawn until sunset, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your Sawm (fast) till the nightfall” [Al-Baqarah 2:187]
So the fasting person must begin to abstain from things that break the fast when dawn begins and continue until the sun has set. 
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said concerning the time of iftar: “When the night has come from here and the day has gone from here, and the sun has set, then let the fasting person break his fast.” (al-Bukhari, 1818; Muslim, 1841). 
With regard to the time of suhur, the majority of jurists said that it is the time from the last half of the night until the second dawn. It is Sunnah to delay it, according to the majority of scholars, so long as the second dawn has not begun, because of the verse quoted above and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Hasten iftar and delay suhur.” (Narrated by al-Tabarani and classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 3989).
The purpose of suhur is to give one strength to fast, so the closer it is to dawn the more effective it will be in helping one to fast. We ask Allah to make us among those who adhere to His laws and act according to them. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad.

If the owner of the factory adds a specific amount for each piece that the customer takes, and I take this extra amount in return for the customer buying this product, is that permissible? If it is not permissible, then what is the kind of commission that is permissible?","If the commission that you take from the owner of the factory or store is added to the price paid by the purchaser, it is not permissible for you to take it.",,"Praise be to Allah.The Standing Committee for Fatwa and Research said:
“If the factory-owner or shopkeeper gives you part of the money from each product that is sold through you, in payment for your efforts to find him customers, and this money is not added to the price of the product and that does not cause problems to others who sell the same product, and this factory or store sells it for the same price as others, then this is permissible and there is nothing wrong with it.
But if this money that you take from the owner of the factory or store is added to the price paid by the purchaser, it is not permissible for you to take it and it is not permissible for the vendor to do that, because this is harming the purchaser by making him pay a higher price.

21981,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21981,Ruling on giving zakah to Ahl al-Bayt,Is it permissible to give zakah to Ahl al-Bayt?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Ahl al-Bayt (the members of the Prophet’s household) are the tribe of ‘Abd al-Muttalib (the descendents of ‘Ali, the descendents of ‘Abbaas, the descendents of Ja’far, the descendents of ‘Aqeel, the descendents of al-Haarith and the sons of ‘Abd al-Muttalib), and their freed slaves. See al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 1/100; al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/258). 
It is not permissible to give zakah to Ahl al-Bayt, because of the evidence narrated forbidding that to them, including the report narrated by Imam Muslim (may Allah have mercy on him) from ‘Abd al-Muttalib ibn Rabee’ah ibn al-Haarith (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘zakah should not be given to the family of Muhammad because it is from the dirt of the people.’” (Narrated by Muslim, al-zakah, 1784). Al-Nawawi said concerning the phrase “zakah should not be given to the family of Muhammad”, this indicates that it is forbidden whether that is because of their involvement in the collection and distribution of zakah or because of their poverty and need, or for any of the other eight reasons. This is the correct view according to our companions. 
“because it is from the dirt of the people” points towards the reason for the prohibition… that is in order to honour them and demonstrate that they are above receiving any dirt. The meaning of the phrase “the dirt of the people” is because it is to purify their wealth and their souls, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“  Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it”[al-Tawbah 9:103] 
So it is like washing away something dirty. 
This ruling – that zakah is forbidden for the Ahl al-Bayt – is because they have other sources from which money may be given to them if they are in need of it, such as the khums or one-fifth of war booty, people’s gifts, and others. 
If these sources are no longer available to them, and some of them are in need of money and we cannot find anything other than the zakah money, then it is permissible, indeed obligatory, to give zakah to them, and they are more entitled to it than others, because of the Prophet’s advice to take care of them. This was the view of some of the salaf and was regarded as the more correct view by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), and Shaykh Muhammad al-Saalih ibn ‘Uthaymeen agreed with him. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
If Bani Haashim are deprived of one-fifth of the khums, it is permissible for them to receive zakah. This is the view of al-Qaadi Ya’qoob and others among our companions. It is also the view of Abu Yoosuf and al-Istakhri among the Shaafa’is, because this is a case of need and necessity. 
Al-Fatawa al-Kubra, 5/374 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
If they are deprived or there is no khums as is the case nowadays, then they may be given zakah funds to meet their needs if they are poor and they have no work. This is the view of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and it is the correct view.

21982,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21982,He wants something that will guide him in his worldly and religious affairs,Can you advise us of something that will guide us in our worldly and religious affairs?,,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was asked the following 
          question: 
 
          I ask the shaykh and imaam, the follower of the salaf 
          (earlier generations) and the leader of the later generations, the most 
          knowledgeable man whom I have met in the east or the west, Taqiy al-Deen 
          Abu’l-Abbaas Ahmad Ibn Taymiyah, to advise me of something that will 
          guide me in my worldly and religious affairs. 
 
          He (may Allaah have mercy on him) replied as follows: 
 
          With regard to advice, I do not know of any advice more 
          beneficial than the advice of Allaah and His Messenger, for those who 
          understand it and follow it: 
 
          “And verily, We have recommended to the people of 
          the Scripture before you, and to you (O Muslims) that you (all) fear 
          Allaah, and keep your duty to Him”[al-Nisaa’ 4:131]
 
          The Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) advised Mu’aadh, when he 
          sent him to Yemen, “O Mu’aadh, fear Allaah wherever you are, and follow 
          up a bad deed with a good deed, and it will wipe it out, and treat people 
          in a kind manner.”  Mu’aadh (may Allaah be pleased with him) was 
          held in high esteem by the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he said to him, “O 
          Mu’aadh, by Allaah I love you.” And he used to let him ride behind him. 
          It was narrated that he was the most knowledgeable of this ummah concerning 
          halaal and haraam, that he will be gathered (on the Day of Resurrection) 
          one step ahead of the scholars. One of his virtues is that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent him to Yemen to convey 
          the message from him, as a daa’iyah, mufti and judge for the people 
          of Yemen. And he used to liken him to Ibraaheem (peace be upon him), 
          and Ibraaheem was a leader of mankind. 
 
          And Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) used 
          to say that Mu’aadh was an ummah (a leader having all the good righteous 
          qualities), obedient to Allaah, and he was not one of the mushrikeen 
          (cf. al-Nahl 16:120), likening him to Ibraaheem (peace be upon him). 
 
          Moreover, the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave him this advice, so 
          we should note that it is concise and comprehensive. It is like that 
          for the one who understands it, even though it is an interpretation 
          of advice given in the Qur’aan. 
 
          With regard to its conciseness, that is because each 
          person has two duties: his duty towards Allaah and his duty towards 
          others. It is inevitable that he will fall short sometimes with regard 
          to those duties, either by failing to do something he is commanded to 
          do or by doing something he is forbidden to do. So the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Fear Allaah wherever 
          you are.” This is a comprehensive phrase. The words “wherever you are” 
          refer to the need for taqwa in secret and in the open. Then he said: 
          “and follow up a bad deed with a good deed, and it will wipe it out”. 
          For when the doctor sees a patient and realizes that he has ingested 
          something harmful, he will tell him to take something that is good for 
          him. Sin is something inevitable for man, so the smart man is the one 
          who keeps doing good deeds so that they will wipe out his bad deeds. 
 
          In the wording of the hadeeth, the word sayi’ah (bad 
          deed) is mentioned first, even though it is the object, because the 
          aim here is to wipe out bad deeds, not to emphasize good deeds. 
 
           The good deeds should be of a similar nature to 
          the bad deeds, for that will be more effective in wiping them out. The 
          consequences of sin may be erased by several things, the first of which 
          is repentance, and the second is seeking forgiveness (istighfaar) without 
          repenting, for Allaah may forgive him in response to his du’aa’ even 
          though he has not repented. But if repentance and seeking forgiveness 
          are combined, this is perfect. The third thing is doing righteous deeds 
          that expiate for sin.
 
           With regard to specific acts of expiation, such 
          as those prescribed for one who has intercourse during the day in Ramadaan, 
          one who divorces his wife by zihaar (a jaahili form of divorce by which 
          a man says to his wife “You are to me as my mother’s back), the one 
          who commits some actions which are forbidden during Hajj or who fails 
          to fulfil some of its obligations and the one who hunts during Hajj, 
          these expiations are of four types: offering a sacrifice, freeing a 
          slave, giving in charity and fasting. With regard to kinds of expiation 
          that are not specified, as Hudhayfah said to ‘Umar: The fitnah faced 
          by a man (i.e., his shortcomings with regard to religious duties) because 
          of his family, wealth and children may be expiated by prayer, fasting, 
          charity and enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil. This 
          is indicated by the Qur’aan and the saheeh ahaadeeth which speak of 
          expiation via the five daily prayers, Jumu’ah, fasting, Hajj and all 
          the actions concerning which it is said, whoever says such and such 
          or does such and such, he will be forgiven, or his previous sins will 
          be forgiven. There are many such reports in the books of Sunan, 
          especially those books which have been written concerning virtuous deeds. 
 
          It should be noted that paying attention to such matters 
          is one of the things of which man is in the greatest need. When a person 
          reaches the age of puberty, especially in these times and similar periods 
          which resemble the time of jaahiliyyah in so many ways, the person who 
          grows up among knowledgeable and religious people may be affected by 
          matters of jaahiliyyah to some extent, so how about others? 
 
          In al-Saheehayn it is narrated in the hadeeth 
          of Abu Sa’eed (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “You will follow the 
          path of those who came before you step by step, so that even if they 
          entered the hole of a lizard, you will enter it too.” They said, “O 
          Messenger of Allaah, do you mean the Jews and Christians?” He said, 
          “Who else?” This report is confirmed by the aayah (interpretation of 
          the meaning): 
 
          “so enjoy your portion (awhile) as those before you 
          enjoyed their portion (awhile); and you indulged in play and pastime 
          (and in telling lies against Allaah and His Messenger Muhammad) as they 
          indulged in play and pastime”
 
          [al-Tawbah 9:69]
 
          And there are further corroborating reports in the saheeh 
          and hasan ahaadeeth. This is something which affects those among the 
          elite who claim to be religiously committed, as more than one of the 
          salaf, including Ibn ‘Uyayanah, said. For many of the characteristics 
          of the Jews are things from which some of those who claim to be knowledgeable 
          are suffering, and many of the characteristics of the Christians are 
          things from which some of those who claim to be religiously-committed 
          are suffering – as is clear to everyone who understands the religion 
          of Islam with which Allaah sent Muhammad 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then tries to understand 
          people in the light of Islam. 
 
          If this is the case, then the one whose heart Allaah 
          opens to Islam will be following light from his Lord, for he was dead 
          then Allaah revived him and gave him light by which to walk among mankind. 
          So he will inevitably notice the characteristics of jaahiliyyah and 
          the path of the two nations with whom Allaah is angry and who have gone 
          astray, namely the Jews and Christians, and he will see that he is also 
          afflicted with some of that. 
 
          The most useful thing that both the elite and the common 
          folk may know is that which will cleanse their souls of these bad effects, 
          and that is following bad deeds with good deeds. Good deeds are those 
          which Allaah has encouraged on the lips of the final Prophet, whether 
          they are actions, attitudes or characteristics. Among the things which 
          remove the consequences of sin are disasters or calamities which expiate 
          sin; these include all kinds of anxiety, grief or harm with regard to 
          wealth, honour, one’s body, and so on, but which are not brought about 
          by a person’s own actions. 
 
          When the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had stated the rights of 
          Allaah with regard to doing righteous deeds and putting right bad deeds, 
          he then said, “and treat people in a kind manner”. This refers to one’s 
          duty towards other people. A good attitude towards other people is based 
          on maintaining contact with one who cuts you off by greeting him with 
          salaam, honouring him, making du’aa’ for him, praying for  forgiveness 
          for him, praising him and visiting him; giving to one who has deprived 
          you of knowledge, benefits and money; forgiving one who has wronged 
          you with regard to blood, wealth or honour. Some of these matters are 
          waajib (obligatory) and some are mustahabb (encouraged). 
 
          With regard to the “exalted standard of character” [al-Qalam 
          68:4] with which Allaah described Muhammad 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), this is the religion which 
          includes all that Allaah has enjoined. Hence Mujaahid said that he was 
          the interpretation of the Qur’aan, as ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased 
          with her) said: “His character was the Qur’aan.” The essence of his 
          character was that he hastened to do what Allaah loves with a willing 
          spirit and an open heart. All of this may be summed up in the word taqwa 
          (fear of Allaah), which includes doing everything that Allaah has enjoined 
          whether it is waajib (obligatory) or mustahabb (recommended), and avoiding 
          all that He has forbidden, whether it is haraam (forbidden) or makrooh 
          (disliked). This combines both duties towards Allaah and duties towards 
          other people. But as taqwa may sometimes mean fearing the punishment 
          which makes one refrain from forbidden things, it was explained in the 
          hadeeth of Mu’aadh. Similarly, in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah 
          be pleased with them) which was narrated and classed as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi, 
          “it was said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, which thing most commonly brings 
          people into Paradise?’ He said, ‘Fear of Allaah (taqwa) and a good attitude.’ 
          It was said, ‘And which thing most commonly brings people into Hell?’ 
          He said, ‘The two hollow things: the mouth and the private parts.’” 
 
          In al-Saheeh it is narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn 
          ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The most perfect 
          of the believers in faith is the one who is best in attitude.” So he 
          connected perfection of faith to good attitude. It is well known that 
          faith is all fear of Allaah (taqwa), but this is not the place to discuss 
          the basic principles and minor details of that. This is the whole of 
          religion, but the source of goodness is sincere devotion of the slave 
          to his Lord, worshipping Him alone and seeking His help alone, as in 
          the aayahs (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for 
          help (for each and everything)” [al-Faatihah 1:5]
 
          “So worship Him (O Muhammad) and put your trust in 
          Him”[Hood 11:123] 
 
          “in Him I trust and unto Him I repent”[Hood 11:88]
 
          “so seek your provision from Allaah (Alone), and worship 
          Him (Alone), and be grateful to Him” [al-‘Ankaboot 29:17]
 
          Thus the slave does away with any hope of benefiting 
          from created beings and does not strive for their sake, and he focuses 
          all his concern on his Lord, by praying to him for all his needs, fears, etc., and striving to do all that He loves.","Quoted from the essay al-Wasiyyah al-Jaami’ah li Khayr al-Dunya wa’l-Aakhirah, by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him), published by al-Maktabah al-Salafiyyah, Cairo"

    If the imaam says the salaam and the person who joined the

    have caught up with the jamaa’ah that they still come under the ruling of 
    those who are behind the imaam even after they have begun to pray alone

But after that they differed as to whether it is simply Sunnah or it is not one of the obligatory parts of prayer at all, or whether it should be done by those who need to do it because of old age, sickness or being heavy.
 Al-Shafaa’i and a group of hadeeth scholars said: it is Sunnah and it is one of the two opinions narrated from Ahmad, because of the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari and the authors of al-Sunan from Maalik ibn al-Huwayrith, who said that he saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) praying Witr, and he did not stand up until he had first sat up straight. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari in al-Adhaan, 818).
 But the majority of scholars, including Abu Haneefah and Maalik, and Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) according to the second opinion narrated from him, did not think that, because the other ahaadeeth do not mention this sitting. It may be that the sitting which was mentioned in the hadeeth of Maalik ibn al-Huwayrith happened at the end of the Prophet’s life when he had put on weight, or for some other reason.
 A third group of scholars reconciled the ahaadeeth by suggesting that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sat [at this point during the prayer] when he needed to do so.
 I say that it is prescribed to do this when there is a need to do so, but not at other times. It appears that this is mustahabb, and the fact that it is not mentioned in the other ahaadeeth does not indicate that it is not mustahabb, rather it indicates that it is not obligatory.
 The view that it is mustahabb is supported by two things:
 1 – The basic principle concerning the Prophet’s actions is that he did them in order to prescribe them and so that his example may be followed.
 2 – This sitting is proven in the hadeeth of Abu Humayd al-Saa’idi which was narrated by Ahmad and Abu Dawood with a jayyid isnaad, in which he [Abu Humayd] described the prayer of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the presence of ten of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them), and they confirmed that.","Al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah in Fataawa Islamiyyah, 1/268"
21996,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21996,The traveller has to offer the prayer in full if he prays behind an imam who is offering it in full,"Is it permissible for a traveller who prays behind an imam who offers the prayer in full to shorten his prayer, i.e., to pray two rak’ahs with the imam, then when the imam stands up (for the third rak’ah) to say the salaam and leave?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.When the traveller prays behind a non-traveller, he has to offer the prayer in full, whether he catches up with the entire prayer or just one rak’ah, or less. Al-Athram said: I asked Abu ‘Abd-Allaah (i.e., Imam Ahmad) about the traveller: should he join in the tashahhud of residents? He said: He should pray four rak’ahs. That was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar, Ibn ‘Abbaas and a number of the Taabi’een, and was also the view of al-Shaafa’i and Abu Haneefah. 
The evidence for that is: 
1 – The words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “The imam is appointed to be followed, so do not differ from him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 722; Muslim, 4141. 
2 – The report narrated by Ahmad from Ibn ‘Abbaas, that it was said to him: “Why does the traveller pray two rak’ahs when he is alone and four when he follows an imam who is a resident (non-traveller)?” He said: “That is the Sunnah” – meaning that it is the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 571. 
3 – This is what ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) did. Naafi’ said: When Ibn ‘Umar prayed with the imam he would pray four rak’ahs and when he prayed on his own he would pray two. Narrated by Muslim. 
And Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
If the traveller prays with an imam then he has to offer the prayer in full, because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “The imam is appointed to be followed.” And because the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) used to pray behind the caliph ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan during Hajj in Mina, and he used to lead them in praying four rak’ahs so they offered four rak’ahs with him.  
Similarly if the traveller joins the prayer when the imam is offering the last two rak’ahs, after the imam says the salaam he has to stand up and complete his prayer, making it four rak’ahs, because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Whatever you catch up with, pray, what whatever you miss, complete it.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 635; Muslim, 603. In this case the person’s prayer is connected to the imam, so he has to follow the imam even with regard to whatever he missed of the prayer. 
If a person used to pray two rak’ahs behind a non-travelling imam in the past, then he has to repeat the four-rak’ah prayers in which he did that. He does not have to offer them all in one go. He should try to work out the number of prayers involved and repeat them.
