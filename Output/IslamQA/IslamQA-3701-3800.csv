3704,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3704,The      problem of forgetting Qur’aan,"When I was a youngster I was sent to a Boarding School and
did hifz for a while. I left the hifz classes after completing four paras (juz). This was due to the fact that I could not manage school & hifz at the same time. I was 12-13 years old at the time and not baaligh yet.
Is it a sin that I have now, almost 20 years later, forgotten the 4 paras (juz)? People have said it is a very great sin and that I should learn and memorize it again? 
I am confused. Please help!",,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly forgetfulness is something that is natural in man, and man is only called insaan because of his forgetfulness (nasiy). Usually this varies from one person to another, according to the differences in the strength of the memory that Allaah has created in His slaves.
 The Qur’aan “escapes” from the heart if the Muslim does not constantly and regularly review what he has memorized of it.
 The reason for this may be that it is a test of people’s hearts, to show the difference between the one whose heart is attached to the Qur’aan and regularly recites it, and the one whose heart is attached to it only whilst memorizing it, then he loses interest and forgets it.
 The reason may also be to give the Muslim a stronger motive to recite the Qur’aan more frequently so as to attain the immense reward for every letter that he recites. If it were the case that he could learn it and never forget it, he would not need to read it frequently and then he would miss out on the reward for reciting and reviewing it regularly. Fear of forgetting it will make you keen to recite it so as to gain more reward with your Lord. For every letter you recite you will have one hasanah, and the reward for one hasanah is ten like it.
 The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) urged us to read Qur’aan regularly lest we forget it. He warned us against being negligent in this regard, as was stated in numerous ahaadeeth, including the following:
 1-The hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The likeness of the one who memorizes the Qur’aan is that of the owner of a hobbled camel. If he tends to it regularly, he will keep it, but if he lets it go, he will lose it.” (al-Bukhaari, 5031).
 It is well known that if a camel escapes and runs away, it cannot be recaptured except with a lot of stress and difficulty. Similarly, if the person who memorizes Qur’aan does not regularly review what he has memorized, he will lose it and will require a great deal of effort to get it back.
 * Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said in al-Fath (9/79), in his commentary on this hadeeth: so long as one constantly reviews it, what one has memorized will remain, as is the case with a camel, if it remains hobbled, you will keep it. The camel was singled out here because it is the most likely of domesticated animals to run away, and if it does run away, recapturing it is very difficult.
 2 – Muslim narrated in his Saheeh (no. 790 and 791) from Abu Moosa (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Read this Qur’aan regularly for, by the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, it is more likely to escape than a hobbled camel.”
 3 – Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “It is not right for any one of you to say, ‘I have forgotten such and such.’ On the contrary, he has been made to forget. Try to review the Qur’aan, for it is more likely to escape from men’s hearts than camels.” (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 5032).
 Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath (9/81): Ibn Battaal said, This hadeeth is in accordance with the two aayahs (interpretation of the meanings):
‘Verily, We shall send down to you a weighty Word’ [al-Muzzammil 73:5]
and
‘And We have indeed made the Qur’ân easy to understand and remember’ [al-Qamar 54:17]
 So whoever strives to memorize it and recite it regularly, it will be made easy for him, and whoever turns away from it, will lose it.
 This is what encourages us to constantly review what we have memorized and to keep on reciting it, lest we forget it. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave this example because it is the best way to explain what he meant. He also confirmed it with his oath ‘by the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad’, to affirm the importance of constantly reciting the Qur’aan and reviewing what one has learned.
 3 – With regard to the report that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The sins of my ummah were shown to me and there is no sin greater than that of a man who was given or was helped to memorize a soorah or an aayah of the Qur’aan and then he forgot it.” This is a weak (da’eef) hadeeth which was classed as such by al-Bukhaari and al-Tirmidhi. See Takhreej Mishkaat al-Masaabeeh by al-Albaani, no. 720.
 Imaam Ibn al-Munaadi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Mutashaabih al-Qur’aan (p. 52):
 The Salaf were always afraid of forgetting Qur’aan after they had memorized it, because this was a shortcoming.
 Al-Suyooti said in al-Itqaan (1/106):
 Forgetting it is a major sin, as was stated by al-Nawawi in al-Rawdah and others, because of the hadeeth “I was shown the sins of my ummah…”
 One of the best ways to help oneself to remember what one has memorized and to make it firmly-entrenched is to recite it in one’s salaah, especially in Qiyaam al-Layl. The Salaf used to recite it during the day and when praying Qiyaam al-Layl.
 If you strive hard to review the Qur’aan regularly, there will be no sin on you even if you do forget some of it. The blame is on those who neglect it and fail to review it and read it regularly. We ask Allaah to forgive us.
 O Allaah, make the Qur’aan the life of my heart, the light of my breast, a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety. O Allaah, teach us from it that which we do not know and remind us from it of that which we have forgotten, for You are the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Then she got pregnant and gave birth in the following Ramadaan. Is it permissible for her to give charity instead of fasting?,,,"Praise be to Allah.What this woman has to do is to fast and make up the days she has missed, even if it is after the second Ramadaan, because she had an excuse not to make up the days she had missed between the first Ramadaan and the second. I wonder whether it will be too difficult for her to fast day after day in the winter even though she is still breastfeeding, but probably Allaah will give her the strength to make up the second Ramadaan. If she is not able to do that then it is OK for her to delay making it up until the second Ramadaan.",Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn U'themeen

    al-Masjid al-Haraam in Makkah","A patron at our library has asked for the
      architecture and history of the Great Mosque in Mecca known as Masjid Al Haram.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Al-Masjid al-Haraam (the Sacred Mosque) is situated in Makkah, a city
    in the Arabian Peninsula 330 meters above sea-level. The history of the mosque goes back
    to its founding at the time of Ibraaheem (Abraham) and his son Ismaa’eel (Ishmael),
    peace be upon them both. Makkah is the place where the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad 
 (peace
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was born and where the Revelation began, and from
    which the light of Islam spread. Al-Masjid al-Haraam is located here. This is the first
    mosque that was built for people on earth, as Allaah says in the Qur’aan
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, the first House (of worship) appointed for mankind was
    that at Bakkah (Makkah), full of blessing, and a guidance for al-‘aalameen (mankind
    and jinns).” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:96].  
It was reported in Saheeh Muslim that Abu Dharr said: “I
    asked the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about the first
    mosque to be built for people on earth. He said, ‘Al-Masjid al-Haraam.’ I asked,
    ‘Then which?’ He said, ‘Al-Masjid al-Aqsaa [The Furthest Mosque, in
    Jerusalem].’ I asked, ‘How long between them?’ He said, ‘Forty
    years.’” 
The Ka’bah – which is the direction of prayer for all Muslims
    throughout the world – is situated roughly in the middle of al-Masjid al-Haraam. It
    is a 15-meter high stone structure more or less in the shape of a cube. It was built by
    Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) on the command of Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the
    meaning): 
“And (remember) when We showed Ibraaheem the site of the
    (Sacred) House (the Ka’bah at Makkah) (saying): ‘Associate not anything (in
    worship) with Me, and sanctify My House for those who circumambulate it, and those who bow
    and make prostration.” [al-Hajj 22:26] 
The word “bawwa’naa” [translated here as “We
    showed”] means “He guided him and gave him permission to build it.” (Tafseer
    Ibn Katheer). 
    Allaah also says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) when Ibraaheem and (his son) Ismaa’eel
    were raising the foundations of the House (the Ka’bah at Makkah)…”
    [al-Baqarah 2:127] 
Wahb ibn Munbih said: “… It was built by Ibraaheem, then
    [rebuilt] by the Amalekites, then by Jurham, then by Qusayy ibn Kilaab. Its rebuilding by
    Quraysh is well known… They began to rebuild it with the stones of the valley, which
    Quraysh carried on their shoulders, and they built it up, 20 cubits high… Between the
    rebuilding of the Ka’bah and the beginning of the Revelation there were five years,
    and between the rebuilding and the Hijrah there were fifteen years. ‘Abd al-Razzaaq
    reported from Mu’ammar from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Uthmaan from
    Abu’l-Tufayl, and from Mu’ammar from al-Zuhri: ‘They were building it and
    when they reached al-Rukn, Quraysh argued about which tribe should lift it up. Then they
    said, “Let us ask the first person who comes from this direction to judge between
    us.” They agreed on that, then the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) came to them, and he was a young man wearing a spotted sash. They
    asked him to judge between them, and he told them to place al-Rukn on a piece of cloth,
    then he told the chief of every tribe to hold the edge of the cloth, then he climbed up
    and they lifted al-Rukn up to him, and he himself 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him) put it into its place.” (Taareekh Makkah by al-Azraqi, 1/161-164) 
    Muslim (2374) reported that ‘Aa’ishah said:
    “I asked the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about
    al-Jadr [the wall] and whether it was part of the House [the Ka’bah]. He said,
    ‘Yes.’ I asked, ‘So why is it not incorporated into the House?’ He
    said, ‘Your people ran out of money.’ I asked, ‘What about the door? Why is
    it high up?’ He said, ‘Your people did that so they could let in whomever they
    wanted and keep out whomever they wanted. If it were not for the fact that your people are
    still new [in Islam] and too close to their Jaahiliyyah, and I am afraid that they would
    resent it, I would think of incorporating al-Jadr into the House and bringing the door
    down to ground level.’” 
Before Islam (in the year in which the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) was born), the Ka’bah was subjected to an attack by the Ethiopian
    Abrahah, who had built al-Qulays, a church to which he wanted the Arabs to make their
    pilgrimage. He set out with his army, with whom was the elephant, and when they reached
    Makkah, Allaah sent flocks of birds against them; each bird was carrying three stones like
    chickpeas or lentils, one in its beak and two in its claws. Every man who was struck by a
    stone was killed, so the army was destroyed, by the command of Allaah. 
Allaah has mentioned this incident in His Book, where He says
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the Owners of the
    Elephant? Did He not make their plot go astray?
And sent against them birds, in flocks, 
Striking them with stones of Sijjeel,
And made them like an empty field of slaks (in which the corn has been
    eaten up by cattle).” [al-Feel 105:1-5]
(See al-Seerah al-Nabawiyyah by Ibn Hishaam,
    1/44-58). 
There was no fence or wall around the Ka’bah until
    it became necessary. Yaaqoot al-Hamawi said in Mu’jam al-Buldaan (5/146):
    “The first one to build a wall around the Ka’bah was ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab
    (may Allaah be pleased with him); there was no wall around it during the time of the
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or Abu Bakr. [The wall was built]
    because people were building their houses too close to the Ka’bah and making the
    space around it too small for people. ‘Umar said: ‘The Ka’bah is the House
    of Allaah, and a house needs a courtyard. You have encroached on its space, it has not
    encroached on yours.’ So he bought those houses, demolished them and added that space
    to the space around the Ka’bah. He also destroyed the houses of people in the
    vicinity of the Ka’bah who had refused to sell, and kept the money aside for them
    until they came and took it later on. He built a wall around the mosque, lower than the
    height of a man, and lamps were placed on it. When ‘Uthmaan was khaleefah, he bought
    more houses that were more expensive… It was said that ‘Uthmaan was the first
    one to build porticos around it … When Ibn al-Zubayr was in power, he improved its
    appearance, although he did not increase its size, by adding marble pillars, extra doors
    and other improvements. When ‘Abd al-Malik ibn Marwaan was khaleefah, he added to the
    wall of the mosque, and brought columns from Egypt by sea to Jeddah, which were carried
    from Jeddah to Makkah on wheels. Al-Hajjaaj ibn Yoosuf commanded that the Ka’bah
    should be covered in drapes (al-kiswah) and when al-Waleed ibn ‘Abd al-Malik was
    khaleefah, he added to the adornment of the kiswah and spent money on improvements to the
    drainage spout and roof… When al-Mansoor and his son al-Mahdi were khaleefahs, they
    added more adornments to the mosque and improved its appearance.” 
There are also other religious monuments in the Mosque, such as Maqaam
    Ibraaheem (the Station of Ibraaheem), which is the rock on which Ibraaheem (peace be upon
    him) stood whilst he was building the Ka’bah. There is also the Well of Zamzam, which
    is a spring of water brought forth by Allaah for Haajar and her child Ismaa’eel
    (peace be upon him) when he got thirsty. We should not forget either the Black Stone and
    al-Rukn al-Yamaani, which are two of the precious stones of Paradise. Al-Tirmidhi and
    Ahmad reported that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr said: “I heard the Messenger of
    Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saying that the Rukn and the Maqaam
    are two of the precious stones of Paradise, whose light has been extinguished by Allaah.
    If He had not extinguished their light, it would illuminate everything between the East
    and the West.” (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 804). 
    Near the Mosque are the two hills of al-Safa and
    al-Marwah. One of the unique features of the Mosque is that it is the only mosque in the
    world to which people come on pilgrimage (Hajj). Allaah says (interpretation of the
    meaning): 
“Verily! Al-Safa and al-Marwah are of the Symbols of Allaah. So
    it is not a sin on him who performs Hajj or ‘Umrah (pilgrimage) of the House to
    perform the going (tawaaf) between them. And whoever does good voluntarily, then verily,
    Allaah is All-Recognizer, All-Knower.” [al-Baqarah 2:158] 
Another of its unique features is that Allaah has made it safe, and
    one prayer in it is equal to a hundred thousand prayers elsewhere. Allaah says
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) when We made the House a place of resort for
    mankind and a place of safety. And take you (people) the Maqaam (place) of Ibraaheem as a
    place of prayer, and We commanded Ibraaheem and Ismaa’eel that they should purify My
    House for those who are circumabulating it, or staying (I’tikaaf), or bowing or
    prostrating themselves.” [al-Baqarah 2:125] 
“In it are manifest signs (for example); the maqaam (place) of
    Ibraaheem; whoever enters it, he attains security. And Hajj to the House is a duty that
    mankind owes to Allaah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance,
    provision and residence); and whoever disbelieves [i.e., denies Hajj, then he is a
    disbeliever of Allaah], then Allaah stands not in need of any of the ‘aalameen
    (mankind and jinns).” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:97]
(See Akhbaar Makkah by al-Azraqi and Akhbaar Makkah
    by al-Faakihi).

3749,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3749,Ways to Help Oneself Pray Qiyam al-Layl,What are some ways that help to pray Qiyam Allayl or tahajjud (late night voluntary prayers)?,,,"Praise be to Allah.There are many things that one can do to help oneself pray qiyam al-layl, among which are the following:
1 Being sincere towards Allah, as He has commanded us to be sincere towards Him and none other in our deeds. He tells us (interpretation of the meaning): And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, and worship none but Him Alone [al-Bayyinah 98:5]. The more sincere a person is towards Allah, the more he will be guided and helped to obey Allah and draw closer to Him. Ubayy ibn Kab (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Give glad tidings to this ummah (nation/community)of splendour, religion, high rank, victory and prevalence on earth. Whoever does the deeds of the Hereafter to gain some worldly benefit, will have no share of the Hereafter. (Reported by Ahmad. Saheeh al-Jaami, 2825). Mutarraf ibn Abd-Allah ibn al-Shakheer said: The goodness of a deed is related to the goodness of the heart, and the goodness of the heart is related to the goodness of the intention. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The degree to which a person is helped and aided by Allah depends on the degree of his intention, drive, aim and hopes. Help from Allah comes to people in proportion to their drive, intention, hopes and fears, and failure comes to them in like manner.
Therefore the salaf (pious predecessors) were very keen to conceal their acts of worship such as qiyam al-layl. A man asked Tameem ibn Aws al-Daari (may Allah be pleased with him), How do you pray at night? He got very angry and said, By Allah, one rakah that I pray in secret in the small hours of the night is more beloved to me than praying the whole night long and then telling people about it. Ayyoob al-Sakhtiyaani used to spend the entire night in prayer, then when dawn approached, he would go back to bed and lie down, and when dawn came, he would raise his voice as if he had just woken up.
2 The person who wants to pray qiyam al-layl should realize that Allah is calling him to qiyam. When the slave realizes that his Master, Who has no need of peoples worship, is calling him to do this, he will respond. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): O you wrapped in your garments (i.e., Prophet Muhammad)! Stand (to pray) all night, except a little. Half of it, or a little less than that, or a little more; and recite the Quraan (aloud) in a slow, (pleasant tone and) style. [al-Muzzammil 73:1-4].
Sad ibn Hishaam ibn Aamir said to Aaishah (may Allah be pleased with her): Tell me about how the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed qiyam. She said: Have you not read Yaa ayyuhal-muzzammil (O you wrapped in your garments!)? He said, Of course. She said: Allah, may He be exalted and glorified, made qiyaam obligatory at the beginning of this soorah, so the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions prayed qiyaam for a year, and Allah withheld the end of this soorah for twelve months, until He revealed something at the end of this soorah to make things easier, so qiyaam al-layl became voluntary after it had been obligatory. (Reported by Muslim).
3 Knowing the virtues of qiyam al-layl. Whoever knows the virtues of this act of worship will be keen to talk to Allah, may He be exalted, and to stand before Him at that time. Among the reports that describe the virtues of this act of worship is the hadeeth (narration)of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The best of prayers after the prescribed prayers is prayer in the depths of the night, and the best of fasting after the month of Ramadaan is fasting the month of Allah, Muharram. (reported by Muslim).
Abd-Allah ibn Amr (may Allah be pleased with them both) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The most beloved of prayer to Allah is the prayer of Dawood, and the most beloved of fasts to Allah is the fast of Dawood. He used to sleep for half of the night, then get up and pray for a third of the night, then sleep for a sixth of the night, and he used to fast every other day. (Agreed upon).
Amr ibn Absah reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The closest that the Lord is to His slave is in the later part of the night, so if you can be one of those who remember Allah at that time, then do so. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi and al-Nisaa'i).
According to a hadeeth narrated by Ibn Masood (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Our Lord admires two men: a man who leaves his mattress and cover, and slips away from his wife and lover, to go and pray. Allah says, O My angels, look at My slave. He has left his mattress and cover and slipped away from his lover and wife to pray, out of hope for what is with Me and out of fear of what is with Me. (Reported by Ahmad. It is a hasan (sound) report. Saheeh al-Targheeb, 258).
Qiyam al-Layl expels forgetfulness from the heart, as is stated in the hadeeth narrated by Abd-Allah ibn Amr ibn al-Aas (may Allah be pleased with them both), in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever recites ten aayaat (verses)in qiyaam will not be recorded as one of the forgetful. Whoever recites a hundred aayaat in qiyaam will be recorded as one of the devout , and whoever prays a thousand aayaat in qiyaam will be recorded as one of the muqantareen (those who pile up good deeds). (Reported by Abu Dawood and Ibn Hibbaan. It is a hasan report. Saheeh al-Targheeb, 635).
Yahyaa ibn Muaadh said: The medicine of the heart is five things: reading Quraan and pondering the meaning, having an empty stomach, praying at night (qiyam al-layl), beseeching Allah at the time of suhoor, and keeping company with righteous people.
4 Studying how the salaf and righteous people practised qiyam al-layl and adhered to it. The salaf used to enjoy qiyam al-layl and rejoice greatly in doing it. Abd-Allah ibn Wahb said: Every type of pleasure is enjoyed only once, except for acts of worship, which are enjoyed three times: when you do it, when you remember it, and when you are given the reward for it.
Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir said: There is nothing left of the joys of this life except three: qiyam al-layl, meeting ones brothers in faith, and praying in congregation.
Thaabit al-Banaani said: There is nothing I enjoy more than qiyam al-layl.
Yazeed al-Riqaashi said: A lot of tahajjud brings delight to the worshippers, and a lot of thirst (i.e., fasting), brings joy when they meet Allah.
Mukhallad ibn Husayn said: I never woke up at night except I saw Ibraaheem ibn Adham remembering Allah and praying, and this made me depressed, so I consoled myself with this aayah (interpretation of the meaning): That is the Grace of Allah which He bestows on whom He pleases. And Allah is the Owner of Great Bounty [al-Hadeed 57:21].
Abu Aasim al-Nabeel said: Abu Haneefah used to be called al-Watad (pole or pillar) because he prayed so much.
Al-Qaasim ibn Maeen said: Abu Haneefah spent an entire night in qiyam reciting this aayah (interpretation of the meaning): Nay, but the Hour is their appointed time (for their full recompense), and the Hour will be more grievous and more bitter [al-Qamar 54:46], repeating it and weeping, beseeching Allah until morning came.
Ibraaheem ibn Shammaas said: I used to see Ahmad ibn Hanbal staying up at night to pray when he was a young man.
Abu Bakr al-Marwadhi said: I was with Imaam Ahmad for nearly four months in the army, and he never stopped praying qiyam at night or reading Quraan during the day, and I never knew when he completed the Quraan, because he kept that secret.
Imaam al-Bukhaari used to pray qiyam and tahajjud at night until the time of suhoor, and he would read between a half and a third of the Quraan, and complete it at suhoor every third night.
Al-Allaamah Ibn Abd al-Haadi said, describing the qiyam of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah: At night he would keep away from people, and spend that time only with his Lord, beseeching Him continually and reciting Quraan, repeating different kinds of acts of worship by night and by day. When he began to pray, his body would start to tremble, leaning to the left and right.
Ibn Rajab said concerning his shaykh Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim: He was a man of worship, tahajjud and lengthy prayers. I have never seen his equal in worship and knowledge of the Quraan, hadeeth and principles of faith.
Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said, describing his shaykh al-Haafiz al-Iraaqi: I stayed with him, and I never saw him forsake qiyam al-layl: it was like a habit for him.
5 Sleeping on ones right side. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught his ummah (followers)to sleep on their right sides, as is reported in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When any one of you goes to bed, let him clear his bed by hitting it with his garment, for he does not know what may have come onto it. Then let him lie down on his right side, then let him say, Bismika Rabbi wadatu janbi wa bika arfauhu. In amsakta nafsi farhamhaa wa in arsaltahaa fahfazhaa bimaa tahfazu bihi ibaadaka al-saaliheen (In Your Name, my Lord, I lay myself down and I get up again. If You take my soul, then have mercy on it, and if You send it back to me, then protect it with that with which You protect Your righteous slaves). (Agreed upon).
Al-Baraa ibn Aazib (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When you want to go to bed, do wudoo as for prayer, then lie down on your right side. (Agreed upon)
Hafsah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went to bed, he would put his right hand under his right cheek. (Reported by al-Tabaraani, Saheeh al-Jaami, 4523).
Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: There is a reason for his lying on his right side, which is that the heart is located on the left, so if a person lays on his left side, he will sleep too deeply, because the hearts position will be too comfortable, but if he sleeps on his right side, he will not be too settled, so he wont sleep deeply.
6 Sleeping in a state of tahaarah (purity). We have already quoted the hadeeth of al-Baraa ibn Aazib (may Allah be pleased with him), in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, When you go to bed, do wudoo as if for prayer. (Agreed upon).
Muaad ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: There is no Muslim who goes to sleep remembering Allah and in a state of purity, and when he turns over he asks Allah for good in this world and the next, but it will be given to him. (Reported by Abu Dawood and Ahmad. Saheeh al-Jaami, 5754).
Ibn Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with them both) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Purify these bodies and Allah will purify you, for there is no slave who goes to sleep in a state of purity but an angel spends the night with him, and every time he turns over, [the angel] says, O Allah, forgive Your slave, for he went to bed in a state of purity. (Reported by al-Tabaraani. Al-Mundhiri said, its isnaad is jaayid. Saheeh al-Jaami, 3831).
7 Going to sleep early. Sleeping straight after Ishaa is the advice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and a good and healthy habit. One of the ahaadeeth that describe its virtues was narrated by Abu Barzah al-Aslami (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to prefer to delay Ishaa, and he did not like to sleep before it or talk after it. (Reported by al-Bukhaari).
Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar reported that al-Qaadi Ayaad said, concerning the phrase He did not like to sleep before it: Because that could lead to one praying it too late, or delaying it until after the preferred time, and talking after it could lead to one sleeping before Fajr and missing it, or missing qiyam al-layl.
Ibn Raafi said: Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) used to wave his stick at the people when darkness fell, and would say, Get up and go, may Allah help you to pray qiyam at night!
Another matter that has to do with sleep is choosing a suitable bed, not one that is excessively luxurious or soft, because that makes a person sleep too much and become negligent, and causes laziness and carelessness. Aaishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The pillow of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on which he slept at night was made of leather stuffed with palm fibres. (Reported by Abu Dawood and Ahmad. Saheeh al-Jaami, 4714).
Ibn Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that Umar ibn al-Khattaab entered upon the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he was lying on a mat of palm fibres that had left marks on his side. Umar said, O Messenger of Allah, why do you not get something more comfortable than this? He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: What do I have to do with this world? My relationship with this world is like that of a traveller on a hot summers day, who seeks shade under a tree for an hour, then moves on. (Reported by Ahmad and al-Haakim. Saheeh al-Jaami, 5545).
Ali ibn Bakkaar (may Allah have mercy on him) used to have a slave-woman who would spread out his bed for him, and he would touch it with his hand and say: By Allah, you are good, and by Allah you are cool, but by Allah I will not rest on you tonight. Then he would get up and pray qiyam until Fajr.
Also, one should not sleep too much or too deeply. Ibraaheem ibn Adham said: If you are sleeping at night, and running about during the day, and always committing sin, how can you earn the pleasure of the One Who is directing your affairs?
8 Having the habit of reciting adhkaar (words of remembrance of Allah) prescribed by shareeah (Islamic law) before going to sleep, because these adhkaar are like a fortress which protects a person from the Shaytaan, by the permission of Allah, and helps him to get up for qiyam. Among these adhkaar is that mentioned in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When any one of you goes to bed, let him clear his bed by hitting it with his garment, for he does not know what may have come onto it. Then let him lie down on his right side, then let him say, Bismika Rabbi wadatu janbi wa bika arfauhu. In amsakta nafsi farhamhaa wa in arsaltahaa fahfazhaa bimaa tahfazu bihi ibaadaka al-saaliheen (In Your Name, my Lord, I lay myself down and I get up again. If You take my soul, then have mercy on it, and if You send it back to me, then protect it with that with which You protect Your righteous slaves). (Agreed upon).
Aaishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went to bed each night, he would put his palms together, blow in them, and recite Qul huwa Allahu ahad, Qul aoodhu bi Rabbil-Falaq and Qul aoodhu bi Rabbil-Naas, then he would wipe as much of his body as he could with his hands, starting with his head and face, and the front of his body, doing this three times. (Agreed upon).
Ibn Masood (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever recites the last two aayahs of Soorat al-Baqarah, this will take care of him. (Agreed upon).
Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went to bed, he would say: Al-hamdu Lillaah illadhi atamanaa wa saqaanaa, wa kafaanaa fa kam mimman laa kaafeeya lahu wa laa muweeya lahu (Praise be to Allah Who has fed us and given us to drink, and Who has given us enough, for how many are there who have no-one to suffice them or give them refuge). (Reported by Muslim).
According to the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah in which he tells the story of how he captured the Shaytaan, the Shaytaan said to him: When you go to bed, recite Aayat al-Kursi, Allah! None has the right to be worshipped but He, the Ever-Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists [al-Baqarah 2:255 interpretation of the meaning] until the end of it, because it will bring Allahs protection for you, and no shaytaan (devil) will approach you until morning comes. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) mentioned this to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he said, He spoke the truth even though he is a liar. (Agreed upon).
Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that when the Prophets daughter Faatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) came to him and asked him for a servant, he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to her and Ali: Shall I not teach you something that will be better for you than a servant? When you go to bed, say Subhaan Allah thirty-three times, al-hamdu Lillaah thirty-three times, and Allahu akbar thirty-four times. This is better for you than a servant. (Agreed upon).
Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Recite Qul yaa ayyuhal-kaafiroon when you go to sleep, for it is a renunciation of shirk. (polytheism) (Reported by al-Bayhaqi. Saheeh al-Jaami, 1172).
Hafsah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went to bed, he would put his right hand under his right cheek and say: Rabbi qinee adhaabaka yawma tabathu ibaadaka (My Lord, save me from Your punishment on the Day when You resurrect Your slaves). (Reported by Abu Dawood, Saheeh al-Jaami, 4532).
Al-Baraa ibn Aazib (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When you go to bed, do wudoo as if for prayer, then lie down on your right side, then say: Allahummah aslamtu nafsi ilayk, wa wajahtu wajhi ilayk, wa fawwadtu amri ilayk, wa aljatu zahri ilayk, raghbatan wa rahbatan ilayk, laa maljaa wa laa manjaa minka illa ilayk. Aamantu bi kitaabik alladhi anzalt, wa bi nabiyyik alladhi arsalt (O Allah, I submit myself to You, I turn my face to You, I delegate my affairs to You and I rely totally on You, out of fear and hope of You. There is no refuge or sanctuary from You except in You. I believe in Your Book which You have revealed and in Your Prophet whom You have sent). Then if you die, you will have died on the fitrah, (natural state) , so make these the last words you speak.” (Agreed upon).
Similarly, the Muslim should have the habit of reciting adhkaar prescribed by shareeah when waking up, such as that reported by Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When any one of you wakes up, he should say: Al-hamdu Lillaah illadhi radda alayya roohi, wa aafaani fi jasadi wa adhina li bi dhikrihi (Praise be to Allah Who has restored my soul, given health to my body, and allowed me to remember Him). (Reported by al-Tirmidhi and al-Nisaa'i, Saheeh al-Jaami, 326).
Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever turns over at night and says Laa ilaaha ill-Allah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, lahul-mulk wa lahul-hamd wa huwa al kulli shayin qadeer. Al-hamdulillahi, subhaan Allah wa laa illaaha ill-Allah wa Allahu akbar wa laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah (There is no god but Allah Alone, with no partner or associate. His is the Dominion and the Praise, and He is Able to do all things. Praise be to Allah, glory be to Allah. There is no god except Allah, Allah is Most Great and there is no strength and no power except in Allah), then says, Allahumma ghfir li (O Allah, forgive me), or some other duaa, it will be answered, and if he does wudoo and then prays, his prayer will be accepted. (Reported by al-Bukhaari)
Imaam Ibn Battaal said: Allah has promised through His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that whoever wakes up from his sleep pronouncing words of Tawheed, submitting to His sovereignty, recognizing His blessings by praising Him, exalting Him above that which does not befit Him by glorifying Him (saying Subhaan Allah), submitting to Him by magnifying Him (saying Allahu akbar) and admitting ones utter dependence upon His help, then if he makes duaa it will be answered, and if he prays his prayer will be accepted. Everyone who hears this hadeeth should apply it and make the most of it, and make his intention sincerely for his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted.
Al-Baraa ibn Aazib (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) woke up, he would say: Al-hamdu Lillaah illadhi ahyaanaa bada maa amaatanaa wa ilayhi al-nushoor (Praise be to Allah Who has brought us back to life after having caused us to die, and unto Him is the resurrection). (Reported by Muslim).
Ibn Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with them both) reported that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) woke up he would wipe the sleep from his face with his hand, then look at the sky and recite the final ten aayaat of Soorat Aal Imran: Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth [Aal Imraan 3:190 interpretation of the meaning]. (Reported by Muslim)
Imaam al-Nawawi said: This indicates that it is mustahabb (recommended) to wipe away the traces of sleep from ones face, and to recite these aayaat when getting up from sleep.
9 Being keen to take a nap or siesta during the day, whether before zuhr or after. Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Take a nap, for the shayaateen do not take naps. (Reported by al-Tabaraani. Al-Saheehah, 2647).
Ishaaq ibn Abd-Allah said: Taking a nap is one of the deeds of good people. It revitalizes the heart and helps one to pray qiyam al-layl.
Al-Hasan al-Basri passed by a group of people in the marketplace in the middle of the day, and heard the racket they were making. He said, Do these people take a nap? It was said to him, No. He said, I think their nights must be bad.
10 Avoiding eating or drinking too much. Eating and drinking too much are two of the main obstacles that prevent people from praying qiyam al-layl. Al-Miqdaam ibn Mad Yakrib (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Man fills no vessel worse than his stomach. It is sufficient for the son of Adam to have a few mouthfuls to give him the strength he needs. If he has to fill his stomach, then let him leave one-third for food, one-third for drink and one-third for air. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Maajah. Saheeh al-Jaami, 5674).
Abu Juhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to a man who burped in his presence: Stop your burping, for the people who eat the most in this life will be the most hungry on the Day of Resurrection. (Reported by al-Haakim. Saheeh al-Jaami, 1190).
Sufyaan al-Thawri said: You should eat little, so that you will be able to pray qiyam al-layl.
Maqal ibn Habeeb saw some people eating a lot, and said, I do not think that our companions want to pray qiyam al-layl.
Wahb ibn Munabbih said: There is no son of Adam dearer to his shaytaan than the one who eats and sleeps a lot.
11 Striving against oneself to pray qiyam al-layl. This is one of the best means of helping oneself to pray qiyam, because human nature is inclined towards wrongdoing, so the one who follows his own inclinations will be led to doom and destruction. Allah has commanded us to strive against our own selves, as He says (interpretation of the meanings):
And strive hard in Allahs Cause as you ought to strive [al-Hajj 22:78]
And as for those who strive hard in Our Cause, We will surely guide them to Our Paths. And verily, Allah is with the muhsinoon (good-doers). [al-Ankaboot 29:69]
Their sides forsake their beds, to invoke their Lord in fear and hope, and they spend (charity in Allahs Cause) out of what We have bestowed on them [al-Sajdah 32:16]
Fadaalah ibn Ubayd (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The mujaahid (warrior) is the one who strives against his own self for the sake of Allah. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Hibbaan. Al-Saheehah, 549).
According to the hadeeth of Uqbah ibn Aamir (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When a man from my ummah gets up to pray at night, striving against his own self to get up and purify himself, there are knots on him. When he washes his hands in wudoo, one knot is undone. When he washes his face, another knot is undone. When he wipes his head another knot is undone. When he washes his feet, another knot is undone. Then Allah says to those who are veiled (in the Unseen): Look at this slave of Mine, he is striving against his own self and asking of Me. Whatever My slave asks of Me shall be his. (Reported by Ahmad and Ibn Hibaan. Saheeh al-Targheeb, 627).
Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir said: I struggled against my own self for forty years until it became right. Thaabit al-Banaani said: I struggled for twenty years to make myself pray qiyam al-layl, and I enjoyed it (qiyam al-layl) for twenty years. Umar ibn Abd al-Azeez said: The best of deeds are those which we force ourselves to do. Abd-Allah ibn al-Mubaarak said: The souls of righteous people in the past used to push them to do good deeds, but our souls do not do what we want them to do except by force, so we have to force them. Qutaadah said: O son of Adam, if you do not want to do any good except when you have the energy for it, then your nature is more inclined towards boredom and laziness. The true believer is the one who pushes himself.
12 Avoiding sin. If the Muslim wants to be one of those who earn the honour of speaking to Allah in the depths of the night, let him beware of sin, for the one who is contaminated with the stain of sin will not be helped to pray qiyaam al-layl. A man said to Ibraaheem ibn Adham, I cannot pray qiyam al-layl, so tell me the cure for this. He said, Do not commit sin during the day, and He will help you to stand before Him at night, for your standing before Him at night is one of the greatest honours, and the sinner does not deserve that honour.
A man said to al-Hasan al-Basri: O Abu Saeed, I sleep in good health, and I love to pray qiyam al-layl, and I prepare water with which to purify myself, so why can I not get up? Al-Hasan said: Your sins are restricting you. He said, may Allah have mercy on him, The slave who commits a sin will be denied the opportunity to pray qiyam at night and to fast during the day.
Al-Fudayl ibn Ayaad said: If you cannot pray qiyam al-layl, or fast during the day, know that you are indeed deprived and restricted, chained by your sins.
13 Checking oneself and rebuking oneself for not praying qiyam al-layl. Checking oneself is one of the signs of the righteous and truthful. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): O you who believe! Fear Allah and keep your duty to Him. And let every person look to what he has sent forth for the morrow, and fear Allah. Verily, Allah is All-Aware of what you do. [al-Hashr 59:18].
Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim said: If the slave is responsible and accountable for everything, even his hearing, sight and innermost thoughts, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning), Verily, the hearing, and the sight, and the heart of each of you will be questioned by Allah [al-Isra 17:36], then he should check on himself before he is brought to account.
Qiyam al-layl is an act of worship that connects the heart to Allah, may He be exalted, and enables it to overcome the temptations of life and to strive against ones own self, at the time when voices are stilled, eyes are closed in sleep, and sleepers are tossing and turning in their beds. Therefore qiyam al-layl is one of the measures of sincere determination and one of the qualities of those who have great ambitions. Allah has praised them and distinguished them from others in the Quraan, where He says (interpretation of the meaning): Is one who is obedient to Allah, prostrating himself or standing (in prayer) during the hours of the night, fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the Mercy of his Lord (like one who disbelieves)? Say: Are those who know equal to those who know not? It is only men of understanding who will remember. [al-Zumar 39:9]
Qiyam al-layl is sunnah muakkadah (confirmed Sunnah), which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) urged us to do when he said, You should pray qiyam al-layl, for it is the habit of the righteous people who came before you, and it will bring you closer to your Lord, expiate for bad deeds, prevent sin, and expel disease from the body. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi and Ahmad).
According to a hadeeth, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The best of prayers after the prescribed prayers is qiyam al-layl. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) always had the habit of praying qiyam al-layl, and never gave it up, whether he was travelling or staying at home. Even though he, among all the sons of Adam, would be the one to have all his past and future sins forgiven, he prayed qiyaam al-layl until his feet became swollen, and when he was asked about that, he said, Should I not be a grateful slave? (Agreed upon).
This is how the noble salaf were, may Allah have mercy upon them. Abul-Darda (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Pray two rakahs in the darkness of the night for the darkness of the grave. Ahmad ibn Harb said: I am astonished at people who know that the delights of Paradise lie above them and the horrors of Hell lie beneath them. How can they sleep in between them?
When Umar ibn Dharr saw that night had come, he would say: Night has come, and night has dignity, and Allah is most deserving of reverence.
For this reason, al-Fudayl ibn Ayaad said: I met some people who feel ashamed before Allah to sleep for too long in the depths of the night. Such a person may be resting on his side, and when he moves, he says to himself, This is not your right. Get up and take your share of the Hereafter.
Al-Hasan said: We do not know of any deed more difficult than the struggle to stay up at night or to spend money. It was said to him, Why do the mutahajjadeen (those who pray Tahajjud at night) have the most beautiful faces? He said, Because they spend time alone with the Most Merciful, so He adorns them with some of His light.
The women of the salaf also used to strive to pray qiyam al-layl with energy and determination. Where are the women of our own age when it comes to such great deeds? Urwah ibn al-Zubayr said: I came to Aaishah (may Allah be pleased with her) one day to greet her, and I found her praying and reciting the aayah (interpretation of the meaning), But Allah has been gracious to us, and has saved us from the torment of the Fire [al-Toor 52:27], repeating it and weeping. I waited for her, but I got bored of waiting, so I went to the market for some things I needed, then I came back to Aaishah, and she was still praying and reciting this aayah and weeping.
Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Jibreel said to me, Go back to Hafsah, for she fasts a lot and prays a lot at night (qiyam al-layl). (Reported by al-Haakim, Saheeh al-Jaami, 4227).
Muaadhah al-Adawiyyah, one of the righteous Taabiaat (successors of the companions of the Prophet) spent her wedding night, along with her husband Silah ibn Ashyam, praying until Fajr. When her husband and son were killed in the land of jihaad (battle), she would spend the whole night in prayer, worshipping and beseeching Allah, and she would sleep during the day. If she felt sleepy whilst she was praying at night, she would tell herself: O soul, there is plenty of sleep ahead of you.
When Habeebah al-Adawiyyah prayed Ishaa, she would stand on the roof of her house, wearing her chemise and khimaar (i.e., covered in proper Islamic dress), then she would say, O my God, the stars have come out, people have gone to sleep, and kings have closed their doors, but Your door is open. Every lover is alone with his lover, but here I am standing before You. Then she would start to pray and talk to her Lord until the time of suhoor. When the time of suhoor came, she would say, O Allah, this night is ending, the day is coming, and I wish I knew whether you have accepted this night (of worship) from me, so that I could congratulate myself, or if it has been rejected, so that I might console myself.
Amrah, the wife of Habeeb al-Ajami, prayed qiyam al-layl one night whilst her husband was asleep. When the time for suhoor came, and her husband was still asleep, she woke him up and said to him, Get up, my master, for the night has gone, the day has come and ahead of you lies a long road with little provision, and a small group of righteous people who have gone before us, and we are still here.
We ask Allah to help us to remember Him, to thank Him and to worship Him properly. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

    Takbeer in the mosque when hearing good news","Is it a bid'ah to yell ""takbeer""
    or ""tasbeeh"" everytime you have som good news in a masjid so that the
    congregation can chant in a group?",,,"Praise be to Allah.When the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon

    home because of fiqhi differences between husband and wife","My husband is a strict follower of the
      Shafi'ee madhab, while I prefer to choose the fatwa which my mind tells me is based on
      stronger daleel no matter what the origin of the school is, whenever there is a difference
      between the well-known madhabs. My husband tells me that I don't have the right to do this
      since I am not a scholar myself. Is he right?Please reply if at all possible, because there has been a lot of tension
      in my household because of this.",,,"Praise be to Allah.In order to answer this question, we must shed light on
    three things:
we must point out the importance of avoiding sectarianism in following
        any school of thought, whether it has to do with fiqh, thought or anything else. We should
        get into the habit of following the Quraan and Sunnah and letting them be our guide.

There is such a thing as the inclination to follow one of the opinions
        of the fuqaha, not on the basis of Tarjeeh (weighing and comparing evidence) but
        because of a desire to follow the easiest way or because it suits one's own desires. A
        person may find some justification for motives that he thinks are correct, and does not
        realize they are wrong until later on. Therefore one should only select or give preference
        to an opinion either by studying the matter and examining the evidence and proofs offered
        by all sides, which should be done by one who has sound knowledge, or else by following a
        scholar who is well known to be knowledgeable, religious, pious and righteous, so that one
        feels confident of his sincerity and wide knowledge.

Keeping the peace in the marital home is more important than disputing
        as to whose opinion or madhhab should prevail, so long as the issue in question is one in
        which differences of opinion are permissible and every opinion has some grounds for
        validity. At the same time, it should be pointed out to the husband, gently and calmly,
        that it is important to base ones opinions on sound evidence, and that not every
        scholarly opinion or madhhab is always correct. The scholars themselves said that their
        opinions should be discounted if they contradicted well known evidence, as
        al-Shaafai said: If my opinion contradicts a hadeeth of the Messenger of
        Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), cast it aside (lit. throw it against
        the wall).

If you and your husband are not students of shareeah with a firm
    grounding of knowledge, then you have to refer to one of the scholars and follow his
    opinions. If you agree on a scholar you can both refer to him, and if your husband chooses
    someone according to what he thinks is best and you choose someone else, there is nothing
    wrong with that. Each of you can follow his or her scholar in matters that do not affect
    the other, but in matters where the husband has authority or responsibility, the opinion
    of the scholar whom your husband is following should prevail. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

    by Imaam Ahmad, 21874, and Ibn Maajah, 2055). The meaning of the phrase
    “for no compelling reason” is anything that gives her a strong motive for
    seeking divorce. (Sharh Ibn Maajah ‘ala al-Sanadi).
    As for intercourse in bed, if the wife’s demands
    are greater than what is normal, it is not permissible for her to seek a divorce (the word
    “normal” refers to what is usual, such as once a week or once every ten days and
    so on, and people vary in their capacity in this regard). For more information, please see

Mail me if you want more information.
Please be patient with the length of my question as I believe the more I inform you the better you can answer the question.
I live in the West and I was born in a Muslim family. From my early teenage years I became active in Islam. Even from a young age I believed in Islam and I even wondered how people went to sleep without praying !!
I'm now much older and I have changed completely. My belief in Islam and even in Allah has disappeared. Basically I have become an outright hypocrite of the worst kind. I stay away from women but not pornography. I am prepared and trying to give that up and that maybe the cause of my fall but I've noticed that it's too late, as this is now a branch of the problem and not the root as the root of the problem is my belief in Allah and Islam.
Sometimes I believe I am crazy as I continuosly have erroneous thoughts about God, where I came from, Islam, right and wrong, etc.. I seem to be fighting between belief and disbelief, especially during prayer.
I have not abandoned prayer, etc, but it really does not benefit me any more. If you meet me you'll think I'm practicing from my appearance and speech, etc, I go to the mosque, I fast, but really I'm a true hypocrite whom no one knows. I cannot go on like this. 
I actually actively give Dawah aswell to non-muslims but in my heart I really disbelieve, so why am I doing this ??? But when I directly discuss Allah it hurts me due to my confusion as I have lost my belief and find it hard to fake belief at times !!!",,,"Praise be to Allah.You should know, my brother, that the most essential thing for any
        person is his commitment to Islam and his faith, and he will not be harmed by whatever he
        misses out on of worldly things if Allaah keeps his religion safe. Allaah is the King of
        kings and is the One Who moves the heart; He Alone is the One Who strengthens the heart
        and makes it steadfast. For this reason I advise you, my brother, to turn to Allaah, for
        He is a loving and merciful Lord Who is Compassionate towards His slaves. If you turn to
        Him sincerely and pray with true longing and ask Him to strengthen your faith and protect
        you from the evil of the whispers of your own soul and of the Shaytaan, then Allaah is
        Close and responds to the prayers of those who call on Him. Do not forget this important
        fact, for it is a source of relief and a way out from your problem, in sha Allaah. I would
        also like to remind you of the virtues of reading Quraan and reciting a lot of
        duaas, morning and evening, for this will have a great effect in bringing
        peace and comfort to your heart.
Avoid the things that will make you feel far away from Allaah and bring
        you closer to the Shaytaan and his whispers. One of these things is what you mention in
        your question, namely looking at pornography and so on, because if a person persists in
        sin, it piles up in his heart until it is overwhelmed with darkness and is not affected by
        any exhortation or preaching. So hasten to repent from this sin and others, and fulfil the
        conditions of repentance properly. We also advise you to avoid sitting with bad company
        and in gatherings that could increase your confusion or provoke your desires; look for
        good people and keep company with them, because a man will be on the religion of his
        friend.
It seems from your question that you are suffering from a specific
        psychological problem, either financial or social or otherwise, and this is having an
        effect on this waswaas (insinuating thoughts from Shaytaan) that you are suffering. If
        this is indeed the case, we advise you to treat this problem quickly, because this may be
        a way of dealing with what you are suffering from. We will help you as much as we can, in
        sha Allaah.
What you are going through might be a kind of depression or anxiety, for
        one reason or another. You know that Allaah has not created a disease without also
        creating the cure. It is known that there are medicines that may be of help, by the grace
        of Allaah, in treating this kind of sickness. So ask about this kind of medication from a

3781,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3781,Timing of the Morning,"If I forgot to say Adhkar as-sabah (words of remembrance for the morning) before sunrise, is it acceptable if I say them whenever I wake up?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    
    Adhkar al-sabah (supplications recited in the morning) are not connected 
    only to the time when the sun rises; in Arabic the word subh (morning) 
    applies to dawn and the first part of the day, as is stated in al-Qamoos 
    al-Muheet, 291 
    
    [a famous Arabic language dictionary – Translator]. 
    Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

    
    “… and celebrate the praises of your Lord in the evening and in the 
    morning.”

    
    [Ghafir 40:55 – Yusuf ‘Ali’s translation]

    
    Ibn Katheer said in his Tafseer  (exegesis) (4/86) that this means in 
    the early part of the day and in the early part of the night. But the best 
    time of the day for making dhikr (reciting words of remembrance) is after 
    the dawn prayer, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

    
    “… and glorify the praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun, and 
    before its setting…”

    
    [Taha 20:130]

    
    And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever 
    prays Fajr in congregation, then sits and remembers Allah (makes dhikr) 
    until the sun rises, then prays two rak’ahs (units of prayer), will have a 
    reward like that for Hajj and ‘Umrah (major and minor Pilgrimage), complete, 
    complete, complete.” (Saheeh al-Jami’, 6222).

    
    Based on the above, this is how we understand the reports narrated on this 
    topic, such as the hadeeths (narrations): 

    
    “Whoever says, in the morning and the evening, ‘Subhan Allahi wa bi 
    hamdih (Glory and praise be to Allah)’ one hundred times, will not come 
    with anything better than it on the Day of Resurrection, except for one who 
    does likewise or does more.” 
    
    (Reported by Muslim, 2692).

    
    “Allahumma bika asbahna wa bika amsayna wa bika nahya wa bika namoot wa 
    ilayka al-nushoor (O Allah, by Your blessings we reach the morning, by 
    Your blessings we reach the evening, by Your blessings we live, by Your 
    blessings we die, and unto You is the Resurrection).” 
    
    (Reported by Abu Dawood in al-Sunan, no. (5068); al-Nasai 
    in al-Sunan al-Kubra (9836). Al-Albani said it is a saheeh hadeeth/authentic 
    narration).

    
    Therefore, you can say adhkar al-sabah when you wake up from sleeping, 
    because it is still the time of subh (morning). And Allah is the Source of 
    strength.

    
    Note: 
    Muslim reported in his Saheeh (no. 747) that the Prophet (peace and 
    blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever sleeps without doing his 
    regular dhikr or part of it, then recites it during the time between the 
    Fajr prayer and Zuhr prayer, it will be recorded as if he had recited it at 
    night.”

    
    In Sharh Muslim (6/27), al-Nawawi said: 

    
    “This indicates that it is mustahabb (liked, preferred), to recite awrad (dhikr, 
    supplications) regularly, and that if one misses it, one can make it up 
    later.”

    
    In ‘Awn al-Ma’bood (4/198) it says: “This hadeeth indicates that it 
    is permissible to recite wird regularly at night, and that it is 
    permissible to make it up if one misses it because of sleeping or any other 
    reason. It also indicates that the one who does this between the Fajr prayer 
    and Zuhr prayer is like the one who does it at night, so it is mustahabb to 
    make up tahajjud if one misses it at night.”

How does it work?  And to what extent does it exist?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Human societies have known all kinds of class systems.
    In some societies there is a class of princes, a class of warriors, a class of farmers and
    a class of slaves, and based on this there is a lot of oppression, abuse and trampling on
    people’s rights. But the sharee’ah or law of Allaah does not recognize such
    systems at all. Islam gives equal rights to all, rich and poor, noble and ignoble. The
    basic principle on which people are differentiated in Islam is mentioned in the Holy
    Qur’aan, in Soorat al-Hujuraat (interpretation of the meaning):
“O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and
    made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most
    honourable of you with Allaah is that (believer) who has al-taqwa [i.e., is one of the
    muttaqoon or pious]. Verily, Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Aware”
[al-Hujuraat 49:13]
The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O
    people! Verily your Lord is One and your father [Adam] is one. An Arab is no better than a
    non-Arab, and a non-Arab is no better than an Arab; a red man is no better than a black
    man and a black man is no better than a red man – except if it is in terms of taqwa
    (piety)…” (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 22391; al-Silsilat al-Saheeh,
    2700).
    This is the principle on which society is based in
    Islam. This is the global human society which mankind is trying to attain through its
    far-fetched ideas, but is failing to do so, because they are not following the one
    straight path that will lead them there, the way to God, may He be glorified, and because
    they are not standing under the one banner that could unite them, the banner of God, may
    He be exalted.
People live on this earth connected by all kinds of relationships, all
    of which carry some weight or have some attraction in their lives… these include
    lineage, power, wealth, etc. From these stem other connections, practical, economic, etc.,
    where people have different positions and levels of status with regard to one another. So
    some people have more status than others in worldly terms… Then Islam comes and says:
    “the most honourable of you with Allaah [God] is that (believer) who has al-taqwa
    [i.e., is one of the muttaqoon or pious]” so it ignores all the values that carry
    weight in people’s lives, and replaces them all with this new value that is derived
    directly from the Revelation and is the only one that is recognized in the standards of
    God. This is piety and consciousness of God, which is manifested in the worship of God
    lone, with no partner, no son, no equal… obeying what He commands and avoiding what
    He forbids, seeking His pleasure and Paradise, and fearing His punishment and Hell-fire.

      May Allah guides us All to the right path.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We put the following question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn
    Saalih al-Uthaymeen:
One of the Sunnahs with regard to marriage is that it should be
    announced publicly, with beating on the daff or hand-drum (i.e., celebrations), so
    as to distinguish it from fornication, which usually happens in secret. If the marriage
    contract has been drawn up in accordance with all the requisite conditions, then it is
    valid even if the family does not accept it. The issue of kafaaah or
    compatibility has to do with religious commitment, as Allaah has explained in His Book. A
    Muslim man can marry a Muslim woman, or a woman of the People of the Book (Jews and
    Christians) on the condition that she is chaste, but he is not permitted to marry a
    mushrikah (polytheist woman) or a zaaniyah (woman who commits adultery or fornication). He
    should, however, try to find a woman who is strongly committed to Islam. A Muslim woman is
    not permitted to marry anyone except a Muslim man. A man of the People of the Book does
    not qualify in terms of compatibility with her, and she should look for someone who is
    known among the Muslims to be committed to Islam and of good character.
With regard to the situation described in the question, we may note the
    following points:
The husband does not have to divorce his wife if his father asks him to
        do so.

The fathers rights are great indeed, and good treatment of one's
        family is a duty. If your father is suffering from heart disease, it is better if he does
        not know about this marriage. It is unlikely that his attitude has changed because it is
        based on the class/caste system and it is not easy for seniors to change their beliefs.

You have to make sure you understand your familys current attitude
        and to what extent they are prepared to accept your marriage to this woman. Perhaps they
        have heard that she has got married, and they think that she has married someone else, so
        they want to make you feel better (by saying they would accept her because she now seems
        to be safely out of the picture). Or perhaps they have heard that she has got married to
        you and they want to hear about it from you. Once you are sure that they have changed
        their attitude for real, there is nothing to stop you asking for permission from them and
        from your father to get married. If they give you permission, then this is what you want;
        if they do not, then just stay as you are now, so that no bad consequences will come to
        them as a result of them knowing about your marriage.

As far as repeating your marriage contract is concerned, we put this
    question to the Mufti Shaykh Abd al-Azeez ibn Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz, who
    replied with the conclusion that if the first contract met all the requisite conditions,
    and there are no impediments, then it is a valid contract. It should not be repeated lest
    that open the way to playing about with it. You should strive to please your family in
    every way you can and tell them that the matter has been concluded in an appropriate
    fashion. If there is genuine cause to fear for your fathers life, then it could be
    said that repeating the contract could be done on the grounds of necessity. And Allaah
    knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
