Is there any refutation of his specious arguments about the way of Ahl al-Sunnah?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.I do not know of any specific book that refutes Kashf al-Haqaa’iq, but I looked at the book and at its Contents page, and I found that most of those specious arguments are repeated. They have been refuted by Ahl al-Sunnah in numerous books and writings. These books include the following:

43307,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43307,She forgot to do ghusl from janaabah until the sun set,"What is the ruling on a woman who forgot to purify herself from janaabah one day in Ramadaan? Please note that intercourse had taken place before the adhaan of Fajr, but she forgot to purify herself before Maghrib.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If a fasting person becomes junub as a result of a wet dream or intercourse, he does not have to do anything, so long as that intercourse took place before the adhaan of Fajr. This is indicated by the fact that Fajr would come in Ramadaan when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was junub not as the result of a wet dream, and he would do ghusl and fast. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1926; Muslim, 1109, from the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her). 
Based on this, your fast on that day is still valid, but you should have hastened to do ghusl, because you have to pray, and the prayers must be done on time, it is not permissible to delay them. 
Prayer is very important in Islam; it is more important that fasting or zakaah or Hajj or any other act of worship. Being lazy with regard to the prayer is a very serious matter, and some of the scholars were of the view that the one who misses a single prayer with no excuse and does not offer it before its time is over is a kaafir.
A warning is issued to the one who does not pray in the hadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does not pray ‘Asr, his good deeds are cancelled out.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 553. 
For more information and commentary on this hadeeth, see question no. 49698. 
The lady who asked this question has to repent to Allah for not praying and for being lazy about praying on time. Allah accepts the repentance of those who repent, and He forgives those who return to Him.

43314,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43314,How will be people be able to bear the sun being brought close on the Day of Resurrection?,"How will the sun be brought close to mankind until it is one mile away from them on the Day of Resurrection without burning them, when if it were brought close now, it would burn the earth?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: 
The believer’s responsibility with regard to 
    reports of the unseen is to accept and submit to them, and not to ask how or why. This is the foundation on which out ‘aqeedah must be built, 
    because this is a matter that is beyond your comprehension. So you have to accept it and submit and say, “We believe. We believe that the sun will 
    be brought close to mankind on the Day of Resurrection until it is one mile away from them. Asking any futher questions about that is a kind of 
    innovation (bid’ah). Hence when Imam Maalik (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked how Allaah rose above the Throne, he said, “Asking about this 
    is bid’ah.” Similarly it is bid’ah to ask about all other matters of the unseen; man's attitude towards them should be to accept and submit. 
The answer to the second part of the 
    question, about the sun being brought close to mankind on the Day of Resurrection: 
We say that bodies will not be resurrected on 
    the Day of Resurrection in the form in which they were in this world, with their shortcoming and inability to bear that; rather they will be 
    resurrected whole and complete. Hence the people will stand on the Day of Resurrection for a day which is equivalent to fifty thousand years, 
    neither eating nor drinking. This is something which would be impossible in this world. Then the sun will be brought close to them and their 
    bodies will be given the ability to bear its being brought close, as we have mentioned above that they will be able to stand for fifty thousand 
    years without needing food or drink. So their bodies on the Day of Resurrection will be different from their bodies in this world.","From Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 2/35"
43322,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43322,Who are the Naasibis and what is the ruling on them?,"I would like to know about the following terms:

1- What is the definition of a Naasibi?

2- What is the ruling on such a person – is he a Muslim, a kaafir (disbeliever), one who has gone astray, or an innovator?

3- Are there some references which speak about the Naasibis?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Nasb in Arabic refers to setting something up or raising it.
    Mukhtaar al-Sihaah, 1/275. 

    In al-Qaamoos it says that the Naasibis (al-nawaasib, 
    al-naasibah and ahl al-nasb) are those whose religious beliefs include 
    hating ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) because they set themselves up against 
    him, i.e. took a hostile stance against him. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
    The Naasibis are those who set themselves up against Ahl al-Bayt (the 
    members of the Prophet’s household) and hated them and slandered them. They 
    are diametrically opposed to the Raafidis (Shi’ah). Sharh al-Waasitiyyah, 
    2/283. 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said, explaining the ‘aqeedah of 
    Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah: They (i.e., the Sunnis) love the people of the 
    household of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him); they regard them with love and loyalty, and they heed the command 
    of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    concerning them… but they reject the way of the Raafidis who hate the 
    Sahaabah and slander them, and they reject the way of the Naasibis who 
    insult Ahl al-Bayt in words and deed. Ahl al-Sunnah do not indulge in 
    discussions about the disputes that took place among the Sahaabah. 

    Al-‘Aqeedah al-Waasitiyyah, 
    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 3/154. 

    So the Naasibis are those who hate Ahl al-Bayt, especially 
    ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him), and some of them slander him and some 
    accuse him of being a rebellious evildoer, and some of them regard him as a 
    kaafir, as was referred to by Shaykh al-Islam (Manhaaj al-Sunnah, 
    7/339). 

    One of the most well-known groups who emerged from among the 
    Naasibis were the Khaarijis who rebelled against ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) and regarded him as a kaafir, and they added other innovations to 
    that. 

    Undoubtedly rebelling and hating the Ahl al-Bayt and other 
    Sahaabah is a serious kind of bid’ah (innovation) that implies slandering 
    this religion which was transmitted to us via the Sahaabah, the Ahl al-Bayt 
    and others. 

    With regard to whether they are to be regarded as kaafirs, 
    this varies according to the level of hatred for the Sahaabah, and their 
    motives. In brief, if they hate them for some worldly reason then that does 
    not mean that they are kaafirs or hypocrites, but if it is for a religious 
    reason, because they are the companions of the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then this is kufr. Anything in 
    between that is an area of scholarly dispute in general.  See question 
    no;45563 

    With regard to the ruling on the Khaarijis – who have a 
    similar mentality to the Shi’ah and added to that hatred of the Sahaabah, 
    regarding the one who commits a major sin as a kaafir, and other kinds of 
    bid’ah – there is some difference of opinion among the scholars. Shaykh 
    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 

    The ummah is agreed on condemning of the Khaarijis and 
    regarding them as having gone astray, but they dispute as to whether they 
    are to be regarded as kaafirs. There are two well-known views in the 
    Madhhabs of Maalik and Ahmad. In the madhhab of al-Shaafa’i there is also a 
    dispute as to whether they are kaafirs. Hence there are two views in the 
    madhhab of Ahmad. 

    The first is that they are wrongdoers, and the second is that 
    they are kaafirs like the apostates, so it is permissible to kill them 
    first, to kill those taken prisoner, and to pursue those who run away. If 
    possible they should be asked to repent as in the case of apostates: if they 
    repent all well and good, otherwise they are to be executed. 

    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 28/518. 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: With regard to viewing 
    them as kaafirs and stating that they will abide in Hell for eternity, there 
    are also two well-known scholarly views, which were both narrated from 
    Ahmad. The two views apply to the Khaarijis and those who went astray such 
    as the Harooris, Raafidis and others. The most correct of these views is 
    that their beliefs which are well known to go against what the Messenger 
    brought constitute kufr. Similarly their actions which are like the actions 
    of the kuffaar against the Muslims are also kufr. I have mentioned the 
    evidence for that elsewhere. But to declare a specific individual among them 
    to be a kaafir and to judge that he will abide in Hell forever is dependent 
    upon the conditions for declaring a person to be a kaafir being met and the 
    impediments to so doing being absent.  

    When we quote the verses and reports which speak of promises 
    and warnings, and who is a kaafir and a faasiq, we should quote them in a 
    general sense. We cannot judge that any specific individual is included in 
    the general meaning of those texts, unless one of the conditions is met with 
    no impediment.  We have already discussed this principle in Qaa’idat 
    al-Takfeer. (Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 28/500). And Allaah knows best. 

    The questioner should note that in their books the Raafidis 
    who go to extremes with regard to ‘Ali and the Ahl al-Bayt, and slander the 
    Sahaabah and regard them as kaafirs, often accuse those who disagreed with 
    their falsehood of being Naasibis, but by Naasibis they mean Ahl al-Sunnah 
    wa’l-Jamaa’ah. They do this to express their dislike of them for going 
    against their falsehood and following the way of truth. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn 
    Taymiyah said: “With regard to Ahl al-Sunnah, they regard as friends all the 
    believers. When they speak it is on the basis of knowledge and fairness, 
    unlike those who are ignorant or follow their whims and desires; they reject 
    the way of both the Raafidis and the Naasibis and they hold all of the early 
    generations in high esteem, and they recognize status and virtue of the 
    Sahaabah and respect the rights of Ahl al-Bayt as prescribed by Allaah.  
    They also recognize the varying status of members of the early generation, 
    and they recognize that Abu Bakr and ‘Umar enjoyed precedence and had 
    virtues that were not shared by anyone else among the Sahaabah. Manhaaj 
    al-Sunnah, 2/71 

    Based on this, we have to know who uses this word and who 
    they are referring to by that, lest we reject the truth, because of their 
    describing the people of truth in an incorrect manner. Because one of the 
    characteristics of the people who follow innovation is to attack  Ahl 
    al-Sunnah and describe them in offputting terms. What counts is that which 
    is in accordance with the Qur’aan and Sunnah and the way of the earliest 
    generations of this ummah, no matter how much the followers of falsehood try 
    to distort it. 

    Among the books which speak of the Naasibis and refute them 
    and their ideas, and discussed those who went to the other extreme, namely 
    the Raafidis, is Manhaaj al-Sunnah by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah. 
    You can refer to this book or some of its abridged editions.

43347,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43347,Improving Relationship With Husband,"I have a problem and only my Lord knows how bad it is. My problem is that my husband treats me badly and betrays me and does not acknowledge his Lord. This complete change happened three years ago and I have been putting up with it for so long for the sake of my children and in the hope that he would change. I used to think that his mother was influencing him, because his mother used to criticize me all the time behind my back even though I treated her well and respected her and took care of her. But she used to feel jealous of my husband’s love for me, and I felt that, even though in front of me she pretended to show love because I used to treat her well. This happened three years ago when she stayed with us in our house for five months after her husband passed away, and she left us after we traveled abroad for work. Since that time I have been suffering terribly.
My husband is no longer the husband that I know. I hope that you can help me, because I do not know what to do any more to bring him back to the way he was before. My sister is certain that he has been bewitched and is not in his right mind. Is this possible? And if it is then what can I do? I hope that you can advise me, because I do not want to get divorced or to turn to charlatans. My sister told me that there is a man of religion who treats people by means of Quran, and she asked me to give her my picture and a picture of my husband.
But I was afraid that this might incur the wrath of Allah. Is that permissible? What should I do in this situation? I hope that you will help me, because I am in a difficult situation. I hope that you will answer me quickly. I am turning to you – after Allah – in the hope that my Lord will show me a way out. May Allah relieve you of all difficulty and may Allah reward you with all good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.You should note that by His wisdom, Allah tests His slaves with good and evil, to show who among them will obey Him in all circumstances and who will only obey Him in some circumstances. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Who has created death and life that He may test you which of you is best in deed. And He is the All-Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving.” [67:2]
“… and We shall make a trial of you with evil and with good. And to Us you will be returned.”
[21:35]
One of the kinds of tests is that Allah may test one spouse with bad treatment on the part of the other, for whatever reason. Based on this, if what you have mentioned is correct and your husband has been bewitched or affected by strong hasad (envy) – for witchcraft and the evil eye do have an effect, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “The evil eye is real” [al-Bukhaari, Muslim] – then you have to do the following:
1 – Remember Allah a great deal (dhikr) and pray for forgiveness. Ask Allah to heal your husband and to make him be as he used to be. Nothing can alter the divine decree except du’a.
2 – Think about yourself and the way you treat your husband. It may be that you have changed in the way you treat him, without realizing. Be the best wife you can to him, and the best help, after Allah. Stand by his side during this trial and be his support, after Allah.
3 – Do not go to this so-called man of religion, for he is asking for your picture in order to practice trickery. See question no.  21124.
4 – There is nothing wrong with you going with your husband to a trustworthy shaykh, who treats people by means of the Quran and du’as prescribed by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). You could also recite the Quran over some water and you and your husband drink from it, and you could recite ruqyah (incantation) over him every day, and recite Surah al-Baqarah in the house. For more information on the ways of undoing the effects of witchcraft please see the following questions:  11290,  4010,  21124,  12198,  8291,  20954. For information on protection against witchcraft, please see questions no.  2662 and  22816. For information on various kinds of witchcraft please see questions no.  12578,  9432,  240. 
5 – Assuming that what has happened to your husband is not witchcraft or hasad (envy), then sit with him and discuss things frankly. Tell him what you feel, and agree to go back to the way things were. 
6 – You can ask some people – especially trustworthy relatives - to intervene and seek a solution to this problem, and to look into its causes and try to find a way of resolving it. 
Finally, we advise you to weigh up your husband’s good points and bad points, and do not forget his good qualities and his kind treatment of you, because this will motivate you to try to bring him back to the right path in his religion and in his relationship with his Lord, first of all, then in his relationship with you. 
May Allah make things easy for you, and make your husband happy with your obedience and make you happy with his good treatment.

43355,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43355,The wudoo’ of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was not invalidated by sleep,"What is the evidence that sleep invalidates wudoo’? How can we understand the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) got up for Fajr prayer after sleeping without doing wudoo’, according to the hadeeth about him praying qiyaam al-layl with Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him)?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
With regard to the evidence that sleep invalidates wudoo’, this is proven by the hadeeth of Safwaan ibn ‘Assaal (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to command us, if we were travelling, not to take off our khufoof for three days and nights, except in the case of janaabah, but not in the case of stools, urine or sleep. Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 89; classed as hasan by al-Albaani. So he mentioned sleep as one of the things that invalidate wudoo’. 
In the answer to question no 36889 , we have mentioned the different opinions of the scholars as to whether sleep invalidates wudoo’, and we stated that the correct view is that sleep invalidates wudoo’ if it is deep, but light sleep does not invalidate wudoo’. 
With regard to the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas referred to by the questioner, it was narrated by al-Bukhaari (698) and Muslim (763) from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: I slept in the house of Maymoonah and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was with her that night. He did wudoo’ then he stood to pray, and I stood on his left, but he took hold of me and moved me to his right. Then he prayed thirteen rak’ahs, then he slept until he was breathing deeply, for when he slept he used to breathe deeply. Then the muezzin came to him and he went out and prayed, and he did not do wudoo’. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) slept, and he got up to pray and did not do wudoo’. The scholars stated that this ruling (that wudoo’ is not invalidated by sleeping) applies only to the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because the eyes of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to sleep but his heart did not, so if he had broken his wudoo’ he would have been aware of it. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
The words “then he lay down and slept until he was breathing deeply, then he got up and prayed and did not do wudoo’” refer to something that applied only to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), namely that if he slept lying down, that did not invalidate his wudoo’, because his eyes slept but his heart did not, so if he had broken his wudoo’ he would have been aware of it, unlike other people. End quote. 
Al-Haafiz said: 
The words “he prayed and did not do wudoo’” – the eyes of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) slept but his heart did not, so if he had broken his wudoo’ he would have been aware of it. Hence sometimes he did wudoo’ when he got up from sleep, and sometimes he did not. Al-Khattaabi said: His heart was prevented from sleeping so that he would be aware of the Wahy (Revelation) if it came whilst he was sleeping. End quote. 
Al-Bukhaari (3569) narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “My eyes sleep, but my heart does not.” It was also narrated by Ahmad (7369) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him). 
See Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth al-Saheehah by al-Albaani, 696 
Ibn Maajah (474) narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would fall asleep until he was breathing deeply, then he would get up and pray, and he did not do wudoo’. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. 
Al-Sindi said in Haashiyat Ibn Maajah: 
This refers to the sound that is made by one who sleeps. 
“He would pray and he did not do wudoo’” because his eyes would sleep but his heart did not, as is stated clearly in the books of Saheeh. His sleep did not invalidate his wudoo’ because sleep only invalidates wudoo’ when there is the fear that something may come out of a person without him realizing it, but that does not apply in the case of one whose heart does not sleep. Then he said: The ahaadeeth about the sleep of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) should not be mentioned under this heading at all, i.e., the heading of wudoo’ being invalidated by sleep, without explaining that this ruling applied only to him.

43396,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43396,He vowed to fast every Monday and Thursday but he did not fast for several years,"Twelve years ago I vowed that if I passed the third year of secondary school with a good grade, I would fast every Monday and Thursday. 

For a long time I have not been regular in fasting, but during the last three months I have become regular in fasting. 

What is the ruling on the days when I did not fast? 

What is the ruling on some of the days when I am invited to lunch at my father’s house or elsewhere – should I fast on those days or not?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: It should be noted that making vows is makrooh, 
    because of the marfoo’ hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him): “Do not make vows, for vows do not affect the divine will at all, all 
    they do is get something from a stingy person.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 
    6609; Muslim, 1640. This version narrated by Muslim. 

    And it was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    forbade vows and said that they do not do any good, rather they just get 
    something from a stingy person. Narrated by Muslim, 1639. A person may 
    oblige himself to do something by making a vow then not fulfil it, thus he 
    puts pressure on himself and exposes himself to sin.  

    Being negligent with regard to a vow is a serious matter, and 
    there is the fear that the one who does that is included in the verses in 
    which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And of them are some who made a covenant with Allaah 
    (saying): “If He bestowed on us of His Bounty, we will verily, give Sadaqah 
    (Zakaah and voluntary charity in Allaah’s Cause) and will be certainly among 
    those who are righteous.”

    76. Then when He gave them of His Bounty, they became 
    niggardly [refused to pay the Sadaqah (Zakaah or voluntary charity)], and 
    turned away, averse.

    77. So He punished them by putting hypocrisy into their 
    hearts till the Day whereon they shall meet Him, because they broke that 
    (covenant with Allaah) which they had promised to Him and because they used 
    to tell lies”

    [al-Tawbah 9:75-77]
Concerning the 
    seriousness of being negligent with regard to vows, see also question no.
    42178. 

    With answer to this particular question, the vow which you 
    made is a vow of obligation, i.e., it is obligatory for you to fulfil it, 
    because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Whoever vows to obey Allaah, let him obey Him, and whoever vows to disobey 
    Allaah, let him not disobey Him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6696. 

    Based on this, you have to fulfil your vow. With regard to 
    the days when you did not fast, you have to make them up. As well as that 
    you have to offer kafaarat yameen (expiation for breaking a vow). One 
    expiation is sufficient for all the days when you did not fast. 

    Ibn Qudaamah was asked in al-Mughni (13/648) about a 
    person who vowed to fast every Thursday forever, then he did not fast for 
    several days. He said; Let him make up his vow and offer expiation… If he 
    has missed many days, then he has to offer one expiation for all of them. If 
    he offered expiation then he missed some more days, then he has to offer 
    another expiation. This was stated by Ahmad. 

    Your being invited to lunch is not regarded as an excuse that 
    allows you not to fast and not to fulfil the vow. You can tell them about 
    your vow so that you will have an excuse not to attend. And Allaah knows 
    best.
