204,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/204,A woman asking for divorce because of herhusband’s addiction,"A sister's husband became addicted to crack cocaine, and he beat her badly, threw a knife at her and tried to kill her, and abandoned her for four months. She requested a khula from the Imaam of the community and even though everyone could see how badly she was beaten (scars, bruises) and that her husband was no longer home, the Imaam refused to nullify the contract unless the wife drew up a written summary on paper of why she wanted a khula, which as she puts it ""is long as a book."" She refused to write it, and she did not get divorced. And as the weeks passed, it became apparent that the Imaam (who is a part of the bid'ah of giving bay'ah) was incompetant and handled the situation badly. Her husband rehabbed himself, and came home, and she accepted him back, and months later, his addiction came up again and he left weeks ago. She now wants a khula again, but she does not know what to do.  Please Advice.",,,"Praise be to Allah.the Lord of the Worlds.
If what is described in the question is true, then it is a lesson and a warning about how sin can destroy homes and families. Every Muslim must repent to Allaah and give up sin and disobedience.
It is very strange that this sister does not want to write down her reasons for asking for divorce. She should respond to this request what harm could it possibly do?
If the influential person who is responsible for the affairs of the Muslim community in that place sees that there is no possibility of reconciling the two partners and continuing the marriage, he should issue a divorce (khula divorce instigated by the woman) freeing her from the husband, on conditions that are mutually acceptable.
We ask Allaah to protect our families and the families of all Muslims from fitnah (temptation, tribulation), and to rectify all our affairs.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
205,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/205,"There is no such thing as bid’ah hasanah in
Islam","Bismillahir rahmaanir raheem,
  As salaamu 'alaykum,
  I have read a number of refutations written by the ash'areeyah/soofiyah regarding the
  concept ""bid'ah hasanah"" - they justify this concept by the narration in
  Bukhaaree's saheeh when the sahabi said ""Rabbanaa lakal hamd hamdan katheeran
  tayyiban mubaarakan fih"" when coming out of rukoo' and rasulullah (
) approved.
  They say Ibn Hajr was of this opinion and supported this view. Also they quote Ibn Hajr as
  condemning Ibn Taymiyyah as ""a slave who is leading others astray."" Any comments
  on this?",,,"Praise be to Allah.the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and blessings be
upon his truthful Prophet. 
Firstly, how can there be any such thing as bidah hasanah
(good innovation) when the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
him) said: Every bidah is a going astray and every going astray is in
Hell-fire.  So, if anyone says that there is such a thing as bidah
hasanah, he can only be insisting on going against the Messenger of Allaah 
(peace and
blessings of Allaah be upon him).
Secondly, saying al-hamdu Lillaah (praise be to
Allaah) when coming out of rukoo is a well-known phrase of dhikr which is
proven in sound ahaadeeth reported from the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
upon him). All that this Sahaabi did was to come up with a new phrase expressing praise to
Allaah. How can this be used as evidence to support innovations in worship and dhikr that
have no basis in the sources of Islam?
Thirdly, what this Sahaabi did cannot be taken as evidence in and of itself. It was not even considered to have been a correct action until after the Prophet   (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had approved it, and not before. But how on earth could this innovator obtain the approval of the Prophet 
(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) after he has passed away?""
Fourthly, if we accept the use of this report as evidence, it is still no more than an
isolated incident which cannot be generalized, whereas the hadeeth every bidah
is a going astray is clearly a general statement. It is a well-known principle among
the ulamaa (scholars) that what is stated clearly takes precedence over what
is merely implied.
Fifthly, how can we know what is good or not with our limited minds alone and without
the input of Revelation? Is there not the possibility of differences of opinion? What one
person sees as good will be seen differently by another, so what would the standard be?
Whose reasoning could we rely on or refer to? Would this not be confusion, even anarchy
itself?
Sixthly (which confirms the third point made above), when the Prophet 
 (peace and
blessings of Allaah be upon him) approved of an act of worship or a dhikr (remembrance of
Allaah) on the part of one of his Sahaabah, it would thus become a part of shareeah
and hence be regarded as a sunnah hasanah. But with the death of the Prophet 
 (peace
and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the ceasing of Revelation, how can we know
whether innovated acts of worship or dhikr are correct or would be approved? We have no
way of knowing, so we should limit ourselves only to the forms of worship that have been
narrated in sound reports.
The great scholar al-Haafiz ibn Hijr (may Allaah have mercy on him) narrated many
comments by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah in Fath al-Baari; he agreed with some and
disagreed with others. This is the business of the scholars: they discuss and debate with
one another, with the aim of reaching the truth  which may lie with the one who is
disagreeing or with the one whose opinion is being criticized. As for the unpleasant
comment quoted in the question, from what we know of Ibn Hijr (may Allaah have mercy on
him) and his good manners, fear of Allaah, awareness of the value of knowledge and respect
for the scholars, we are sure that this comment is a fabrication. May Allaah forgive all
the scholars and reward them for their efforts and concern.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
206,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/206,Characteristics of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah,Can you tell me the characteristics of jama’ah Islam that we must follow?,"Characteristics of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah are: 1- they follow the truth, 2- they obey the commandments of Allah, 3- they will be victorious until the Last Hour, and 4- they are patient and resist others with patience.","The attributes of the victorious group 


 Characteristics of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah


Who are the people of the victorious sect?","Praise be to Allah.It is the Muslim’s duty to follow the truth and to join the victorious group, the people of Sunnah and Jama`ah (Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah ) who are followers of the pious predecessors (al-salaf al-salih ), loving them for the sake of Allah whether they are in his own country or elsewhere, and cooperating with them in righteousness.
The attributes of the victorious group 
The attributes of the victorious group are related in a number of sahih hadiths, for example:

The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “My ummah is an ummah which carries out the commands of Allah; those who let them down or differ from them do not harm them and they will keep adhering to this path until the Day of Judgement.”
Mu‘awiyah and ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with them) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ‘A group of my ummah will continue victoriously adhering to the truth until the Last Hour begins.’”
Al-Mughirah ibn Shu‘bah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) say: “Some people of my ummah will remain victorious over the people until the decree of Allah reaches them.”
‘Imran ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “A group of my ummah will continue fighting for the truth, and will prevail over those who oppose them, until the last of them will kill al-Masih al-Dajjal (the Liar or Anti-Christ).”

From these hadiths we may understand the following:

The Prophet’s words “A group of my ummah will continue . . .” indicate that this is a section of the ummah, not the entire ummah. This also indicates that there will be other groups and sects.
His words “those who oppose them will not harm them” indicate that there will be other groups who oppose the victorious group in the way they practice the religion. This also concurs with the Hadith which describes the ummah being divided into seventy-two groups or sects who oppose the one group that is following the truth.
Both hadiths offer glad tidings to the people who are following the truth. The Hadith that speaks of the victorious group speaks of their victory in this world.
The words “until the decree of Allah reaches them” refer to the wind or breeze that will come and take the soul of every believing man and woman. This does not contradict the Hadith “A group of my ummah will remain victoriously supporting the truth until the Day of Resurrection,” because that Hadith means that they will continue to follow the truth until that gentle breeze takes their souls just before the Day of Resurrection, when many other Signs of the Last Hour have already manifested themselves.

 Characteristics of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah
From the hadiths quoted above, and other reports, we can derive the following characteristics of the victorious group :

They follow the truth. They are described variously as “following the truth,” “following the commandments of Allah,” “following the true religion,” etc.

All of these phrases indicate that they are adhering to the true religion with which Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) was sent.

They obey the commandments of Allah, which means:


They are distinguished from the rest of mankind by carrying the banner of Da`wah towards Allah.
They undertake the mission of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil.


They will be victorious until the Last Hour.

The hadiths say that “they will be victorious until the decree of Allah comes,” “they victoriously support the truth,” or “they will be victorious over those who oppose them.”
This victory includes:

Being open and not hiding: they are well-known and prominent and have the upper hand.
Adherence to true religion, righteousness, following Allah’s commands and fighting against His enemies in jihad
Victory by defeating others


They are patient and resist others with patience.

Abu Tha‘labah al-Khashani (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “After you there will come days of patience, in which the patience required will be like having to hold a burning coal in one’s hand.”
Who are the people of the victorious sect?
Al-Bukhari said: “They are the people of knowledge (the scholars).”
Many scholars said that the victorious group is the scholars of Hadith .
Al-Nawawi said: “It is possible that this group is scattered among all types of believers. Some may be brave fighters, or jurists, or scholars of Hadith, or ascetics, or people who enjoin good and forbid evil, and other types of good people.”
Al-Nawawi also said: “It could be a group of different types of believers, including those who are brave and skilled in warfare, faqihs, scholars of Hadith, Quranic commentators (mufassirin), those who enjoin good and forbid evil, ascetics and devoted worshippers.”
Ibn Hajar, may Allah have mercy on him, explained the matter as follows: “They do not have to all be in one city; they could be gathered in one country or dispersed across the world. They may be gathered in one city or in a part of it. It is possible that one group may exist, then disappear, then be replaced by another group, and so on, until the Day of Judgement, when all will disappear except for one group in one city, who will disappear when the breeze decreed by Allah comes.”
The scholars’ discussion of this group does not specify one type of people, or one city or country, except for the last group, which will be in al-Sham (the territory comprising modern-day Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine) and will fight the Dajjal, as the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said.
No doubt those who are involved with the sciences of Shari`ah – `aqidah, fiqh, Hadith and tafsir, studying and teaching – are the people who are most qualified to be called the Victorious Group, and they should be at the forefront of Da`wah and jihad, and enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and refuting the people of bid`ah, all of which must be accompanied with sound knowledge based on the Revelation.
We ask Allah to make us among them. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) did not neglect prayers during the night nor the two rak`ahs before Fajr neither in residence nor in travel.,,"Praise be to Allah.The majority of scholars assert that witr prayer is a confirmed sunnah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) practiced consistently, and that it is not obligatory. This is based on the hadith regarding the Bedouin who once came to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) asking about Islam, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) answered, ""Five prayers within one day-and-night."" The Bedouin asked, ""Am I obliged to other than those?"" The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) replied, ""(not) Unless you volunteer of your own."" (Agreed upon)
Some scholars have said that qiyam al-layl (prayer at the heart of night) and witr prayer are the best of the voluntary prayers . Therefore, one should consistently practice them and not neglect them. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) did not neglect the prayers during the  night nor two rak`ahs before Fajr neither in residence nor in travel as reported in authentic hadiths.

209,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/209,How many adhaan for fajr,"How many adthans are there for fajr? If people are in the mosque do you still say 
""prayer is better than sleep"" I heard it is a biddah to do this. Apparently there is a hadith 
to this effect. Could you send something?",,,"Praise be to Allah.There were two calls for salaat ul-fajr (prayer) at the time of Allaah's Messenger  (peace be upon 
him), the first just before dawnfor those who are awake performing night prayers( Qe iaam 
Al-lyl) so as for them to either rest for Fajr or have food if they intend to fast the next day, and for 
those who are asleep in order they may begin to arouse and be ready for Fajr( since it is preferred 
as early as possible)and the second at the actual time of fajr to indicate the appropriate time and to 
call people to the prayer, among other benefits of the adhaan. 
Regarding the second point, jumhoor al-'ulemaa' (majority of the scholars) agree that the statement 
(within adhaan for fajr) ""prayer is superior to sleeping"" should be said in the second call to prayer. 
Hence, the caller or mu'athin should adhere to the saying phrase and recite it even if people are inside 
the mosque. It contains benefits which might be slip one's mind. Moreover, it reminds people of the 
very fact: ""prayer is superior to sleep"" which concerns the immediate day as well as all forthcoming 
days. Muslims benefit from it even when they are already in the mosque and gain the reward of 
repeating it after mu'athin, as per the saying of the Prophet 
:
""If you hear al-Mu'athin, say [i.e, repeat] as he says"" 
which is hadith sahih. Perhaps women and children who live near the masjid may benefit as well, and 
even the Muslims among the jinn. Additionally, there may be some people who feel sleepy inside the 
mosque or those who have nodded off while sitting. Thus, Muslims should preserve and practice this 
sunnah and not abandon it. May Allaah make us all successful in following the sunnah and vigilant in 
adhering and preserving it.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

      the West, such as gelatin","For a great time now my community and I have been concerned with the issue of foods such as Gelatin, mono and dyglycerides, pepsin and rennetAll these thing are in our foods today and yet we do not know what we can eat and the reason for each. PLease give me a very detailed response that could end this trouble.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah
      has blessed His slaves by creating for them all kinds of provision on
      earth, and He has permitted them to eat from that which is halaal
      (permissible) and good; this includes very many things, it is not limited.
      Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O mankind! Eat of that which is lawful and good on the earth, and follow
      not the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan). Verily, he is to you an open
      enemy.” [al-Baqarah 2:168]
Allaah
      forbids a limited number of foods, as He says (interpretation of the
      meaning):
“Say (O Muhammad): “I find not in that which has
      been revealed to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to
      eat it, unless it be Maitah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth (by
      slaughtering or the like), or the flesh of swine (pork); for that surely,
      is impure or impious (unlawful) meat (of an animal) which is slaughtered
      as a sacrifice for others than Allaah (or has been slaughtered for idols,
      or on which Allaah’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering).”
      [al-An’aam 6:145]
 The
      Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade the
      eating of every carnivorous animal that has fangs, and every bird which
      has talons. (Narrated
      by Muslim, 6/60)
 And
      he forbade the flesh of (domestic) donkeys (narrated
      by al-Mukhari in al-Fath, no. 4215).
 Of
      the foods which are to be found nowadays, some of them are clearly haraam,
      such as dead meat [from an animal which has died naturally as opposed to
      being slaughtered properly] and pork. Some foods may contain ingredients
      and derivatives which come from haraam sources, so we have to find out
      where they come from so that we may know what the ruling is concerning
      them. The gelatin which was mentioned in the question may originate from
      the skin, muscles and bones of haraam animals such as pigs. Hence gelatin
      which is derived from collagen which comes from pigs is haraam, because it
      is as if the pig had been turned into salt. The most correct view is that
      it is haraam even if it has been changed, so long as it originally came
      from a pig, which is haraam.
 The
      fats which are used in foods come either from vegetable sources or animal
      sources.
 If
      they come from vegetable sources they are halaal, so long as they have not
      been mixed with anything that is impure (najjis) or anything that could
      contaminate them. If they come from animal sources, they are either from
      animals that we are permitted to eat or animals that we are not permitted
      to eat. 
If
      they come from an animal that we are permitted to eat, then they come
      under the same ruling as the meat of that animal. 
If
      they come from an animal which it is haraam for us to eat – such as pigs
      – then we look at whether they are used in foods or for other purposes. 
If
      they are usedfor non-food
      purposes, e.g. many fats are used in making soap, then there is a
      difference of scholarly opinion, but the most correct view is that they
      are haraam. 
If
      they are used in foods, e.g., pig fat (lard) is used in making sweets and
      other foods, this is haraam. 
With
      regard to cheese: if it is made from the milk of an animal which we are
      not permitted to eat, then according to scholarly consensus it is not
      permissible to eat it. If it is made from the milk of an animal which we
      are permitted to eat, and it is known that it is made with rennet that has
      been derived from an animal slaughtered according to sharee’ah andit has not been mixed with any najaasah (impurity), then it may be
      eaten. 
If
      it was made with rennet derived from dead meat, there is a difference of
      scholarly opinion as to whether we may eat it, but the most correct view
      is that it is haraam. 
If
      it was made with rennet from a source which is inherently naajis (impure),
      such as rennet derived from pigs, then it should not be eaten. 
See
      Ahkaam al-At’imah fi’l-Sharee’ah al-Islamiyyah by al-Tareeqi,
      p. 482 
In
      many cases these matters are unclear to the Muslim (he does not know the
      source of food ingredients). In this case, it is better to fear Allaah and
      be cautious. Avoiding doubtful things may be preferable to using them in
      these circumstances, as stated in the hadeeth narrated by al-Nu’maan ibn
      Basheer (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: I heard the Messenger
      of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say – and
      al-Nu’maan pointed to hisears
      – “That which is lawful is plain and that which is unlawful is plain,
      and between the two of them there are doubtful matters about which not
      many people know. Thus he who avoids doubtful matters clears himself in
      regard to his religion and his honour, but he who falls into doubtful
      matters falls into that which is unlawful, like the shepherd who pastures
      around a sanctuary, all but grazing therein. Truly every king has a
      sanctuary, and truly Allaah’s sanctuary is His prohibitions. Truly in
      the body there is a morsel of flesh which, if it is sound, all the body issound and which, if it is corrupt, all of it will be corrupt. Truly
      it is the heart.”
(Narrated
      by Muslim, 1599).
From
      the above we learn that the basic principle concerning food is that it is
      halaal, apart from those things for which there is clear evidence (daleel)
      that they are haraam, such as dead meat, blood, animals sacrificed to
      other than Allaah and meat over which the name of Allaah was not
      pronounced at the time of slaughter. Concerning the foods mentioned in the
      question: if it is proven that they contain ingredients derived from
      haraam sources, it is necessary to avoid them, otherwise they need not be
      avoided. If you are not sure whether they contain anything haraam or not
      – without being paranoid or succumbing to the waswaas (insinuating
      whispers of the Shaytaan) – then it is preferable to avoid them as a
      precaution out of fear of Allaah.

211,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/211,Sujood Ul-Sahw if in doubt while praying,"The question is regarding the unsureness of the number of rakaats ones prayed. How would we go about correcting it. Some say at the end of prayer you say salam once and go into sujdah and others say you finish your prayer and than do the sujdah.
This issue is very confusing please explain.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The prostration of forgetfulness (sujood ul-sahw) is required whenever one inadvertently adds extraneous parts or misses parts or is in doubt regarding parts of the arkaan (essential pillars) of the prayer and/or its other requirements. The question posed regards what to do when in doubt regarding the number of raka’aat prayed, and the answer is covered in the following points:
First, definition of doubtfulness: when two possibilities are equally probable without knowing or feeling one is more likely true than the other.
Second, when one doubts after performing salaam: One should disregard such doubt. For example, take the case of one who has completed praying dhuhr then questions after finishing the prayer, ""Did I really pray four raka’aat or only three?"" Such doubt should be disregarded completely unless it is substantiated by clear and certain indications; otherwise, it opens the door to waswasah (the whispering of Satan) and unwarranted extraneous additions to the prayer.
Third, when one doubts during the prayer; this must fall into one of the following two cases:

One can discern that one of the two possibilities about which one is in doubt is more likely or more certain by virtue of one’s prevalent feeling or most likely inclination: In this case, one should act according to his best assumption and perform the prostration of forgetfulness after the salaam. The evidence for this opinion is what was related by Ibn Mas’ood, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet (peace be upon him) prayed either an extraneous addition or missed an essential part of the prayer (one of the narrators of the hadeeth was in doubt which). After saying ‘salaam,’ it was said to him, ""Oh Prophet of Allah, has there been a new change in [the way of performing] the prayer?"" He replied, ""Why [would you say that]?"" They responded, ""You prayed in such and such manner."" So he bent his legs and faced towards the qiblah and performed two prostrations then performed tasleem (saying ‘salaam’ to the right then the left). After facing towards us, he said, ""If something new had been introduced regarding the prayers, I would have informed you about it. To the contrary, I am but a human like you I forget as you forget, so if I forget, remind and inform me. If any of you doubts during his prayer then he should try to discern the more certain and correct case, then complete the prayer based upon it, then perform tasleem, followed by two prostrations."" (Al-Bukhari, Fath Al-Baari #401).
One cannot discern nor is there any prevalence apparent to indicate which of the two cases is more certain: In this case, one should assume the least of the two and continue based on this assumption, then perform the two prostrations of doubt before tasleem. An example of this would be one who while praying the dhuhr prayer is completely uncertain whether he has completed three or four raka’aat and cannot determine which is more true. Thus, he would assume the lesser of the two, i.e. three, and complete another raka’ah then sit for the tashahhud, then prostrate two prostrations before saying ""salaam."" The basis for this ruling is the hadeeth related by Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudri, may Allah be pleased with him, in which he said: the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, ""If any of you doubts during his prayer and he does not know how many [raka’aat] he has prayed, whether it is three or four, then he should discard and cast away his doubt. He is to continue upon what one is sure of [i.e. the lesser] then perform two prostrations before making tasleem. If he ends up [in reality] praying five [raka’aat], then his prayer will be an intercession for him; and if he ends up completely the [requisite] four [raka’aat] then it is targheeman for shaytaan."" (targheeman: i.e., a way of vexing Satan and humiliating and debasing him, as well as rejecting him as a result of his failure to achieve his desire of disturbing the worshipper.)

212,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/212,Accepting donations from non-Muslims,"Can muslims accept donations from
      non-muslims to use
     in Islamic Cause?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Imaam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) gave
    one of the chapters in his Saheeh the title of “Baab qabool al-hadiyah min
    al-mushrikeen (Chapter on accepting gifts from the polytheists),” under which
    heading he listed a number of ahaadeeth indicating that this is permitted.
    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar commented: “On this topic, Abu Dawood and
    al-Tirmidhi narrated from ‘Ayyaad ibn Himar [??] who said: ‘I gave the Prophet
    
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) a gift of a she-camel. He asked me,
    “Have you become Muslim?” I said, “No.” He said, “I have been
    forbidden to accept the gifts of the mushrikeen.”’ Then al-Haafiz (may Allaah
    have mercy on him) quoted some of the comments made by the scholars to reconcile the texts
    which indicate that such gifts should be refused with those which indicate that they
    should be accepted. (The scholars said that) gifts should be refused when the intention
    behind them is to win the Muslim over (by softening his heart towards them), and they
    should be accepted when by doing so there is the hope of befriending that person and
    opening his heart to Islam.
There is nothing wrong with accepting unsolicited gifts and donations
    from non-Muslims, and it is permissible to spend them on Islamic projects and in other
    ways.
But asking for donations from non-Muslims carries several risks, such
    as being humiliated in front of them or being controlled by them.
If there is no danger of such things happening, there is nothing wrong
    with asking. When he was still in Makkah, the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah
    be upon him) used to ask for help for the sake of da’wah, without any humiliation
    involved, from some of the mushrikeen, such as his uncle Abu Taalib and others. There is
    no humiliation involved in putting out charity boxes or circulating flyers giving account
    numbers for donations, and so on. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Thank You",,,"Praise be to Allah.All Praise be to Allaah.
Muslims must realize that the age of living estranged (religiously) in non-Muslim 
societies effects the proliferation of the haraam and the diminishment of the halaal.
It is very possible what you have suggested is true, since the business sector specifically 
is more involved in interest than those in the government sector. However, I do not 
think that this cannot be generalized as a matter of principle in this matter. In general,

So long as a woman adheres to these conditions, she may wear whatever she likes in public places and elsewhere, and her hijaab will be considered Islamic. These conditions may be summarized as follows:


The hijaab must cover her entire body


It should be thick enough to conceal what is underneath it


It should be loose-fitting, not tight


It should not be so attractive as to call men’s attention to it


It should not be perfumed


It should not be a dress of fame and vanity (i.e., it shouldn't be extravagant or excessively opulent)


It should not resemble the dress of men

My question is that there is I think (several hadith) where it says that Allah does not accept du'as and prayers of those who get there sustenance through haram means. If a little of the sustenance (money) is from haram means, and you are a minor in this case does hadith count in your case?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Expenditure is obligatory upon a father to his son/daughter according to the Islamic law and shari'ah, as regards his/her housing, clothing, food, drink and the like. However, the concept is not tied to being a ""minor"" in the sense of Western laws. The requirement according to Islamic shari'ah are:

that the person spent upon is poor or does not own anything, or does not own or possess what is enough for his requirements and is unable to gain their own income.
that the one spending has enough wealth to spend on himself and his wife.
that the one spending and the one spent upon are of the same religion.

When the son/daughter is in need for expenses, then he/she is allowed to take from his/her father's earning even though it is haram (forbidden). In such a case his/her du'aa' to Allah won't be affected, since being a minor, he/she has neither might nor power. But while doing so, he/she should abide by the following observations:

Not to expand and widen the scope of taking or accepting from his/her father's illegitimate earnings.
He/she should try if he/she is able to earn a halaal income to become independent and self-sufficient and no longer in need of the father's support.

Is a brother-in-law a mahram?


Warning against non-mahram relatives entering upon women in the absence of their husbands


Meaning of ‘the brother-in-law is death’


Can wife travel with husband’s brother?","Praise be to Allah.Can your wife serve your guests?
A wife is permitted to serve her husband and his guests if she is wearing complete hijab and nothing of her body can be seen. She is also permitted to sit with them so long as there is no sitting alone with one non-mahram man, wanton display or other cause of temptation involved.

As far as eating with them is concerned, if this involves uncovering some part of her body, then she should not eat with them.
Is a brother-in-law a mahram?
The husband's brother is not a mahram . The various types of mahram have been described in the Quran. On this basis, it is not permitted for her to travel with him .

In view of the seriousness of the matter of non-mahram men, especially the husband's relatives, entering upon women , and the fact that so many people take this matter lightly, there follow a few words of important advice:
Warning against non-mahram relatives entering upon women in the absence of their husbands
Some homes are not free of the presence of relatives of the husband who are not mahrams of his wife. They may be living with him for a number of reasons, such as brothers who are students or bachelors. These men enter the house without there being any sense of something strange, because they are known to the neighbours as relatives of the head of the household. The neighbours know that this is a brother, or nephew or uncle. This casual approach leads to many immoral deeds that earn the wrath of Allah because the limits that He has prescribed are not being adhered to. The basic principle in this matter should be the hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): ""Beware of entering upon women."" A man of the Ansar asked, ""O Messenger of Allah, what do you think about the brother-in-law?"" He said, ""The brother-in-law is death."" (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath al-Bari, 9/330)

Al-Nawawi, may Allah have mercy on him, said: 
“This hadith refers to all the relatives of the husband apart from his father and sons, who are mahrams for the wife and she is allowed to be alone with them; they are not described as ""death."" It refers to the brother, nephew, uncle, cousin and other relatives of the husband whom she would be permitted to marry if she were not already married. Because people customarily treat this matter so lightly, and a man may sit alone with his brother's wife, the brother-in-law is likened to death, and he is the foremost among non-mahram men who should be prevented from doing so.
Meaning of ‘the brother-in-law is death’
The expression ""the brother-in-law is death "" may have a number of meanings, such as the following:

That being alone with a brother-in-law may lead to religious doom if it results in sin.
That it may lead to actual death if an immoral deed is committed that dictates the punishment of stoning.
That it may spell disaster for the woman if her husband's jealousy leads to divorce.
That you should fear being alone with a non-mahram woman as much as you fear death.
That being alone with a non-mahram woman is as terrible as death.

All of this stems from the fact that Islam wants to preserve families and households, and prevent anything that could lead to their destruction. What do you say now, after hearing the warning of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about those husbands who say to their wives: ""If my brother comes and I am not here, show him into the sitting-room"" or a woman who says to a male visitor: ""Go into the sitting room"" - when there is no-one else present in the house?

To those who take the idea of trustworthiness as an excuse, and say things like, ""I trust my wife and I trust my brother or my cousin,"" we say: do not trust too much and do not doubt too much, but know that the hadith ""No man sits alone with a (non-mahram) woman , but the Shaytan is the third among them"" (reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1171) includes both the most righteous of people as well as the most immoral of people, and that Islam makes no exceptions whatsoever in such reports.

This is the problem. A man marries a woman and brings her to his family's home, where she lives happily with him, then his younger brother starts to enter upon her when her husband is absent, and they begin to talk in an affectionate or even passionate manner. This leads to two things: she begins to detest her husband, and grows attached to his brother, but she cannot divorce her husband, or do what she wants to with the other. This is the grievous torment. This story represents one aspect of corruption, besides which are other kinds which reach the level of immoral sexual conduct and illegitimate children.
Can wife travel with husband’s brother?
In answer to the second question, a woman is not permitted to travel with her husband's brother , who is not her mahram, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""A woman should not travel unless she is with a mahram, and no man should enter upon a woman unless she has a mahram with her."" (Al-Bukhari, 1729)
Among the conditions of a mahram for travel purposes are: he should be someone whom she is permanently forbidden to marry, such as her grandfather, father, brother, paternal uncle, nephew, etc.

219,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/219,What Are the Merits of Islam?,Why do Muslims think that Islam is true? Is there any factual basis?,"Among the merits of Islam is that it enjoins good characteristics such as truthfulness, patience, deliberation, kindness, humility, modesty, keeping promises, dignity, mercy, justice, courage…","Why Islam is the true religion


What are the good characteristics in Islam?


What is forbidden in Islam?","Praise be to Allah.Why Islam is the true religion
This is a reasonable enough question for one who has not entered Islam , but one who believes in and practices this religion already knows the blessings which are his because of this religion. There are many reasons for this, which include the following:

The Muslim worships One God, Who has no partner, and Who has the most beautiful names and the highest attributes. 

Thus the Muslim’s focus and aim is concentrated, focused on His Lord and Creator; he puts his trust in Him and asks Him for help, patience and support; he believes that Allah is able to do all things, and has no need of a wife or son. 
Allah created the heavens and earth; He is the One Who gives life and death; He is the Creator and Sustainer from Whom the slave seeks provision. He is the All-Hearing Who responds to the supplication of His slave, and from Whom the slave hopes for a response. He is the All-Merciful and All-Forgiving, to Whom the slave turns in repentance when he has committed a sin or fallen short in his worship of Allah. He is the Omniscient and All-Seeing, Who knows all intentions and what is hidden in people’s hearts.
The slave feels ashamed to commit a sin by doing wrong to himself or to others, because his Lord is watching over him and sees all that he does. He knows that Allah is All-Wise, the Seer of the Unseen, so he trusts that what Allah decrees for him is good; he knows that Allah will never be unjust to him, and that everything that Allah decrees for him is good, even if he does not understand the wisdom behind it.

The effects of Islamic worship on the soul of the Muslim include the following:


Prayer keeps the slave in contact with his Lord; if he enters it in a spirit of humility and concentration, he will feel tranquil and secure, because he is seeking a ""powerful support,"" which is Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. For this reason, the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say: ""Let us find relaxation and joy in prayer."" If something distressed him, he would hasten to pray. Everyone who finds himself faced with disaster and tries prayer finds strength, patience and consolation, because he is reciting the words of his Lord, which cannot be compared to the effect of the words of a created being. If the words of some psychologists can offer a little comfort, what do you think of the words of the One Who created the psychologist?


Now let us look at Zakah (the poor due), which is one of the pillars of Islam . Zakah purifies the soul from stinginess and miserliness, and accustoms people to being generous and helping the poor and needy. It will bring a great reward on the Day of Resurrection, just like other forms of worship. It is not burdensome, like man-made taxes; it is only 25 in every thousand, which the sincere Muslim pays willingly and does not try to evade or wait until someone chases him for it.


Fasting involves refraining from food and sex for an appointed time. It is a form of worship, and a way in which one can feel the hunger of those who are deprived. It is also a reminder of the blessings of the Creator, and it brings rewards beyond measure.


Hajj is the Pilgrimage to the sacred House of Allah, which was built by Ibrahim (Abraham, upon whom be peace). By performing Hajj one is obeying the command of Allah and the call to come and meet Muslims from all over the world.


Islam commands all kinds of good and forbids all kinds of evil . It encourages good manners and proper treatment of others. 

What are the good characteristics in Islam?
Islam enjoins good characteristics such as truthfulness, patience, deliberation, kindness, humility, modesty, keeping promises, dignity, mercy, justice, courage, patience, friendliness, contentment, chastity, good treatment, tolerance, trustworthiness, gratitude for favours, and self-control in times of anger. Islam commands the Muslim to fulfil his duty towards his parents and to uphold family ties, to help the needy, to treat neighbours well, to protect and safeguard the wealth of the orphan, to be gentle with the young and show respect to the old, to be kind to servants and animals, to remove harmful things from the road, to speak kind words, to forgive at the time when one has the opportunity to take revenge, to be sincere towards one’s fellow-Muslims, to meet the needs of the Muslims, to give the debtor time to repay his debt, to prefer others over oneself, to console others, to greet people with a smiling face, to visit the sick, to support the one who is oppressed, to give gifts to friends, to honour his guest, to treat his wife kindly and spend on her and her children, to spread the greeting of peace (salam) and to seek permission before entering another person’s house, lest one see something private that the other person does not want one to see.
Some non-Muslims may do these things out of politeness or good manners, but they are not seeking reward from Allah or salvation of the Day of Judgement.
What is forbidden in Islam?
If we look at what Islam has prohibited, we will find that it is in the interests of both the individual and society as a whole. All these prohibitions serve to safeguard the relationship between the slave and his Lord, and the relationship of the individual with himself and with his fellow-man. 
The following examples demonstrate this:

Islam forbids the association of anything in worship with Allah and the worship of anything other than Allah, because this spells doom and misery.


Islam also forbids visiting or believing soothsayers and fortune-tellers; magic or witchcraft that may cause a rift between two people or bring them together; belief in the influence of the stars on events and people’s lives; cursing time, because Allah is directing its affairs; and superstition, because this is pessimism.


Islam forbids cancelling out good deeds by showing off , boasting or reminding others of one’s favours; bowing or prostrating to anything other than Allah; sitting with hypocrites or immoral people for the purposes of enjoying their company or keeping them company; and invoking the curse or wrath of Allah on one another or damning one another to Hell.


Islam forbids urinating into stagnant water; defecating on the side of the road or in places where people seek shade or where they draw water; from facing the qiblah (direction of prayer) or turning one’s back towards it when passing water or stool giving the greeting of salam (peace) to one who is answering the call of nature; and putting one’s hand into any vessel before washing it, when one has just woken up.


Islam forbids the offering of any nafl (supererogatory) prayers when the sun is rising, when it is at its zenith, and when it is setting, because it rises and sets between the horns of Shaytan (Satan); praying when there is food prepared that a person desires; praying when one urgently needs to pass water, stool or wind, because that will distract a person from concentrating properly on his prayer.


Islam forbids the Muslim to raise his voice in prayer, lest it disturb other believers; to continue offering supererogatory prayers at night when one feels drowsy - such a person should sleep then get up; to stay up all night in prayer, especially one night after another; and to stop praying when there is doubt as to the validity of one’s wudu - unless one hears a sound or smells an odour.


Islam forbids buying, selling and making ""lost and found"" announcements in the mosque - because it is the place of worship and remembrance of Allah, where worldly affairs have no place.


Islam forbids haste in walking when the iqamah (call immediately preceding congregational prayer) is given, and prescribes walking in a calm and dignified manner. 


It is also forbidden to boast about the cost of building a mosque; to decorate a mosque with red or yellow paint or adornments which will distract the worshippers; to fast day after day without a break.


Islam forbids building over graves, making them high, sitting on them, walking between them wearing shoes, putting lights over them or writing on them.


It is forbidden to disinter the dead or to take graves as places of worship. 


Islam forbids wailing, tearing one’s clothes or leaving one’s hair unkempt when a person dies. 


Eulogizing the dead in the manner of the times of Ignorance (Jahiliyyah) is also forbidden, although there is nothing wrong with informing others that a person has died.


Islam forbids the consumption of riba (interest); all kinds of selling which involve ignorance (of the product), misleading and cheating; selling blood, wine, pork, idols and everything that Allah has forbidden - their price, whether bought or sold - is haram (unlawful); najash, which is offering a price for something one has no intention of buying, as happens in many auctions; concealing a product’s faults at the time of selling; selling something which one does not own or before it comes into one’s possession; undercutting, outbidding or out bargaining another; selling produce before it is clear that it is in good condition and free of blemish; cheating in weights and measures; and hoarding. 


A partner who has shares in a plot of land or a date palm tree is forbidden to sell his share without consulting his partners. 


It is forbidden to consume the wealth of orphans unjustly; to bet or gamble; to take anything by force; to accept or offer bribes; to steal people’s wealth or to consume it unjustly; to take something for the purpose of destroying it; to undermine the value of people’s possessions; to keep lost property which one has found, or to keep quiet about it and not announce it, for it belongs to the one who recognizes it; to cheat in any way; to ask for a loan with no intention of repaying it; to take anything of the wealth of a fellow-Muslim, unless it is given freely, because what is taken because of another person’s shyness is haram (impermissible); and to accept a gift because of intercession.


Celibacy and castration are forbidden, as is marrying two sisters, or a woman and her aunt (paternal or maternal), whether he marries the aunt after marrying her niece or vice versa, for fear of breaking the ties of kinship. 


It is forbidden to make deals in marriage, such as saying ""Let me marry your daughter and I will give you my daughter or sister in marriage."" Such reciprocal deals are a form of oppression and injustice, and haram. 


Islam forbids mut`ah (temporary marriage) , which is a marriage contract for a period of time agreed by the two parties, at the end of which the marriage expires.


Islam forbids intercourse with a menstruating woman, until she has purified herself (by taking a bath after her period ends), and also forbids anal intercourse. 


A man is forbidden to propose marriage to a woman when another man has already proposed to her, unless the other man withdraws his proposal or gives him permission. 


It is forbidden to marry a previously-married woman without consulting her, or a virgin without seeking her permission.


It is forbidden to wish (a newly married couple) ""Bi’l-rafa wa’l-banهn (a joyful life and many sons),"" because this is the greeting of the people of Jahiliyyah (ignorance), who hated daughters. 


The divorced woman is forbidden to conceal what Allah has created in her womb (if she is pregnant). 


A husband and wife are forbidden to speak (to others) about the intimacies of married life. 


It is forbidden to turn a woman against her husband or to take divorce lightly.


It is forbidden for a woman to ask for another’s divorce, such as asking a man to divorce a woman so that she can marry him. 


A wife is forbidden to spend her husband’s money without his permission, or to keep away from his bed without good reason, because the angels will curse her if she does that.


A man is forbidden to marry his father’s wife, or to have intercourse with a woman who is pregnant by another man. 


It is forbidden for a man to practice ‘azl (coitus interruptus) with his free wife without her permission. 


It is forbidden for a man to return home from a journey late at night and startle his family, unless he has previously notified them when he will arrive home.


A man is forbidden to take anything of his wife’s mahr (dowry) without her consent, or to keep annoying his wife so that she will give up her wealth.


Islam forbids women to make a wanton display of themselves (tabarruj). 


It also forbids extreme forms of female circumcision. 


Women are forbidden to admit anyone into their husband’s home without his permission; his general permission is acceptable so long as they stay within the limits of shari’ah (Islamic law). 


It is forbidden to separate a mother and child (in case of divorce); to let one’s womenfolk behave foolishly (in an immoral fashion) and not say anything; to let one’s gaze wander everywhere; and to follow an accidental glance with an intentional glance.


Islam forbids the eating of dead meat, regardless of whether it died by drowning, strangulation, shock or falling from a high place; eating blood, pork and anything slaughtered in a name other than that of Allah or for idols; eating the flesh or drinking the milk of beasts that feed on filth and waste matter; eating the flesh of every carnivorous beast that has fangs and every bird that has talons; eating the meat of domesticated donkeys; killing animals by keeping them and throwing stones at them until they die, or detaining them without food until they die; slaughtering with teeth or nails; slaughtering one animal (for food) in front of another; or sharpening the knife in front of the animal to be slaughtered.


In the area of clothing and adornment, men are forbidden the extravagance of wearing gold. 


Muslim men are forbidden to be naked or to expose their thighs; to leave their clothes long (below the ankles) and trail them on the ground for the purpose of showing off; and to wear clothes that will attract attention.


It is forbidden to bear false witness; to make false accusations against a chaste believing woman; to accuse someone who is innocent; to utter lies; to slander and backbite; to call people by offensive nicknames; to spread gossip and malicious slander; to make fun of the Muslims; to boast about one’s status; to shed doubts on a person’s lineage; to utter slander, insults and obscenities; to speak in an indecent or rude manner; or to utter evil in public, except by one who has been wronged.


Islam forbids telling lies; one of the worst kinds of lies is to lie about dreams, like fabricating dreams and visions in order to prove one’s virtue, or make some material gains, or to frighten an enemy.


Muslims are forbidden to praise themselves, or to talk in a secret way: two may not converse secretly to the exclusion of a third, because this is offensive.


It is forbidden to curse a believer or someone who does not deserve to be cursed.


Islam forbids speaking ill of the dead; praying for death; wishing for death because of some suffering that one is passing through; praying against one’s self, one’s children, one’s servants or one’s wealth.


Muslims are told not to eat the food that is directly in front of others or to eat from the centre of the dish or platter; rather they should eat from what is directly in front of them or thereabouts, because the barakah (blessing) comes in the middle of the food.


It is forbidden to drink from a broken edge of a vessel, because this could cause harm; or to drink from the mouth of a vessel; or to breathe into it. 


It is forbidden to eat while lying on one’s stomach; to sit at a table where wine is being drunk; to leave a fire burning in one’s house when one sleeps; to sleep with Ghamr in one’s hand, like an offensive smell or the remainder of food (grease); to sleep on one’s stomach; or to talk about or try to interpret bad dreams, because these are tricks of the Shaytan.


It is forbidden to kill another person except in cases where it is right to do so; to kill one’s children for fear of poverty; to commit suicide; to commit fornication, adultery or sodomy (homosexuality); to drink wine, or even to prepare it, carry it from one place to another, or sell it.

A Muslim is forbidden to forsake or shun his brother for more than three days, except for a reason sanctioned by shari’ah; to hold small stones between two fingers and throw them because this could cause injury to eyes or teeth; to include his heirs in a will, because Allah has already given heirs their rights of inheritance; to disturb his neighbour; to point a weapon at his Muslim brother; to hand someone an unsheathed sword, lest it harm him; to come (walk) between two people except with their permission; to return a gift, unless there is some shar’i objection to it; to be extravagant; to give money to foolish people; to wish to be like someone to whom Allah has given more of something; to cancel out his charity by giving offensive reminders of his giving; to wilfully conceal testimony; or to oppress orphans or scold one who asks for help or money.

other one's personal comfort and ease.  Thus, if the husband sees that the
wife needs some time to become acclimated and develop their relationship

make it, he should borrow that money.

the truth?",,,"Praise be to Allah.wa aliaikum us-salaam wa-rahmat ullaahi wa-barakaatuh.

al-hamdu lillaah.


(a) Jumhoor al-ulemaa' (vast majority of the scholars) agree that the
aqeeqa is a sunnah mustahabbah for those who are capable of doing it and
can afford it.  Among its benefits are breaking the influence of the
shaitaan on the new-born.  It is also permissible for a Muslim to make an
aqeeqah for himself if his parents did not perform it for him.  Similarly,
he can do it for his children even if it is after many years if he didn't
do it when they were young. 

Refer to the book ""Tuhfat ul-Mawdood bi-Ahkaam il-Mawlood"" by Imam Ibn
ul-Qayyim, Chapter 6: ""The Aqeeqah and its Rulings"", Part 19: ""The Ruling
for One Whose Parents Did Not Perform an Aqeeqah--Should He Perform one on
His Own Behalf?"" for more details.  It is mentioned there that Ismaa'il ibn
Sa'eed al-Shaalanji  asked (Imam) Ahmed regarding a man whose father
informed him that he did not perform an aqeeqah on his behalf--should he
perform it on his own behalf?  He said, 

""That is the father's duty."" ...

and it was said, ""Should one perform an aqeeqah on his own behalf as an
adult?""  ... and I saw that it is preferrable if an aqeeqah was not
performed as a child then it should be performed as an adult, and (Imam
Ahmed) said:
""If someone does that I would not discourage it or regard it as
reprehensible."" 

(b) It is not mandatory for a person to take a loan in order to spend on an
aqeeqah.  However, if he does it then it would be considered commendable as
per Imam Ahmed's opinion.  It was related by Abi il-Harith that he asked
Abu Abdullah regarding one who doesn't have enough to perform an aqeeqah;
Imam Ahmed said, 
""If he borrowed for it I hope Allaah would reward and
provide for him by virtue that he has observed a sunnah.""

Signs of black magic


How to protect yourself from black magic and Satanic possession","Praise be to Allah.Signs of jinn or Satanic possession
People who have had experience with such situations have related that the following are among the signs of a person who is possessed by jinn (or Satan):

Strong repulsion when hearing the Quran or Athan (call for prayers).
Episodes of losing consciousness and/or epileptic attacks, especially when Quran is recited for the possessed person.
Frequent nightmares during sleep.
Tendency to avoid people accompanied by out-of-the-norm behavior.
The jinni who possess him might speak when the Quran is recited for the possessed person.
Madness, as stated in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): ""Those who devour usury will not stand except as stands one whom Satan by his touch hath driven to [epileptic] madness"" (2:275)

Signs of black magic
As for a person struck by magic he might experience the following:

Dislike of ones’ spouse, as indicated in the Quran by the following verse (interpretation of the meaning): ""And from these (angels) people learn that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife..."" (Al-Baqarah, 2:102)
Different attitude in the house from that which is outside the house. For example, a person will feel that he is missing his family when is outside the house but when he goes home, love changes quickly to extreme hatred.
Inability to have sexual intercourse with ones spouse.
Frequent miscarriage for pregnant women.
Sudden change in behavior without obvious reason.
Complete loss of appetite for food.
Thinking or imagining one has done something when in reality one has not.
Sudden obedience and/or love for a particular person.

It should be noted that if a person experiences some of the above symptoms this does not necessarily mean that he is either possessed by a jinni or struck by black magic. It might be due to physiological or psychological reasons.
How to protect yourself from black magic and Satanic possession
As for curing this condition the following steps are recommended:

Putting ones trust in Allah with a sincere belief that He is the only cure for everything.
Reading Quran and known supplications expressing seeking refuge, the most important and effective of which is sura 113 and 114, Al-Falaq and Al-Nas, which were used to cure the Prophet himself. Surah 112, Al-Ikhlas, is recommended along with them, as well as the opening chapter of the Quran, Al-Fatihah. To cure black magic, some have successfully used seven lote-tree leaves. The leaves should be crushed, then mixed with water (enough for taking a bath). The following verses from the Quran are then recited: verse Al-Kursi (2:255), surah Al-Kafirun (109), surah 112, 113, 114; the verses which mention magic, which are: in surah Al-Baqarah (2:102), Al-A’raf (7:117-119), Yunus (10:79-82), and Taha (20:65-69). The possessed person drinks some of the water, and the rest is used to give him a bath.
Removing the elements of magic as was done by the Prophet when he was struck by black magic by a Jewish man called Lubaid ibn Al-’Asim.
Eating seven Aliya Al-Barniy dates (among the dates of Al-Madinah) first thing in the morning; if not possible, any dates will suffice, by the will of Allah.
Cupping --removing excess blood.
Offering supplications.

(Peace Be Upon Him) has cursed those who consume interest, and those who pay it. Borrowing money 
with interest is considered as peddling in it as the borrower pays it to the borrower. Whoever does this 
is to repent and express remorse, and he is to try as much as he can to return only the principle he 
borrowed without the interest, advising the person who lent him the money against this practice. If he 
cannot, as in the case of borrowing from interest-based banks, which rarely forgive but rather get back 
their dues even if by force, he is to return the principle plus the interest offering repentance to Allaah at 
the same time.
Whatever the borrower has bought or developed in terms of legitimate and Islamically-permitted 
business based on the borrowed money, can remain in his possession. He is allowed to continue his 
enterprise and profit from it, paying sadaqah at the time on a frequent basis to purify his business and 
himself of the misdeed he has committed. Those who work in businesses functioning on money 
borrowed using interest for which they are not responsible can continue to work in such enterprises as

My family think I am extreme in my views because I hold hadith in high regard, whereas my father does not. He believes that a hadith explaining the commandments in the Qur'an, for example praying, should be followed, but those concerning matters outside of the Quran, for example prohibition of touching a female who is not your mehram, should not be followed.

I eagerly await your response. Jazzakallahkhairum for your help.
Wa alaykum-as-salam wa rahmatulla wa barakatuh.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The situation in which you are, dear brother, is certainly a difficult one. It is not easy to live with a father that has aberrations and perversities stemming from being misguided from the true path of ahl us-sunnah wal-jamaaah (the followers of the Quran, sunnah, and our pious predecessors). However, a Muslim is to anticipate and seek reward from Allah for: being patient with and persevering in dealing with your father; and, being polite when counseling and showing him the truth of guidance, using appropriate and agreeable methods that do not give your father the impression that you are trying to show superiority or arrogance, or that you are belittling him. Instead, your father should feel that the advice is from a son that acknowledges and respects his position as his father, and that your concern is out of care and veneration., as the case was with Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) when calling his father to the path of truth. Allah the Most Glorious said in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning):
When he (Ibrahim) said to his father: ""O my father! Why do you worship that which hears not, sees not and cannot avail you in anything? O my father! Verily, there has come to me of knowledge that which has not come to you. So follow me; I will guide you to a straight path. O my father! Worship not Satan. Verily, Satan has been a rebel against the Most Beneficent (Allah). O my father! Verily, I fear lest a torment from the Most Beneficent (Allah) overtake you, so that you become a companion of Satan ( in Hell-Fire)."" He (the father) said: "" Do you reject my gods, O Ibrahim? If you do not stop (this), I will indeed stone you. So get away from me safely before I punish you."" Ibrahim said :"" Peace be upon you. I will ask forgiveness of my Lord for you. Verily, He is unto me, ever most gracious. (surat Maryam, 19:41-47)
Note that Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) addressed his father in the most subordinate and most refined, courteous, and polite expression (abati in Arabic). Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) did not say to him, ""I am a scholar and you are ignorant""; instead, he said ""There has come to me of knowledge (as a Prophet) that which has not come unto you."" Ibrahim (peace be upon him) showed his concern and compassion towards his fathers well-being when he said, ""O my father! Verily, I fear lest a torment from the Most Beneficent (Allah) overtake you."" When his father rejected the truth and threatened to stone him, Ibrahim (peace be upon him) replied in utmost politeness, ""Peace be upon you,"" and promised him that he will pray to his Lord on his behalf for forgiveness. This is how a righteous son should advise his misguided father.
You also should know that rejecting or denying the sunnah of our Prophet (peace be upon him) is an extremely grave matter; hopefully this subject will be covered in detail as a separate issue. In brief, if your fathers bidaah (innovation in religion) takes him out of the fold of Islam, then your prayers behind him is not valid since he would be a kafir (infidel, unbeliever). Such would be the case if, for example, he insists and persists in completely rejecting the sunnah in its entirety, even after the proof and evidence demonstrating and substantiating the truth and validity of the matter is presented to him. On the other hand, if your fathers bidaah does not take him out of the fold of Islam, such as the case of refusing to perform certain acts mentioned in the Quran and Sunnah, then it is permissible to pray behind him and your prayers are sound, and Allah knows best.
Addendum: Sheikh Muhammad ibn Salih ibn Uthaimeen has replied the following with regards to this question:
Denying (the sunnah) could be of two types: a denial with regards to interpretation or a denial of rejection. If it is a denial of rejection, in the sense that one might say, ""Yes, I realize that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said this, but I reject it and dont accept it,"" then the person is a kaafir (unbeliever) and has committed apostasy. Thus, it would be impermissible to pray behind him. If, on the other hand, it is a denial of interpretation, then he is granted a respite, if the interpretation is possible and warranted by the language, and he knows the sources of Islamic law and its resources. In this case, it is not an act of kufr, but rather under the category of those who innovate incorrect practices in the religion (if his interpretation is such). It would be permissible to pray behind such a person, unless there is a beneficial objective behind not doing so, such as deterring him from such opinions, so that he may reconsider his mistaken interpretations. In this latter case, then it would be preferable not to pray behind him (if such a beneficial effect would be realized).",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

How to express love for Prophet Muhammad","Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible to celebrate Mawlid al-Nabi (Prophet Muhammad’s birthday)?
There is nothing in the Quran to say that we should celebrate the Mawlid al-Nabi or the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet himself did not do this or command anyone to do it, either during his lifetime or after his death. 
Indeed, he told his Companions not to exaggerate about him as the Christians had exaggerated about Jesus (upon whom be peace). He said: “Do not exaggerate about me as the Christians exaggerated about the son of Maryam. I am only a slave, so say, ‘The slave of Allah and His Messenger.’” (Reported by al-Bukhari)
What did Prophet Muhammad do on the day of his birth?
What has been reported is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made the day of his birth a day of worship, which is different to celebration. He was asked about fasting on Mondays, and he said: “That is the day on which I was born and the day on which I was entrusted with the Mission or when I was first given Revelation.” (Reported by Muslim, al-Nasai and Abu Dawood)
Did the Companions celebrate Mawlid al-Nabi?
Moreover, we know that the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) were the people who loved the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) most. 
Was it reported that Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him), who was the closest of people to him and the one who loved him the most, celebrated the birthday of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? 
Was it reported that ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who ruled for twelve years, or ‘Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him), did this?
Was it reported that ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), his relative and foster son, did this? 
Was it reported that any of the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) did this?
No, by Allah! Is it because they were not aware of its importance, or did they not truly love the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? 
No one would say such a thing except one who has gone astray and is leading others astray.
Did leading Muslim scholars celebrate Mawlid al-Nabi?
Did any of the imams – Abu Haneefah, Malik, al-Shafi'i, Ahmad, al-Hasan al-Basri, Ibn Seereen (may Allah have mercy on them) – do this or command others to do it or say that it was good? By Allah, no! It was not even mentioned during the first and best three centuries. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in a saheeh hadeeth: “The best of mankind are my generation (or my century), then those who come after them, then those who come after them. Then there will come a people who will not care if their testimony comes before their oath or vice versa (i.e., they will not take such a matter seriously).” (Reported by al-Bukhari, Muslim and al-Tirmidhi). 
When did the celebration of Mawlid al-Nabi appear?
The celebration of the Prophet’s birthday appeared many centuries later, when many of the features of true religion had vanished and bid’ah had become widespread.
Thus this celebration became a sign of one’s love for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? But can it be possible that the Sahabah, the imams and the people of the best three centuries were unaware of it, and it was only those who came later who were aware of its importance?! 
How to express love for Prophet Muhammad
What the Quran tells us is that love of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is demonstrated by following the guidance he brought. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘If you (really) love Allaah, then follow me, Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Say: ‘Obey Allah and the Messenger.’ But if they turn away, then Allah does not like the disbelievers.” [Aal ‘Imran 3:31-32]
The first ayah explains that love is just a claim, but the proof of sincerity is following what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) brought. The second ayah reaffirms the importance and necessity of obeying Allah and His Messenger. 
Hence Allah ended the ayah with a very stern warning in which those who refuse to obey are described as kafirs, and Allah does not love the disbelievers. We ask Allah to keep us safe from that. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us of the danger of not obeying him, and the danger of adding to what he brought. The celebration of Mawlid or his birthday is indeed an addition to what he brought – as all the scholars agree. He said: “The best of speech is the Book of Allah, and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad. The most evil of things are those which are newly-invented (in religion), and every innovation is a going astray.” (Reported by Muslim and al-Nasai).
We ask Allah to protect us from bid’ah and to bless us by helping us to follow.

I know a lot of Muslims think that it is good to do so because it will protect them and their house. Personally, I consider it a form of shirk or superstition. Is there any ruling on that subject?","If hanging Quranic verses on walls is for purposes of decoration and adornment, this is an inappropriate use of the Quran as it was revealed to guide people and to be read regularly. The Quran was not revealed to decorate walls, but to guide mankind.",,"Praise be to Allah.Hanging plaques and cloths containing verses of the Quran in homes , schools, social clubs and places of business, involves a number of reservations and prohibitions according to Islam, such as the following:

In most cases, hanging such things on the wall is done for purposes of decoration and adornment, as the verses etc. are written in calligraphy and colorful brocade. This is an inappropriate use of the Quran, as it was revealed to guide people and to be read regularly. The Quran was not revealed to decorate walls, but to guide mankind.
Some people hang up such things for blessing - which is a form of worship. The blessing as described in Islam comes from reading or reciting the Quran, not from hanging it up or placing it on shelves or turning it into artwork and three-dimensional images.
This is contrary to the practice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Rightly-Guided Khalifas (al-Khulafa al-Rashidun), may Allah be pleased with them, who never did such a thing. The best way is to follow them, not to introduce innovations in religion. History tells us that in places such as Andalusia, Turkey, etc., the adornment of houses and mosques with ornate carvings of verses only happened at times when the Muslims were weak and humiliated.
Hanging up such pictures or plaques could lead to shirk, because some people think that these things are amulets that will protect the house and its people from evil and disease. This is shirk and is haram, because the One Who really offers protection is Allah, may He be glorified, and one of the means of gaining His protection is sincere recitation of the Quran and du’as taught in the Quran and Sunnah.
There is the risk that the Quran may be used, in such cases, as a means of promoting one's business or increasing one's earnings. The Quran should be protected from being used for such purposes. It is well-known that the production and sale of these pictures and plaques involves a great deal of extravagance and wasting money.
Many of these plaques are painted with real gold, which makes using them and hanging them up even more haram.
Many of these plaques involve a kind of carelessness, because the letters are twisted into complex designs that are of no benefit to anyone because they are barely legible. Sometimes words are fashioned into the shape of a bird or a man prostrating, and similarly forbidden pictures of animate beings.
Verses and surahs of the Quran are exposed to misuse and abuse by this practice. For example, when moving house, they are piled up with the rest of the furniture and belongings, and other objects may be placed on top of them. This also happens when they are taken down so that the wall may be painted or cleaned.
Some Muslims whose observance of Islam is lacking put these plaques and pictures up so that they can feel that they are doing something religious, in order to reduce their feelings of guilt in spite of the fact that this practice does not help them in any way.

All in all, we must close the doors of evil and follow the leaders of guidance of the early centuries of Islam, whose people the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) testified were the best of the Muslims in faith and practice. If someone were to say, We are not going to abuse it or make it a decoration or exaggerate about it, we only want to remind people (about their religion) in our gatherings, our response would be: if we look at real life, will we find that this is what actually happens? Do people really remember Allah? Do they even read these verses when they raise their heads?
What really happens is the opposite: people go against the words hanging over their heads, they still tell lies, engage in gossip, make fun of others and do and say evil things. Even if we assume that there are some who do benefit from these plaques etc., the fact is that they are very few, and this does not change the Islamic ruling on the matter.
The Muslims must turn to the Book of Allah, read it and recite it, and act in accordance with it. We ask Allah to make the Quran a light of guidance for us, and a means of removing our grief and anxiety. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

All Praise be to Allaah.
As long as you are confident in your heart about your belief, no such insinuations will hurt you (inshaa' 
Allaah). If a doubt strikes a believer or something appears to him as a conflict between different textual 
sources of Shari'ah, he must believe that indeed for such doubts there are true answers and for such 
apparent conflicts there are solutions even if he doesnt know it or is unable to find the right answer 
himself. However, a person should not collect all the doubts in his heart and worry about the 
complexities and leave aside the learning of useful knowledge. This is because it is incumbent upon a 
Muslim to learn and know things which have been clearly described (Muhkamaat) in Shari'ah so that he 
may be able to repel the doubts. 
Regarding the question you have asked, it is a known fact that legislation differs from one Shari'ah to 
another, while the principles and beliefs remain the same in all of them. So, making of portraits was 
allowed in the Shari'ah of Sulayman (peace be upon him) but is prohibited in our Shari'ah. Similarly, 
making prostration of salutation was permitted in the Shari'ah of Yusuf (peace be upon him) but is illegal 
in ours. Also, war booty was prohibited for nations before us but it is completely legal for us. The 
Qiblah of people before us used to be towards Bayt Al-Maqdis, but for us it is towards Ka'bah. In a 
similar way, marriage between brothers and sisters was permitted in the Shari'ah of Adam (peace be 
upon him) as opposed to those that came afterwards. The following is a clarification on the issue by 
Haafidh Ibn Katheer, who said: 
Allaah allowed Adam (peace be upon him) to marry his daughters to his sons for necessity. Every 
couple used to have a boy and a girl. Hence, he married the girl of one couple to the boy of another. 
This is said by Suddi regarding what has been narrated by Abu Maalik and Abu Salih, from Ibn Abbas, 
by Murrah from Ibn Masood and by other companions of the Prophet  (peace be upon him) that

Is there a way to make up for it after the prayer has finished or must the whole prayer be repeated? What if you remember when you are praying sunnah - should you break your prayer?","If you forgot to do sujud as-sahw, you can make it up if you are still in the mosque and a long time has not passed. If a long time has passed or you broke your wudu or you left the mosque, you do not need to do the sujud and your prayer is still valid.",,"Praise be to Allah.Imam al-Mirdawi said in al-Insaf (2/154): The author– Ibn Qudamah – said that two conditions apply for sujud to be made up later:

It should be in the mosque
A long time should not have passed.

This is the right opinion, as he stated.
Imam Ahmad said: “He should do the sujud if the time that has passed is short, even if he has left the mosque.”
He also said: “He should do the sujud even if the time that has passed is long, or he has spoken or left the mosque. This is the opinion favoured by Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah].” (Al-Ikhtiyarat al-Fiqhiyyah, p. 94)
In Al-Rawd al-Murbi’ Sharh Zad al-Mustaqni’ (2/461) it says: 
“(If he forgets), i.e., he forgets to do the sujud as-sahw which should be done before the salam, (and he says salam), then he remembers, (he should do the sujud) and it is obligatory (if the time that has passed is short)… If he has said salam – and if a long time has passed according to what is ordinarily regarded as a long time, or he broke his wudu, or he left the mosque – he does not need to do the sujud, and his prayer is still valid.”
In Al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin (3/537), it says: 
“The phrase ‘If he forgets and says salam, he should still do the sujud if the time that has passed is short’ refers to the sujud that should be done before the salam, when he has already said the salam. He should do this sujud if the time that has passed is short, otherwise he no longer has to do it, and his prayer is still valid.
Examples:
A man may forget the first tashahhud, so he has to do sujud as-sahw before the salam, but he forgets and says the salam. If he remembers shortly afterwards, he should do the sujud, but if he remembers a long time afterwards, he no longer has to do it. This is why he said ‘He should do sujud if only a short time has passed. If he has left the mosque, he should not come back to do this sujud – he no longer has to do it, which is unlike when he has said salam before completing the prayer. In the latter case, he should come back and complete it, because he has omitted an obligatory act.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said: Indeed, he should do the sujud , even if a long time has passed, because this will make up for what was missing. So when he remembers it, he should make up for it.
But the most likely opinion is that suggested by the author (may Allah have mercy on him), which is that if a long time has passed, the person no longer has to do the sujud, because sujud as-sahw is obligatory (wajib) either to make the prayer valid or it is wajib in the prayer as part of the prayer, so it is connected to the prayer and is not a separate prayer. We say that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever sleeps and misses the prayer, as soon as he remembers, let him pray.” (Reported by al-Bukhari (597) and Muslim (684) from the hadith of Anas) 
But we cannot use this evidence with regard to sujud as-sahw, because it is part of something else. If a person remembers soon afterwards, he should do it, otherwise he does not have to do it.”

Is it permissible (or obligatory) for sisters to pray in Jama‘a (with a leader) if there are no 
brothers? I’ve heard different views on this. 
Jazakumullahi khairan
wassalamu alaikum",,,"Praise be to Allah.wa alaikum us-salaam wa-rahmat ullaahi wa-barakaatuh

It is permissible for women to pray in congregation among themselves. Their leader should stand in the 
middle of the row according to the narration regarding Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) which 
indicates that she used to lead women in prayer and would stand with them in the middle of the row. 
This has been narrated by ‘Abdur Razzaq in Al-Musannaf 3/141 and Daraqutni 1/404, and is authentic 
due to evidences for it.
Similarly Umm Al-Hasan narrated that she saw Umm Salmah (may Allaah be pleased with her) leading 
women in prayer while she stood in the middle of their row. This has been narrated by Ibn Abee 
Shaybah 2/88 and is also authentic due to other supporting evidences.
Ibn Qudamah has quoted the difference of opinion on whether congregation for women is 
recommended, and then says about their leader: “The one who leads them should stand in the middle of 
the row. We do not know of a difference of opinion on this among those who support that one women 
may lead others in congregation. Since it is recommended for the women to be covered, ….. standing in 
the middle of the row makes it a better covering for her from the sides.”(Al-Mughni, 2/202) 
The author of Al-Muhadhdhab (4/295) says: “It is sunnah that the leader of women in congregation 
stand in the middle of them as narrated about ‘Aa’ishah and Umm Salmah that they lead women and 
stood in the middle of their row.”

261,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/261,Types of make-up that affect wudu and ghusl,I have been told that a woman cannot put nailpolish because the wadoo is not done with it. How far is this true. Can she wear nailpolish (or any sort of makeup and perfo9rm her wadoo and salat.),,,"Praise be to Allah.Some powders and cosmetics that are used as makeup form a insulating layer over the skin and prevent water from reaching it, while others do not prevent water from reaching the skin.
If a cosmetic item insulates the skin (e.g., nailpolish as asked in the question) then it is not permissible to perform wudu or ghusl over it, for any act of worship that requires wudu or ghusl (such as prayer, etc.). Allaah the most glorified and Almighty says (interpretation of the meaning):
""O you who believe! When you prepare for prayer, wash your faces and hands ."" Al-Maa'idah (5:6)
Washing implies that water must actually reach the part of the body being washed. Based on this observation, anything that prevents water from reaching the skin must be removed, otherwise purification will not be achieved, resulting in the prayer being void.
If the cosmetic item does not insulate the skin and does not prevent water from reaching it (e.g., dying by henna or similar things which do not insulate the skin), then wudu or ghusl may be performed with it.
Hence, dyes are of two type: the first is that which is waterproof, such as nailpolish, which must be removed before performing wudu or ghusl. The second is that which does not form an impermeable barrier to water, such as henna dye, and hence does not hurt the wudu or ghusl.
And Allah the most glorified and Almighty knows what is most correct and best.

He'll listen to whatever I talk about Islam.  Whenever I approach him he'll listen to me and I tell him, why can't you pray?  He told me he will, and I have heard this for the past ten to twenty years. One day I call him to pray and he gives excuses. I think that during prayer time his mind goes somewhere else; after that he thinks ""why can't I pray?"".  I am very tired of telling him.  I need advice.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If your friend is mentally sound, then all you have mentioned about him indicates his disrespect of prayers.  If he means what he says, then he would perform his prayers.  His claim that he likes prayers is not truthful; if it were, then he would perform them accordingly.  In fact, the following verse from the Holy Qur'aan applies to such a recalcitrant and unobservant person (interpretation of the meaning):
""Then there has succeeded them a posterity who have neglected and lost the prayers, and followed their lusts; thus, they will face devastation (on the Day of Judgment, i.e., he will face Hell)."" Surat Maryam 19:59.
By completely ceasing to perform prayers, a person is judged to be a kaafir, based on several ahaadeeth of the Prophet  (peace be upon him), one of which is:
""The obligation and pact between us and them (the munaafiqeen, the hypocrites) is the prayer, so whoever abandons it has indeed committed kufr (i.e., become a kaafir, a non-believer)."" (Tirmidhi, hadeeth #2621, and it is sahih)  The meaning here is that the hypocrites are guaranteed their security and immunity from being fought by the Muslims as long as they perform their prayers; if they abandon their prayers, then they are among the kuffaar, and are subject to being fought and killed in the war against them.  The Prophet  further says, ""What is between a person and committing shirk (associating partners with Allah) and kufr (disbelief) is abandoning the prayer."" (Sahih Muslim, #82)
The man in question, accordingly, is to be shunned--no one should eat the meat he slaughters; he is not to marry a Muslimah; he is not to inherit a Muslim relative; he is not allowed to enter Mecca; upon dying he is not entitled to Muslim burial rites such as the washing of the body or the shrouding or the funeral prayer; and his inheritance is to go to the the community fund and not to his inheritors. Thus, it is incumbent upon you to exert as much effort as possible in advising him and admonishing him concerning the gravity and danger of his crime, and of the punishment of Allah the Almighty.  If he persists and rejects your admonition, then you would not be wrong in abstaining from your friendship with him, until you can solicit help from other friends among those who accept guidance so that you may spend your time with them inviting him to Allah.",Islam Q&A

    should be bent and should touch the ground, is correct. It is a proven part of the sunnah
    of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah
    have mercy on him) reported in his Saheeh from Abu Humayd al-Saaidi that the Prophet
    
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he prostrated the tips
    of his toes would be facing the qiblah (Fath, no. 828).
    Abu Dawood reported from Abu Humayd al-Saaidi:
     he would bend his toes when he prostrated. (Reported by Abu
    Dawood, no. 716, Bab fi iftitaah al-salaah). The author of Awn
    al-Mabood Sharh Sunan Abi Dawood said: He would bend (yaftukh)
    his toes  the meaning of fatkh is to bend or flex, so he would bend his
    toes and point them towards the qiblah. (Awn al-Mabood,
    2/419). The hadeeth was reported by al-Albaani in Sifat al-Salaah p.
    142, 1411 AH edition [This book is also available in English under the title The
    Prophets Prayer Described  Translator].
    Pointing the toes towards the qiblah is sunnah and is encouraged, but
    if a person does not do it, his prayer or leadership of the prayer is still valid,
    especially as many people do not have the ability to flex their toes in the manner
    described. But everyone should put their toes on the ground when prostrating, because they
    are counted among the seven parts of the body on which we are commanded to prostrate. If a
    person lifts his feet off the ground when prostrating, and does not place the tips of his
    toes on the ground, then his prayer or leadership of the prayer is not valid.
With regard to the way one should sit between sujoods, two ways of
    doing this have been narrated from the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him).
Keeping the right foot upright and sitting on the left foot, as was
        described in the saheeh hadeeth which describes how he sat between two sujoods: He
        kept his right foot upright, and he pointed its toes towards the qiblah.
        This is the most well known way, and it is the way he sat most of the time.

Keeping both feet upright and sitting on the heels, as was described in
        the saheeh hadeeth which describes how he sat between two sujoods: Sometimes he
        would rest on both his heels and the balls on his feet. (See Sifat
        al-Salaah by al-Albaani, p. 152). This is not the way of sitting that
        is forbidden.
      
    
    If a person who is praying puts one foot on top of the other and sits
    on them, he is doing something other than the sunnah, but his prayer or leadership of the
    prayer is still valid. In all cases, we should guide people towards the sunnah and teach
    them about it, because this is an important matter  how could it be otherwise? The

Types of specific love


Types of general love","Praise be to Allah.Types of love in Islam
I was very happy to hear that you and your fellow Muslim sisters are studying Islamic issues and trying to find out about Islamic views of love. No doubt, you and your sisters understand the importance of the scholars’ views and referring to them in matters of dispute. I will quote here a number of views about love, so that you will understand the matter better, in sha Allah
Love in Islam may be divided into specific love and general love.
Types of specific love
Specific love may be divided into types that are permissible and types that are prohibited.

Permissible love:


Love of Allah : This is the most important obligation, as it is the basis of Islam. By perfecting one’s love of Allah, one perfects their faith. If one’s love of Allah is lacking, then one’s Tawhid is also lacking. The evidence for this is the verses (interpretation of the meaning):

“But those who believe, love Allah more (than anything else)” [Al-Baqarah 2:165]
“Say: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your kindred, the wealth that you have gained, the commerce in which you fear a decline, and the dwellings in which you delight are dearer to you than Allah and His Messenger, and striving hard and fighting in His cause, then wait until Allah brings about His Decision (torment). And Allah guides not the people who are Fasiqun (rebellious, disobedient).” [Al-Tawbah 9:24]
There are also other similar proofs in the Quran and Sunnah.
The love of Allah may also take the form of preferring what Allah loves and wants of His slave over what the slave himself might love and want. So he loves what Allah loves, hates what He hates, takes as friends or regards as enemies for His sake, and adheres to His laws. There are many ways to strengthen this type of love.

Love of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him): This is also one of the most important duties of Islam. Indeed, faith is not complete until a person loves the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) more than he loves himself, as in the Hadiths:

The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “None of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him than his child, his father and all the people.” (Reported by Muslim, no. 44)
‘Abdullah ibn Hisham (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “We were with the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), and he was holding the hand of ‘Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him); ‘Umar said to him: O Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him), you are dearer to me than everything except my own self. The Prophet (peace be and blessings upon him) said: No (that is not right), by the One in Whose Hand is my soul, (not) until I am dearer to you than your own self. ‘Umar said to him, now, by Allah, you are dearer to me than my own self. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: Now (you are right), O Umar.” (Reported by Al-Bukhari, no. 6632).
This love is part of loving Allah and is manifested by following the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and giving precedence to his opinion over that of others.

Love of the Prophets and the believers: This is obligatory because loving Allah dictates that one should love the people who obey Him, namely, the Prophets and righteous people. The evidence for this is the Hadith: “Whoever loves for the sake of Allah (i.e., loves the people of faith for the sake of Allah ) … has perfected faith” 

Obedience to Allah is based on the love of Allah. Faith cannot be perfected except in this way, even if one has a lot of prayers and fasting to their credit. ‘Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I have witnessed at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him), none of us would think that he had more right to his own money than his Muslim brother.”

Forbidden love :


This includes love that constitutes Shirk (ascribing rivals to  Allah), which is when a person loves something instead of Allah or as much as Him. In such a case he has taken that thing as a rival to Allah. This is the Shirk of love, and most people have taken things as rivals to Allah in love and glorification.
There are also types of forbidden love which do not go to the extent of Shirk, such as loving one's family, wealth, tribe, business or house, and preferring those things, in whole or in part, over doing the duties that Allah requires of him, such as Hijrah (migration for His sake), Jihad, etc. The evidence for this is the verse quoted above “Say: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your kindred, the wealth that you have gained, the commerce in which you fear a decline, and the dwellings in which you delight . . . are dearer to you than Allah and His Messenger, and striving hard and fighting in His cause, then wait until Allah brings about His Decision (torment).” [Al-Tawbah 9:24])

Types of general love
General love is of three types:

Natural love, such as the love of a hungry person for food, or a thirsty person for water. This does not involve any kind of glorification, so it is permissible.
Love based on mercy and pity, such as the love of a father for his small child. This also involves no kind of glorification, so there is nothing wrong with it.
Love based on acquaintance and friendship, such as that between those who share a common profession, or scholars in the same field, or people one meets on a daily basis (such as fellow-commuters), or people one does business with, or travelling-companions. This type of appropriate love between people or between fellow Muslim brothers does not imply Shirk or associating anyone else in one's love for Allah.

      mosque, is it allowed for him to perform the night prayer at home?
      What is the Prophet's 
 (peace be upon him) manner in performing night prayer?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If a Muslim performs Taraaweeh in
    congregation in the mosque, and wants to offer more prayers at home, he should pray a
    series of two-rak'ah prayers and should not repeat witr, because the Prophet 
 (Peace &
    Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: 
    ""There cannot be two witr prayers in one night."" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad and
    others, and deemed saheeh in Saheeh al-Jaami', 7565).
    Umm Salamah reported that the Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) used
    to pray two rak'ahs after witr. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi and others, al-Sunan 433).
    Al-Nawawi said: ""The correct opinion is that he performed the two rak'ahs after witr
    sitting down, to demonstrate that this is permissible, and he did not do this all the
    time."" (Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi Sharh Jaami' al-Tirmidhi).
    The sunnah is to make the last of one's night prayers an odd number of rak'ahs, as is
    reported (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, no. 943). But if he has already prayed with the imaam, and
    wants to perform more prayers on his own and has time to do so - especially in the winter
    - he should do as is outlined above.
    As regards the number of rak'ahs to be performed in the night prayers, the Sunnah is to
    perform no more than eleven rak'ahs, because of the hadeeth narrated by 'Aa'ishah may
    Allaah be pleased with her, who said:
    "". . . He never used to pray more than eleven rak'ahs, in Ramadan or at any other
    time . . ."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 1874).
    The best way to perform the night prayer is to pray two by two (rak'ahs), and to separate
    the two even rak'ahs of witr from the one rak'ah (i.e., not to join the three rak'ahs of
    witr). The evidence for this is the hadeeth of Ibn 'Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them
    both), who said: ""The Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) used to
    perform the night prayers two by two (rak'ahs), then he would end with a single
    rak'ah."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 940).

-examine men as a nurse in non-emergency situations at a non-muslim hospital.
-work at a home for the mentally ill where the co-workers are male and the patients are also.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If a woman finds that she has to work because of necessity, she is permitted to work outside the home, as is indicated by the fact that the two daughters of Shu’ayb used to water the sheep, and the story of Asma’ bint Abi Bakr working outside the home. If a woman is widowed with children, and has no breadwinner and is receiving no money from the Bayt al-Maal (treasury), it is permissible for her to earn a living. Although we say that a woman is permitted to work outside the home when it is necessary, she should nevertheless do only the work she needs to do in order to meet her needs. If a woman has professional skills which not every woman possesses, and which are needed by other woman and society as a whole, then it is permissible for her to practice her profession outside the home, so long as she adheres to the conditions prescribed by sharee’ah and has the permission of her legal (shar’i) guardian. The evidence that it is permissible for the woman to work outside the home in a field where there is a need for her work, as long as she adheres to the conditions prescribed by sharee’ah, is to be seen in the fact that at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), midwives used to attend women in labour, and skilled women used to practice circumcision, and he did not condemn them for doing so. It is also known that Rufaydah al-Ansaariyyah used to treat the wounded in her tent, which had been set up in the mosque for that purpose. She was very skilled in treating the sick, and her work was done with the knowledge and express permission of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Sa’d ibn Mu’aadh was transferred to her tent for treatment. This indicates that it is permissible for a woman to practice her profession outside the home, and by analogy we may deduce that it is permissible for a female doctor to open a clinic outside her home for the treatment of women and children. By doing this, she is fulfilling the duty of fard kifaayah (a duty falling on the entire community – if some people fulfil it, responsibility is lifted from the rest, otherwise all will be held accountable. Translator). Such clinics make it easy for sick women to come to a female doctor, hence they no longer have to uncover their ‘awrah before a male doctor when they need treatment.
But this permission is given on the condition that this work does not affect her duties towards her own home, husband and children, and that she has her husband’s permission, because these duties are her individual duties (fard ‘ayn), which take precedence over her responsibilities towards the community (fard kifaayah). When there is any conflict, her individual duties must come first.
(Al-Mufassal by ‘Abd al-Kareem, 4/272).
Another hadeeth which describes Muslim women at the beginning of Islam practising a profession was narrated by Hafsah, concerning a woman who used to treat the wounded. Al-Bukhaari, may Allah have mercy on him, reported in his Saheeh that Hafsah said: “A woman came and stayed at the fort of Bani Khalaf, and told us about her sister. Her sister’s husband used to go out on military campaigns with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He had been on twelve campaigns, and she (his wife) had accompanied him on six. She said, ‘We used to treat the wounded and take care of the sick…’”
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 313).
But a woman’s work as a nurse or doctor is regulated by the rules indicated in other Islamic texts. Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar, may Allah have mercy on him, commenting on the above hadeeth, mentioned some of these conditions: “What we learn from this hadeeth is that a woman is allowed to offer medical treatment to a non-mahram man (one to whom she is not related), so long as this takes the form of bringing medicine to him, for example, or other forms of indirect treatment (i.e. with no touching or direct contact involved) – except in cases where it is necessary and there is no fear of temptation (such as in an emergency situation or in the event of a disaster).”
If a woman works in complete hijaab, without touching a male patient, or being alone with him in any way, and as long as there is no fear that she may be the cause of temptation or be tempted herself, and she is not neglecting a more essential duty such as taking care of her husband or children, and she has the permission of her guardian, then it is permissible for her to work. In principle, men should be treated by male doctors and nurses, and women by female doctors and nurses. There should be no mixing of the sexes in medical treatment, except when it is necessary and as long as there is no fear of temptation.

292,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/292,Using interest to pay for tuition,"Assalam alaikum,
The question has arisen due to many needy Muslims who are being thrown 
out of schools due to lack of tuition. There are many Muslims who have bank 
accounts which give interest, and they have not been using it as interest is 
haram. What should one do with the interest. Should he leave it to the bank 
or can it be used for such case as paying the tuition to the non Islamic 
institutions ?
Please give valid reasons. This question is very important and urgent as the 
academic term has just started and funds are not available. 
Jazakawallahu Kheiran,",,,"Praise be to Allah.and may His peace and blessings be upon His Messenger 
Muhammad 
 and on his family and companions.
To the honorable brother: Sheikh Ali Darani , May Allah safeguard you , Judge of 
Nairobi - Kenya 
May Allaah’s peace and blessings be upon you.
I have received your question by e-mail concerning the legality of spending interest 
money for the benefit of needy students studying in educational institutions in your 
country. Herein, I will summarize the answer to your question according to what 
scholars have mentioned: 
If a Muslim has earned or received unlawful money, he should get rid of it. He must 
neither derive any personal benefit from it, such as spending this money in eating, 
drinking, housing, family expenditure, educational tuition, nor can he use it in averting 
hardship and acts of injustice as paying compulsory insurance fees, government or sales 
taxes, and customs and duty charges. Indeed, the intention of its removal must be the 
purification of one’s money from interest, and it is not considered alms giving because 
Allaah is pure and good and He, the Almighty, accepts only that which is pure and 
good.
This interest money can be spent in many beneficial areas, such as for the poor and 
needy, for medication costs for needy people, helping mujaahideen and advocators of 
Islam, sustaining the impoverished and relieving debtors who can not repay their debts. 
Moreover, this money could be used in Islamic Center needs, such as maintaining mosques (i.e. mosque washrooms and other such facicilities), roads, etc… Thus, spending this money in the tuition of needy students 
studying in educational institutions falls within the aforementioned possible avenues of 
expenditure. This is permissible even if these institutions are supervised and directed by 
unbelievers, on condition that the subjects areas studied are Islamically permissible and 
do not result in any harmful or unlawful consequences. Moreover, this interest is 
considered forbidden and unlawful to the one who earns it, but as for the people to 
whom this money given, it is permissible and lawful to make use of it, for it is 
considered as lost money that no one owns.
Finally, may Allaah grant us success in supporting Islam and Muslims.

Or you do one(fardh)or the other(sunnah)? 
Also, to become a Muslim,is it necessary to declare that you are a Muslim in the company 
of two other Muslims?  thank you",,,"Praise be to Allah.al-hamdu lillaah.

You don't need witnesses to become a 
      Muslim. Once you utter the Shahadatain believing in them, you are then a 
      Muslim.
