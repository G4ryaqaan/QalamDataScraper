During his days of Jaahiliyyah (ignorance – i.e., before he became Muslim), he earned a lot of money by dealing in drugs. He brought this money with him and opened a big bookstore and got married using this money. Recently he has been told that it is not permissible for him to give this money in charity, because Allah is Good and only accepts that which is good, Our question is, what should he do with this money, and how sound is what he has been told?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Who has guided him to Islam. We ask Allah to make him steadfast and to guide him to that which is good for him in this world and in the Hereafter. 
Secondly: 
By His grace and mercy, Allah has caused Islam to destroy the sins that came before it. When a disbeliever becomes Muslim, Allah forgives all that he did when he was a non-Muslim, and he becomes cleansed of sin. 
Muslim (121) narrated that ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When Allah put Islam in my heart, I came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “Give me your right hand so that I may swear allegiance to you.” He held out his hand and I withdrew my hand. He said, “What is the matter, O ‘Amr?” I said, “I want to stipulate a condition.” He said, “What do you want to stipulate?” I said, “That I will be forgiven.” He said, “Do you not know that Islam destroys that which came before it?” 
“Islam destroys that which came before it” means that it erases it and wipes it out. Stated by al-Nawawi in Sharh Muslim. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked a similar question, about someone who earned money by dealing in drugs before he became Muslim. He replied: 
We say to this brother whom Allah has blessed with Islam after he had earned haraam (unlawful) wealth: be of good cheer, for this wealth is permissible for him and there is no sin on him in it, whether he keeps it or gives it in charity, or uses it to get married, because Allah says in His Holy Book (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say to those who have disbelieved, if they cease (from disbelief), their past will be forgiven. But if they return (thereto), then the examples of those (punished) before them have already preceded (as a warning)” [al-Anfaal 8:38]
i.e., all that has passed, in general terms, is forgiven. But any money that was taken by force from its owner must be returned to him. But money that was earned by agreements between people, even if it is haraam, like that which is earned through riba (interest)or by selling drugs, etc. it is permissible for him when he becomes Muslim because Allah says, “Say to those who have disbelieved, if they cease (from disbelief), their past will be forgiven”. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas when he became Muslim: “Do you not know that Islam destroys that which came before it?” 
Many of the non-Muslims became Muslim after they had killed Muslims, but they were not punished for what they had done. So tell this brother that his wealth is permissible and there is no sin in it; he may give it in charity and use it to get married. As for what he has been told about it not being permissible for him to give it in charity, there is no basis for that. End quote.

46515,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46515,Ruling on selling on consignment,What is the ruling on selling on consignment?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Selling on consignment means that a person buys some goods and agrees with the seller that if he does not manage to sell them, then he will return them to the seller; whatever he sells of them he will have bought them. 
The scholars clearly stated that this kind of transaction is not allowed, because it involves ambiguity. Neither the seller nor the buyer knows how much will be bought, and whether all or some or none of the goods will be returned. 
It is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade ambiguous transactions. Narrated by Muslim (1513). An ambiguous transaction is any in which the outcome is unknown. 
Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (6/325): 
If he stipulates that if the product is sold, that is fine, otherwise he will return it, this is an invalid condition, but does it invalidate the sale? There are two opinions. Al-Qaadi said: the texts from Ahmad indicate that the transaction is valid. This is the view of al-Hasan, al-Sha’bi, al-Nakha’i, al-Hakam, Ibn Abi Layla and Abu Thawr. The second view is that the transaction is invalid. This is the view of Abu Haneefah and al-Shaafa’i, because it is an invalid condition, so it invalidates the transaction. End quote. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about selling on consignment and he said: 
What this means is when a person says, I sell these goods to you and whatever you manage to sell is what you have bought, and whatever you do not manage to sell, give it back to me. This transaction is haraam, because it inevitably involves ambiguity, because neither the buyer nor the seller knows how much of these products will be sold, so the matter is unknown, and it is narrated that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade ambiguous transactions, and this is undoubtedly an ambiguous transaction. 
But if it is necessary for the two parties to do the transaction in this manner, the seller should give his goods to the other party to sell as his agent, and pay him for his work as an agent. This will serve the interests of both parties, and the second party will be an agent of the first and be paid for that, and there is nothing wrong with this. End quote.

His religoin and character is just, but he made that mistake at his teens, almost 20 years ago, he repented and never made the same mistake again. Will Allah protect me if I marry him for good islamic reasons and stay obedient to Allah?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It states in sharee’ah that the Muslim should not expose 
    himself to harm. 

    That includes mixing with a person who has a contagious 
    disease, especially if that disease is serious and chronic, such as herpes. 

    The rulings of sharee’ah are addressed to everyone, sick and 
    healthy alike. 

    With regard to the one who is sick, Muslim (2221) narrated 
    from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The owner of 
    sick camels should not bring them to the healthy ones” – lest the disease be 
    transmitted to the healthy ones. 

    With regard to the one who is healthy, the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Flee from the leper as 
    you would flee from a lion.” Narrated by Ahmad, 9429; classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 7530. 

    Leprosy is a well-known contagious disease – we ask Allaah to 
    keep us safe and sound. 

    Muslim (2231) narrated from ‘Amr ibn al-Shareed that his 
    father said: Among the delegation from Thaqeef there was a leper. The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent word to him 
    saying: “We have accepted your oath of allegiance; go back.” 

    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in 
    Miftaah Daar al-Sa’aadah (2/272): 
He sent word to that 
    leper accepting his oath of allegiance so as to establish the shar’i 
    principle of avoiding the causes of harmful and hateful things, because a 
    person should not expose himself to the causes of harm. 

    Ibn al-Qayyim said in Zaad al-Ma’aad (4/147): 
Chapter on the guidance 
    of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on avoiding 
    contagious diseases and his advice to healthy people to avoid those who have 
    such diseases. Then he quoted the ahaadeeth mentioned above. 

    Your wish to marry this man who has herpes may be influenced 
    by emotion, and you think that you are being patient and forbearing, then if 
    disaster strikes you will regret it when regret will be of no benefit. There 
    is nothing to compare to good health. 

    Our advice to you is not to marry this person.

    We ask Allaah to bless you with a righteous husband who will 
    help you in your religious affairs.

46524,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46524,Can a Man Lead a Woman in Prayer?,"I am French and I recently embraced Islam. My question is about the prayer. I would like to know if one man is entitled to direct a prayer meanwhile there is only one woman behind him. In this case, the man and the woman are not married. So, I am wondering if this kind of prayer can be considered like a prayer in group (with more reward). Or, on the contrary is it misadvised or absolutely forbidden?","If the woman is one of your Mahrams, there is nothing wrong with you leading her in prayer and it will be counted as prayer in congregation. But if she is a non-Mahram, and if your leading her in prayer means that you will be alone with her, then in this case your leading her in prayer is prohibited.",,"Praise be to Allah.If this woman is one of his Mahrams, there is nothing wrong with him leading her in prayer and it will be counted as prayer in congregation. But if she is a non-Mahram, and if his leading her in prayer means that he will be alone with her , then in this case his leading her in prayer is prohibited. 
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“It says in Al-Muhadhdhab: It is disliked for a man to lead a non-Mahram woman in prayer, because it was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No man is alone with a non-Mahram woman but the devil is the third one present.” 
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary: 
“In this context, “disliked” means that it is prohibited. This applies if he is alone with her. 
Our companions said: If a man leads his wife or a woman who is his Mahram in prayer, and is alone with her, that is permissible and is not disliked, because it is permissible for him to be alone with her in situations other than prayer. If he leads a non-Mahram woman in prayer and is alone with her, that is prohibited for him and for her, because of the authentic Hadiths that I will quote below, in sha Allah. 
If he leads (a number of) non-Mahram women in prayer and is alone with them, the majority of scholars said that this is permissible, and this was narrated by Ar-Rafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him) in Kitab Al-Adad from our companions. 
His evidence is the Hadith which we will quote below, in sha Allah, and because when there are a number of women together , a man cannot usually behave inappropriately one of them in the presence of the others.  
With regard to the Hadiths mentioned above, one of them is the report narrated from `Uqbah ibn `Amir (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Beware of entering upon women.” A man from among the Ansar said: “O Messenger of Allah, what do you think about the in-law?” He said: “The in-law is death.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). The “in-law” refers to the husband’s relatives; what is meant here is a relative who is not her Mahram, such as the husband’s brother, paternal uncle, cousin, maternal uncle, etc. The husband’s father, son and grandfather are Mahrams and it is permissible for them to be alone with his wife, even though they are also in-laws. 
It was narrated from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one of you should be alone with a woman unless a Mahram is present.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). 
It was narrated from Ibn `Amr ibn Al-`As (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said from the pulpit: “After this day, no man should enter in secret upon a woman whose husband is absent unless there is another man or two with him.” (Narrated by Muslim)  
What is meant by a woman whose husband is absent means one whose husband is not in the house, even if he is in the same town.” (Al-Majmu`, 4/173, 174) 
Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The phrase “leading a non-Mahram woman or women in prayer who have no man with them” means: it is disliked to lead a non-Mahram woman or women in prayer.  
What the author says requires further explanation: 
If there is one non-Mahram woman on her own, then to say that it is only disliked requires further explanation, if that means being alone with her. Hence it was interpreted in Ar-Rawd as meaning that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade a man to be alone with a non-Mahram woman. But we say: If he is alone with her then it is prohibited for him to lead her in prayer, because that which may lead to something prohibited is also prohibited.  
If there is more than one woman, i.e., if he leads two women in prayer, this is also subject to further discussion as to whether it is disliked, because if there is a second woman along with the first, this means that Khulwah (being alone with a non-Mahram member of the opposite sex) is no longer an issue, and if the man is trustworthy there is nothing wrong with him leading the two women in prayer. This happens sometimes in some mosques where the congregation is small, especially with regard to Qiyam Al-layl in Ramadan, when a man comes to the mosque and finds no men there, but he does find two or three or four women in the back of the mosque. According to what this author is saying, it is disliked for him to lead these two or three or four women in prayer. 
But the correct view is that this is not disliked, and that if he leads two or more women in prayer, there is no Khulwah and it is not disliked, unless he is afraid of temptation. If he is afraid of temptation, then it is prohibited, because whatever is a means that may lead to something prohibited is also prohibited. 
From the phrase “if there is no man with them” we may understand that if there is a man with them, then it is not disliked, this is clear.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 4/250-252)

46529,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46529,Is praying in pants invalid?,"Is praying in pants invalid? I have heard some people say that, because pants show the shape of the ‘awrah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allah has commanded the one who wants to pray to wear his adornment. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes) while praying[and going round (the Tawaaf of ) the Ka‘bah] and eat and drink but waste not by extravagance, certainly He (Allah) likes not Al‑Musrifoon (those who waste by extravagance)” [al-A’raaf 7:31]
So the one who wants to pray is enjoined to adorn himself for prayer, and not to do what many Muslims do, unfortunately, which is praying in their nightclothes or work clothes, and not beautifying themselves for prayer, for Allah is beautiful and loves beauty. 
The scholars regard the minimum level of adorning oneself to be covering the ‘awrah. Hence they stated that covering the ‘awrah is one of the necessary conditions of prayer being valid, and prayer is not valid unless the ‘awrah is covered. 
What is implied by their saying “covering the ‘awrah” is that what is obligatory is covering the ‘awrah, and that no matter what is used to cover the ‘awrah, the prayer is valid, even if it is a tight garment that shows the shape of the ‘awrah. 
This is what have been stated clearly by the scholars of the various schools of fiqh (madhhabs). There follow their comments on that.
 1 – The Hanafi madhhab: 
It says in al-Durr al-Mukhtaar (2/84): It does not matter if it clings to the body and shows the shape of the body. End quote – i.e., the garment that one wears when praying. 
Ibn ‘Aabideen (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on al-Durr al-Mukhtaar: The phrase “It does not matter if it clings to the body”, such as if it clings to the buttocks, but if it is thick and the colour of the skin cannot be seen through it, but it clings to the limb and shows its shape so that the shape of the limb is visible, then that does not mean that the prayer is not permissible, because the ‘awrah is still covered. End quote from Ibn ‘Aabideen. 
2 – The Shaafa’i madhhab: 
al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmoo’ (3/176): If the colour is concealed but the size of the limb can be seen, such as the knee or buttocks and so on, the prayer is valid because the ‘awrah has been covered. Al-Daarimi and the author of al-Bayaan stated that it is not valid if the shape can be seen, but this is an obvious mistake. End quote from al-Nawawi. 
3 – The Maaliki madhhab: 
It says in al-Fawaakih al-Dawaani, 1/216: 
“It is valid if a man prays in a single garment”: that is subject to the recommended condition that it should be thick enough so that it does not show anything, otherwise it is makrooh, and it should cover all of his body. If it covers only the ‘awrah that is most private, or it shows the shape of the ‘awrah, then it is makrooh to pray in it, and the prayer should be repeated if there is enough time left. End quote. 
It is mentioned that it is makrooh to pray in a garment that shows the shape of the ‘awrah, not that it is haraam. 
It says in Haashiyat al-Dasooqi that praying in a garment that shows the shape of the ‘awrah is valid, but it is slightly makrooh, and it is mustahabb to repeat the prayer if there is enough time left. 
It says in Balghat al-Saalik (1/283): 
It is essential that the material be thick i.e., it not be see-through at a glance, and it should not be see-through at all, or it may be see-through when staring at it.  If it is see-through at a glance, then it is as if it was not there (i.e., it is as if he is praying naked, because he is not covered). But if it is see-through when staring at it then he should repeat the prayer if there is time, as when the clothing shows the shape of the ‘awrah, because praying in such a garment is makrooh according to the correct view. End quote. 
4 – The Hanbali madhhab 
al-Bahooti (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Rawd al-Murbi’ (1/494):  It is not a condition that the garment should not show the shape of the body or part of the body, because this cannot be avoided.  
Ibn Qaasim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on al-Rawd al-Murbi’, commenting on the words of al-Bahooti quoted above: that is in agreement with the three imams, Abu Haneefah, Maalik and al-Shaafa’i (may Allah have mercy on them); i.e., the view of Imam Ahmad concerning this matter is in accordance with the view of the three other Imams. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (2/287): If it conceals the colour but shows the shape, the prayer is permissible, because this cannot be avoided. End quote. 
Al-Mardaawi said in al-Insaaf (1/471): 
Al-Majd ibn Taymiyah said: it is makrooh for a woman to tie something over her clothes (such as a belt), lest that show the size of her limbs and body. Ibn Tameem and others said: it is makrooh for a woman to pray with something tied around her waist such as a wrapper or belt, etc. End quote. 
Shaykh Sayyid Saabiq (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Fiqh al-Sunnah (1/97): 
It is obligatory to wear garments that cover the ‘awrah even if it is tight and shows the shape of the ‘awrah. End quote. 
These are the comments of the scholars on praying in tight garments that show the shape of the ‘awrah. They clearly state that the prayer is still valid. 
But that does not mean that people are encouraged to pray in tight clothes, rather they should not wear tight clothes or pray in them, because that is contrary to the adornment that we are enjoined to wear when praying. Rather the issue here is whether the prayer is valid or not. 
Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan has issued a fatwa stating that if a woman prays in tight clothes that show the shape of her ‘awrah, her prayer is valid, although she is sinning by wearing these clothes. 
He said: 
It is not permissible to wear tight clothes which show the limbs and the shape of a woman’s body and buttocks. Tight clothes are not permissible for men or women, but it is especially forbidden for women, because the fitnah in their case is greater. 
With regard to praying in particular, if a person prays with his ‘awrah covered in such clothes, his prayer is valid in and of itself, because the ‘awrah is covered, but he is sinning by praying in tight clothes, because he has transgressed one of the prescribed requirements of prayer by wearing tight clothes. This is one aspect. Another aspect is that it is a cause of temptation and attracts attention, especially in the case of women. So women should cover themselves with loose garments which will cover them and not show any of the limbs of their body or attract attention. So it should not be a thin or see-through garment, rather it should be a concealing garment which will cover the woman completely. End quote.

But I also heard that if you read Surat AlMuzaamil you will become wealthy (rich). Are there any authentic ahadiths to prove this being said from our blessed Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: What you have read about the virtues of reading 
    Soorat al-Muzzammil is not correct, rather it is a fabricated hadeeth and it 
    is not permissible to follow it or take it as evidence. 

    It was originally narrated from Zirr ibn Hubaysh from Ubayy 
    ibn Ka’b (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) recited the Qur’aan to me 
    twice during the year in which he died, and said: “Jibreel (peace be upon 
    him) told me to recite the Qur’aan to you, and he sends greetings of salaam 
    to you.” Ubayy said: I said when the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) recited to me: “It is as if it was just for 
    me; did you single me out for the reward of Qur’aan because of what Allaah 
    told you?” He said: “Yes, O Ubayy. Any Muslim who recites the Opening of the 
    Book (al-Faatihah) will be given as much reward as if he recited two-thirds 
    of the Qur’aan, and he will be given reward as if he had given charity to 
    every believer, man and woman… and whoever recites Soorat al-Muzzammil will 
    be relieved of hardship in this world and in the Hereafter.” 

    Ibn al-Jawzi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: And he 
    mentioned a reward for every soorah until the end of the Qur’aan… this 
    hadeeth about the virtues of the soorahs is undoubtedly fabricated. 
    Al-Mawdoo’aat, 1/391. 
Al-Shawkaani (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: This was narrated by al-‘Aqeeli from Ubayy ibn Ka’b 
    in a marfoo’ report. Ibn al-Mubaarak said: I think that the Zanaadiqah 
    fabricated it. 

    The hadeeth has several isnaads all of which are false and 
    fabricated… and there is no dispute among the huffaaz that this hadeeth of 
    Ubayy ibn Ka’b is fabricated. A number of mufassireen were deceived by it 
    and mentioned it in their Tafseers such as al-Tha’labi, al-Waahidi and 
    al-Zamakhshari. No wonder, because they were not versed in this area of 
    knowledge. 

    Al-Fawaa’id al-Majmoo’ah fi Ahaadeeth al-Mawdoo’ah, 
    p. 264 

    The fact that this hadeeth is false was mentioned by Ibn 
    ‘Adiyy in al-Kaamil (7/2588) and by al-Suyooti in al-La’aali 
    al-Masnoo’ah (1/227) and by al-Dhahabi in Tarteeb al-Mawdoo’aat, 
    60, and by others. 
Note: Many ahaadeeth were 
    fabricated about the virtues of various soorahs of the Qur’aan. Their 
    fabricators’ intention was to encourage people to read Qur’aan and devote 
    themselves to that, and they claimed that they were doing good thereby. But 
    their intentions were misguided because that is undoubtedly subject to the 
    stern warning contained in the words of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Whoever tells a lie about me 
    deliberately, let him take his place in Hell.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 10; 
    Muslim, 4. It makes no difference whether the lie is intended for good or 
    for evil. 

    Mu’ammil ibn Ismaa’eel (d. 206 AH) investigated this hadeeth 
    until he found the person who admitted to fabricating it. Mu’ammil said: A 
    Shaykh told me this hadeeth and I said to him: Who narrated this to you? He 
    said: A man in al-Madaa’in, who is still alive. So I traveled to go and see 
    him, and I said: Who narrated this to you? He said: A Shaykh in Waasit. So I 
    traveled to go and see him, and I said: Who narrated this to you? He said: A 
    Shaykh in Basrah. So I traveled to go and see him, and I said: Who narrated 
    this to you? He said:  A Shaykh in ‘Abadan. So I traveled to go and see him, 
    and he took me by the hand and led me into a house, where there were some 
    Sufi people and a Shaykh with them, and he said: This is the Shaykh who 
    narrated it to me. I said: O Shaykh, who narrated this to you? He said: No 
    one narrated it to me; rather we saw that the people had turned away from 
    the Qur’aan, so we fabricated this hadeeth for them, to turn their hearts 
    back to the Qur’aan. 

    Another example is the hadeeth of ‘Ikrimah from Ibn ‘Abbaas 
    (may Allaah be pleased with him) concerning the virtues of the Qur’aan 
    soorah by soorah. Its fabricator, Nooh ibn Abi Maryam, was asked about it 
    and he said: I saw that the people had turned away from the Qur’aan and were 
    preoccupied with the fiqh of Abu Haneefah and the maghaazi of Muhammad ibn 
    Ishaaq, so I fabricated these ahaadeeth for the sake of Allaah. 

    See al-Mawdoo’aat by Ibn al-Jawzi, 1/394; Sharh

It is very distracting , constant thoughts in the head , I do want to get married but parents have high expectations, to become somebody first then think about settling.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It is narrated in al-Bukhaari (5065) and Muslim (3384) that 
    ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to us: “O young men, whoever among you 
    can afford to get married, let him do so, for it is more effective in 
    lowering the gaze and preserving chastity. Whoever cannot afford it, let him 
    fast, for that will be a shield for him” – i.e., it will reduce and weaken 
    his desire. 

    Based on this, if a person can afford to get married then he 
    should hasten to do so, because of the many benefits that this brings, as 
    mentioned by the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), 
    namely it helps him to lower his gaze and protect his chastity, increases 
    the numbers of the ummah and offers protection against temptation and 
    mischief. 

    Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “If I only 
    had ten days left to live and I knew that I was going to die on the last of 
    them, and I could afford to get married, I would get married, for fear of 
    fitnah (temptation).” 

    Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Celibacy has 
    nothing to do with Islam at all.” 

    If you fear hardship for yourself and that you may and fall 
    into sin, then in that case it is obligatory for you to get married. 

    In this case parents are advised to arrange their son’s 
    marriage and not to stand in the way of his remaining chaste and protecting 
    himself from temptation. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: “With regard to marriage, people fall into three 
    categories. Some of them fear that they may fall into sin if they do not get 
    married, in which case it is obligatory to marry, according to the view of 
    most of the fuqaha’, because this will make a person remain chaste and 
    protect him from committing haraam actions; the only way to do is to get 
    married.” 

    Al-Mughni, 9/341. 

    You have to deal gently and kindly with your parents and try 
    to convince them of your need to get married, and tell them that this will 
    never conflict with what they want for you in the future. You can also seek 
    the help of wise people among your relatives to convince your parents. 

    The questioner is to be commended for not going out to places 
    of fitnah (temptation) and not fulfilling his desires by haraam means. We 
    ask Allaah to make you steadfast and to help you to find a good wife who 
    will be a delight to you and your parents, for He is Ever-near and 
    Responsive.

The least complete way of praying Witr and what is to be recited therein","Praise be to Allah.Is witr prayer obligatory or sunnah?
Witr prayer is one of the greatest acts of worship that draw one closer to Allah. Some of the scholars – the Hanafis – even thought that it is one of the obligatory prayers, but the correct view is that it is one of the confirmed Sunnahs (Sunnah muakkadah) which the Muslim should observe regularly and not neglect. 
Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whoever neglects Witr is a bad man whose testimony should not be accepted. This indicates that Witr prayer is something that is confirmed. 
We may sum up the manner of offering Witr prayer as follows: 
Time of witr prayer 
The witr prayer starts when a person has prayed ‘Isha, even if it is joined to Maghrib at the time of Maghrib, and lasts until dawn begins , because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has prescribed for you a prayer (by which He may increase your reward), which is Witr; Allah has enjoined it for you during the time between ‘Isha prayer until dawn begins.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 425; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi) 
Is it better to offer witr prayer at the beginning of its time or to delay it? 
The Sunnah indicates that if a person thinks he will be able to get up at the end of the night, it is better to delay it , because prayer at the end of the night is better and is witnessed (by the angels). 
But whoever fears that he will not get up at the end of the night should pray Witr before he goes to sleep, because of the hadith of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever fears that he will not get up at the end of the night, let him pray Witr at the beginning of the night, but whoever thinks that he will be able to get up at the end of the night, let him pray Witr at the end of the night, for prayer at the end of the night is witnessed (by the angels) and that is better.” (Narrated by Muslim, 755)
Al-Nawawi said: 
“This is the correct view. Other ahadith which speak of this topic in general terms are to be interpreted in the light of this sound, specific and clear report, such as the hadith, “My close friend advised me not to sleep without having prayed Witr.” This is to be understood as referring to one who is not sure that he will be able to wake up (to pray Witr at the end of the night).” (Sharh Muslim, 3/277)
Number of rak’ahs in witr prayer 
The minimum number of rak’ahs for Witr is one rak’ah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Witr is one rak'ah at the end of the night.” (Narrated by Muslim, 752)
And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The night prayers are two (rak’ahs) by two, but if one of you fears that dawn is about to break, let him pray one rak’ah to make what he has prayed odd-numbered.”  (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 911; Muslim, 749)
If a person limits himself to praying one rak’ah, then he has performed the Sunnah. But Witr may also be three or five or seven or nine.  
How to offer witr prayer with 3 rak`ahs
If a person prays three rak’ahs of Witr this may be done in two ways, both of which are prescribed in shari’ah: 
1 – To pray them one after another, with one tashahhud, because of the hadith of ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used not to say the tasleem in the (first) two rak’ahs of Witr. According to another version: “He used to pray Witr with three rak'ahs and he did not sit except in the last of them.” (Narrated by al-Nasai, 3/234; al-Bayhaqi, 3/31. al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu’ (4/7): it was narrated by al-Nasai with a hasan isnad, and by al-Bayhaqi with a sahih isnad.) 
2 – Saying the tasleem after two rak'ahs, then praying one rak’ah on its own, because of the report narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), that he used to separate the two rak'ahs from the single rak'ah with a tasleem, and he said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do that. (Narrated by Ibn Hibban (2435); Ibn Hajar said in al-Fath (2/482): its isnad is qawi (strong).) 
How to offer witr prayer with 5 or 7 rak`ahs
But if he prays Witr with five or seven rak’ahs, then they should be continuous, and he should only recite one tashahhud in the last of them and say the tasleem, because of the report narrated by ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray thirteen rak’ahs at night, praying five rak’ahs of Witr, in which he would not sit except in the last rak’ah. (Narrated by Muslim, 737)
And it was narrated that Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray Witr with five or seven (rak’ahs) and he did not separate between them with any salam or words. (Narrated by Ahmad, 6/290; al-Nasai, 1714. al-Nawawi said: Its isnad is jayyid. Al-Fath al-Rabbani, 2/297. and it was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Nasai.)
How to offer witr prayer with 9 rak`ahs
If he prays Witr with nine rak’ahs, then they should be continuous and he should sit to recite the tashahhud in the eighth rak'ah, then stand up and not say the tasleem, then he should recite the tashahhud in the ninth rak’ah and then say the tasleem. 
It was narrated in Muslim (746) from ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray nine rak’ahs in which he did not sit except in the eighth, when he would remember Allah, praise Him and call upon Him, then he would get up and not say the tasleem, and he would stand up and pray the ninth (rak’ah), then he would sit and remember Allah and praise Him and call upon Him, then he would say a tasleem that we could hear. 
How to offer witr prayer with 11 rak`ahs
If he prayed Witr with eleven rak’ahs, he would say the tasleem after each two rak’ahs, then pray one rak’ah at the end. 
The least complete way of praying Witr and what is to be recited therein 
The least complete way in Witr is to pray two rak'ahs and say the tasleem, then to pray one rak’ah and say the tasleem. It is permissible to say one tasleem, but one should say one tashahhud not two, as stated above. 
In the first rak’ah one should recite Sabbih isma rabbika al-‘a’la (“Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High” – Surah al-A’la 87). In the second one should recite Surah al-Kafirun (109), and in the third Surah al-Ikhlas (112).  
Al-Nasai (1729) narrated that Ubayy ibn Ka’b said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite in Witr Sabbih isma rabbika al-‘a’la (“Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High” – Surah al-A’la 87), Qul ya ayyuha’l-kafirun (“Say: O disbelievers…” – Surah al-Kafirun 109) and Qul Huwa Allahu ahad (“Say: He is Allah, the One” – Surah al-Ikhlas 112). Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Nasai. 
All these ways of offering Witr prayer have been mentioned in the Sunnah, but the best way is not to stick to one particular way; rather one should do it one way one time and another way another time, so that one will have done all the Sunnahs.

    It is better for him to do Hajj on his own behalf, because 
    this is the basic principle, and he can make du’aa’ for himself and for 
    others among his relatives and all the Muslims. But if one or both of his 
    parents did not do the obligatory Hajj, then he may do Hajj on their behalf 
    after doing Hajj for himself, as a way of honouring them and treating them 
    kindly when they are incapacitated or after they have died. But he should do 
    Hajj or ‘Umrah for each of them separately; he cannot combine them both in 
    one ‘Umrah or one Hajj. End quote. 

    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 
    11/66 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was 
    asked: A woman wanted to do Hajj on behalf of her mother who had died, but 
    her mother had done the obligatory Hajj. Which is better: to do Hajj on her 
    behalf or to make du’aa’ for her? 

    He replied: 

    It is better for her to do Hajj for herself, and to make 
    du’aa’ for her mother, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “When a man dies, all his good deeds come to an 
    end except three: ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyah), beneficial knowledge, 
    or a righteous son who will make du’aa’ for him.” He did not say: a 
    righteous son who will do Hajj on his behalf or fast on his behalf or give 
    charity on his behalf or pray on his behalf. If someone were to ask us: 
    which is better, to pray and give the reward to my father, or to give 
    charity and give the reward to my father, or to make du’aa’ for my father? 
    We would say: it is better to make du’aa’ for your father, because the 
    Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) knew more than 
    us, and was more sincere than us, and more eloquent than us, and he did not 
    say, a righteous son who will do good deeds on his behalf; rather he said: a 
    righteous son who will make du’aa’ for him. This is what the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught us. End quote.

please answer in detail with evidence from the Qur'an and Sunnah and please answer soon ... we r having a lot of problems in our mosque because of this issue ...some say that we must not pray behind him while others say that we must pray behind him.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 
Shaving the beard in 
    whole or in part is a sin which is not permissible to do. The prayer of one 
    who commits a sin such as shaving the beard and the like is valid if he does 
    it as prescribed by Allaah, according to scholarly consensus. The prayers of 
    those who pray behind him, if he leads the prayer, are also valid, according 
    to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions. 

    Tuhfat al-Ikhwaan, p. 114, by 
    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz. 

    The fact that his leading of the prayer is valid is indicated 
    by the fact that the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) prayed 
    behind unjust leaders and ruler. ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar and Anas (may Allaah 
    be pleased with him) prayed behind al-Hajjaaj al-Thaqafi. Al-Shaafa’i said: 
    And he – meaning al-Hajjaaj – was bad enough (as an evildoer).  

    Once this is established, there is no point in saying, “I 
    will not pray behind this imam.” Rather you should pray behind him if not 
    doing so will lead to evil consequences, division or conflict, because 
    conflict is worse. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If by 
    not praying behind him the worshipper will miss out on Jumu’ah and prayers 
    in congregation, then no one does that except an innovator who is differing 
    from the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them). Similarly, if the imam 
    has been appointed by those in authority and there is no shar’i purpose to 
    be served by not praying behind him, then you should not refuse to pray 
    behind him, rather it is better to pray behind him. 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 
    9/388. 
Al-Nawawi (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him) said – concerning one who leads people in prayer 
    when they do not like him: Our companions said: His leading the prayer is 
    makrooh if they dislike him because of something that is condemned in 
    sharee’ah, such as an oppressive ruler or one who attains the position of 
    imam by force and does not deserve it, or one who does not take precautions 
    to avoid naajis (impure) things… If no such thing applies then it is not 
    makrooh. … Then he said: When we say that it is makrooh, that is limited to 
    the imam; as for the members of the congregation who do not like him, it is 
    not makrooh for them to pray behind him. 

    Al-Majmoo’, 4/172-173 

    Secondly: 
With regard to replacing 
    him, if you are able to replace him with another imam who is more 
    religiously committed and doing so will not result in a greater evil, then 
    it is better to do that, otherwise it is better to leave him. 

    The evidence that an imam who commits sin openly should not 
    be allowed to lead the prayers is to be found in the report narrated by Abu 
    Dawood (481), which says that a man led some people in prayer and he spat in 
    the qiblah (of the mosque) when the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) was looking on. The Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, when he had finished 
    praying: “He should not lead you in prayer.” After that he wanted to lead 
    them in prayer again, but they did not let him, and they told him what the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had 
    said. He mentioned that to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) and he said: “Yes.” And I (the narrator) think that 
    he said: “You have offended Allaah and His Messenger.” Classed as hasan by 
    al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
This is so long as 
    preventing him from leading the prayers will not lead to a greater evil; if 
    that is the case, then you should pray behind him, and it is not permissible 
    to refrain from praying in congregation because of the evildoing of the 
    imam, as stated above. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If it is 
    possible for a person to prevent a person who commits evil openly from 
    leading the prayer, then he has to do that; but if he has been appointed by 
    someone else and it is not possible to stop him leading the prayers or it is 
    only possible to stop him by means of a greater evil that is more harmful 
    than the evil of the imam who commits evil openly, then it is not 
    permissible to ward off a lesser evil by means of a greater one. Islam came 
    to achieve and complete what is in people’s best interests and to wipe out 
    and reduce evil as much as possible.

46561,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46561,"Revocable divorce, irrevocable divorce and the threefold divorce","I have divorced my wife 20 years ago. Then I took her back before her ‘iddah finished. Years after this I divorced her again saying: “you are divorced, divorced, divorced” my intention then was of the threefold divorce, yet again before her ‘iddah finished I took her back without taking any new procedure i.e. new contract or anything. All I did was that I went to her family’s home and took her back to my home. I thought that the last divorce was revocable. Few months ago I divorced her again. I regretted divorcing her a lot, for many reasons. 
I asked a scholar about my situation and his answer was as follows:   “It is permissible that you took her back after the first divorce, but it is not right that you took her back after the second divorce because it counted as a revocable divorce. Thus you must have made a new marriage contract before she can live with you again.”  
As I took her back without a new contract, this means our marriage was already invalid, so the third time I divorced her is meaningless because it took place when the marriage was already invalid. Thus it becomes permissible for me to take her back if we make a new marriage contract. 
It is a big case and I am very confused. I want to reassure my heart; this is why I sent you my question, because I have great confidence in you. Please enlighten me, may Allah reward you!.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
It is not permissible for anyone to issue a fatwa concerning the religion of Allah without knowledge. Whoever does that has committed a major sin. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say (O Muhammad): (But) the things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are Al‑Fawaahish (great evil sins and every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse) whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in worship) with Allah for which He has given no authority, and saying things about Allah of which you have no knowledge” [al-A’raaf 7:33]. 
The one who gave you a fatwa stating that your taking back your wife after the second divorce was not valid, and that the third divorce did not count and that you had to do the marriage contract in order to take your wife back, was not correct in what he said. This comes under the heading of speaking about Allah without knowledge. The one who gave you this fatwa -- if you have quoted it correctly -- has to repent to Allah and seek His forgiveness, and he has to refrain from giving fatwas, especially those which have to do with honour and bloodshed. 
Secondly: 
Revocable divorce is that in which the husband has the right to take the wife back, without a new marriage contract, dowry or consent of the wife. The divorce in which the husband has the right to take the wife back is the first or second divorce, before the ‘iddah ends. But if the ‘iddah of a first or second divorce ends, it becomes irrevocable in a minor sense, and she cannot go back to her husband unless she agrees and there is a new marriage contract and a new dowry. There is no difference of opinion concerning this among the scholars, and the evidence for it is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “The divorce is twice, after that, either you retain her on reasonable terms or release her with kindness” [al-Baqarah 2:229]. If a third divorce takes place, she is not permissible for him except after she marries another husband in a genuine marriage, then he divorces her or dies after consummating the marriage with her -- and this is the irrevocable divorce in the major sense. The evidence for that is the following verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And if he has divorced her (the third time), then she is not lawful unto him thereafter until she has married another husband. Then, if the other husband divorces her, it is no sin on both of them that they reunite, provided they feel that they can keep the limits ordained by Allah. These are the limits of Allah, which He makes plain for the people who have knowledge” [al-Baqarah 2: 230]. 
Thirdly, 
If we think positively of the person who said that, and assume that he thinks that a thrice-uttered divorce counts as three, then there is no validity in his saying that it is irrevocable divorce in the minor sense, because the thrice-uttered divorce, according to those who say that it counts as three, means that the wife is irrevocable divorced in the major sense. So how can it be permissible for him to say that it is irrevocable divorce in the minor sense and that she may go back to him with a new marriage contract and a new dowry? 
The correct view is that the thrice-uttered divorce counts as one divorce. We have explained that in the answer to question number 96194. It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: At the time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), Abu Bakr and the first two years of ‘Umar’s caliphate, a threefold divorce was counted as one. Narrated by Muslim (1472).  
Fourthly:  
what happened in your case, namely your taking back your wife after the first and second divorce is valid, but by virtue of the third divorce, the wife has become haraam to you and is irrevocably divorced in the major sense; she is a stranger to you and you have to give her her rights in full, and it is not permissible for you to marry her until after she has married another man in a genuine marriage and he leaves her by death or divorce, after consummating the marriage with her. 
With regard to nikaah al-tahleel [a sham marriage aimed at making it permissible for the wife to go back to her first husband] which some people do, it is an invalid marriage which does not make it permissible for the woman to go back to her first husband. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) cursed those who do that.

Because it is mentioned in this website that this puts a person beyond the pale of Islam.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Prayer is the foundation of faith, the mark of the successful, the joy of the righteous. Allaah has prescribed it for the believers, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, As‑Salaah (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours”
[al-Nisa’ 4:103] 
“Successful indeed are the believers.
2. Those who offer their Salaah (prayers) with all solemnity and full submissiveness.
3. And those who turn away from Al‑Laghw (dirty, false, evil vain talk, falsehood, and all that Allaah has forbidden).
4. And those who pay the Zakaah.
5. And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts)
6. Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their right hands possess, - for then, they are free from blame;
7. But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors;
8. Those who are faithfully true to their Amanaat (all the duties which Allaah has ordained, honesty, moral responsibility and trusts) and to their covenants;
9. And those who strictly guard their (five compulsory congregational) Salawaat (prayers) (at their fixed stated hours)”
[al-Mu’minoon 23:1-9] 
Prayer is the first thing for which a person will be brought to account on the Day of Judgement. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The first thing for which a person will be brought to account on the Day of Resurrection is his prayer. If it is sound then he will have succeeded, but if it is not sound he will be doomed.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 413, Abu Dawood, 864; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abu Dawood. 
Allaah erases sins by means of prayer and raises people in status thereby. It is the last religious commitment to be forsaken and if it is neglected then all religious commitment is lost. See question no. 33694. 
My brother, adhere to regular prayer before you die… pray before the funeral prayer is offered for you. 
If you are already praying regularly, then continue to do so. If you have been negligent about prayer, then repent and seek forgiveness before it is too late. Whoever turns to Allaah, Allaah will turn to him. 
Allaah says, according to the hadeeth qudsi: “If he draws near to Me a hand span, I draw near to him an arm’s length, and if he draws near to Me an arm’s length, I draw near to him a fathom’s length, and if he comes to Me walking, I go to him at speed.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7405; Muslim, 2675. 
So repent sincerely to Allaah, and Allaah will accept your repentance. 
Secondly: 
Being careless about prayer and delaying it until the time for it is over with no excuse is a major sin. See question no. 47123. 
Some of the scholars are of the view that the one who omits a single prayer with no excuse until the time for it is over is to be viewed as a kaafir. See question no. 39818. This is the view on which the answer to your question is based, which is the command to the one who omits a single prayer with no excuse until the time for it is over to do ghusl.  
That is because it is prescribed for a kaafir who becomes Muslim to do ghusl, as it is also prescribed for an apostate who returns to Islam. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (1/202): 
If a kaafir becomes Muslim, he has to do ghusl whether he is new to Islam or had apostatized. 
“New to Islam” means one who formerly belonged to another religion all his life, such as a Jew or Christian or Buddhist, etc. 
“Had apostatized” means that he had been a Muslim, then he apostatized from Islam – we ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound from that – such as one who did not pray, or thought that Allaah has a rival or partner, or prayed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) seeking his help at a time of hardship, or prayed to someone else seeking his help in a matter in which he could not help. 
The evidence that ghusl is required in such cases is as follows: 
1 – The hadeeth of Qays ibn ‘Aasim, who said that when he become Muslim the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ordered him to do ghusl using water and lotus leaves. Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 605; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. So the basic principle with regard to this matter is that it is obligatory. 
2 – He has cleansed himself inwardly from the filth of shirk, so wisdom dictates that he should cleanse himself outwardly by doing ghusl. 
Some of the scholars said that he does not have to do ghusl, and they quoted as evidence the fact that no general command was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), such as saying whoever becomes Muslim let him do ghusl, as he said, “Whoever comes to Jumu’ah, let him do ghusl.” How many of the Sahaabah become Muslim but there is no report that he told them to do ghusl or said, whoever becomes Muslim let him do ghusl. If it were obligatory it would have been well known because the people need to know about it. 
We could say that the first view, that ghusl is required, is stronger, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) issued a rule to one member of the ummah for which there is no reason to assume that it applied only to him, so it may be assumed that it applies to the ummah as a whole. The fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) issued the command to one person does not imply that he did not issue the same command to others as well. 
With regard to the fact that it is not narrated from each one of the Sahaabah that he did ghusl when he become Muslim, the fact that there are no reports does not mean that it did not happen, because the basic principle is to do that which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded, and it is not essential for there to be a report from each person who did it. 
Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni: 
If a kaafir becomes Muslim he has to do ghusl, whether he is new to Islam or had apostatized… this is the view of Maalik, Abu Thawr and Ibn al-Mundhir. 
It says in al-Mawso’oah al-Fiqhiyyah (31/206): 
The Maalikis and Hanbalis are of the view that a kaafir’s becoming Muslim necessitates ghusl. If a kaafir becomes Muslim, he must do ghusl. They did not make any distinction between a kaafir who is new to Islam and one who had apostatized. Ghusl is also required of an apostate who comes back to Islam.

46592,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46592,Wishing for Death in Islam: Permissible?,"If a Muslim is faced with many problems in life, and cannot resolve them, is it permissible for him to pray that he may die, so that he will find relief from these problems?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: A long life in which a believer does righteous deeds is better for him than death. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of people is the one who lives long and does good.” Narrated by Ahmad and al-Tirmidhi, 110; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Glad tidings to the one who lives long and does good.” Narrated by al-Tabaraani and Abu Na’eem, classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 3928. 
Ahmad (8195) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Two men became Muslim with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). One of them was martyred, and the other remained for another year. Talhah ibn ‘Ubayd-Allah said: I was shown Paradise (in a dream), and in it I saw that the one who was delayed was admitted before the martyr. I was surprised by that, so the next morning I told the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about that. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Did he not fast Ramadaan after he was gone, and pray six thousand rak’ahs, or such and such a number of rak'ahs, the prayers of one year?” Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 2591. al-‘Ajlooni said in Kashf al-Khafa’: its isnaad is hasan. 
A man said: “O Messenger of Allah, which of the people is best?” He said: “The one who lives long and does good.” He said: “Which of the people is worst?” He said: “The one who lives long and does evil.” Narrated by Ahmad and al-Tirmidhi, 2330; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
Al-Teebi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Time is like the capital of a businessman, and it should be invested in such a way as to make a profit.  The greater the capital, the greater the profit. Whoever benefits from his life by doing good deeds will succeed and prosper, but whoever wastes his capital and does not prosper will evidently lose out. End quote. 
Hence it was said to one of the salaf: Death is a good thing. 
He said: O son of my brother, do not do that, for an hour of life in which you ask Allah for forgiveness is better for you than an eternity of death. 
It was said to an old man among them: Would you not like to die? He said: No, for youth and its evil have gone, and old age and its goodness have come. When I get up, I say Bismillaah (in the name of Allah), and when I sit I say Al-hamdu Lillaah (praise be to Allah), and I would like this to continue. 
Many of the salaf would weep when they were dying, in sorrow for the cessation of their righteous deeds. 
Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade wishing for death, because it deprives the believer of the goodness of obedience and the joy of worship, and of the opportunity to repent and make up for what one has missed. 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one of you should wish for death or pray for it before it comes, for when one of you dies, his good deeds come to an end and for the believer a long life will not increase him in anything but good.” Narrated by Muslim, 2682 
So he mentioned the prohibition of wishing for death alongside the prohibition on praying for one's own death. 
A version narrated by al-Bukhari says: “No one of you should wish for death. Either he is a doer of good and will do more, or he is a doer of evil but perhaps he may stop.” 
Al-Nawawi said: This hadeeth clearly indicates that it is makrooh to wish for death because of some harm that has befallen one, such as loss or distress caused by an enemy, or other such hardships of this world. But if a person fears harm or fitnah with regard to his religious commitment, it is not makrooh to wish for death, according to this hadeeth, and several of the salaf did that. 
There is another reason why wishing for death is not allowed: 
The throes of death are very hard, and the terror of seeing one's end draw nigh is immense. Man is faced with nothing else like it. Moreover, no one knows what awaits him after death. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound. Wishing for death is seeking something which is unknown.  Perhaps if he wishes for death because of some hardship that he has fallen into, he may end up like one who jumps out of the frying pan and into the fire, and after death he may find himself in an even worse situation. In that case, wishing for death is akin to seeking to hasten calamity before it happens. No wise man should do that, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not wish to meet the enemy, and ask Allah to keep you safe and sound.” (Agreed upon). A hadeeth to this effect has been narrated, but it is da’eef (weak).  
It was narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not wish for death, for the terror that follows death is immense. It is a sign of blessing to live long and be guided by Allah to repent.” Narrated by Ahmad; classed as da’eef by al-Albani in Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth al-Da’eefah, 885. 
Ibn ‘Umar heard a man wishing for death and he said: “Do not wish for death, for you are going to die. Ask Allah to keep you safe and sound, for the dying person is exposed to great terror.”  
Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Many righteous men have wished for death when they were healthy, then when it came they hated it because it is so difficult, such as Abu’l-Darda’ and Sufyaan al-Thawri, so what do you think about people other than them? 
Wishing for death, if the reason for it is difficulties in worldly matters, is forbidden because wishing for death in that case is indicative of impatience or panic as a result of the calamity that has befallen. 
It was narrated from Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one of you should wish for death because of some harm that has befallen him, but if he must do that then let him say: ‘O Allah, keep me alive so long as life is good for me, and cause me to die when death is good for me.’” Agreed upon. 
What is meant by “some harm that has befallen him” is worldly harms such as sickness, loss of wealth and children, and the like. But if he fears harm to his religious commitment, such as fitnah, then there is nothing wrong with wishing for death in that case, as we shall see below. 
Perhaps the one who wishes for death in order to find relief from the harm that has befallen him will only increase in exhaustion and pain, he does not know.  
It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: It was said: “O Messenger of Allah, So and so has died, and has found relief.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) got angry and said: “Only the one who is forgiven finds relief.” Narrated by Ahmad, 24192; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 1710. 
Secondly: There are some cases in which it is prescribed to wish for death, such as the following: 
1 – One who fears for his religious commitment because of fitnah 
Undoubtedly death which takes a person away from fitnah (tribulation, temptation that takes one away from religious commitment), even if his righteous deeds are few, is better for him than being subjected to tribulations with regard to his religious commitment. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound. 
It was narrated from Mahmoud ibn Labeed (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are two things that the son of Adam dislikes: death, although death is better for a believer than fitnah; and he dislikes having little wealth, but less wealth means less reckoning.” Narrated by Ahmad; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 813. 
The fact that wishing for death in this situation is also prescribed is  indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in his du’aa’: “If You should decree fitnah for Your slaves, then take my soul (in death) before I am put to trial.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3233; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Jaami’. 
Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This is permissible according to the majority of scholars. 
Based on this, the reports of the salaf wishing for death are to be understood as meaning that they wished for death for fear of fitnah. 
Maalik narrated that Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyab said: When ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab came from Mina, he made his camel kneel at al-Abtah, and then he gathered a pile of small stones and cast his cloak over them and dropped to the ground. Then he raised his hands to the sky and said, 'O Allah! I have become old and my strength has weakened. My flock is scattered. Take me to You with nothing missed out and without having neglected anything.'
Sa’eed said: Dhu’l-Hijjah did not end before ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) was murdered. 
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Whoever sees death offered for sale, let him buy it for me! 
Al-Thabaat ‘inda al-Mamaat, by Ibn al-Jawzi, p. 45 
2 – When his death is martyrdom for the sake of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. 
There are many ahaadeeth which indicate that wishing for death in this case is prescribed, such as the following: 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Were it not that it would be too hard for my ummah, I would not have stayed behind from any campaign. Would that I could be killed for the sake of Allah, then brought back to life then killed, then brought back to life then killed.” Agreed upon.  
The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wished to be killed for the sake of Allah, and that was only because of the great virtue of martyrdom. 
Muslim (1909) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever asks Allah sincerely for martyrdom, Allah will cause him to attain the status of the martyr, even if he dies in his bed.”  
The salaf (may Allah be pleased with them) loved the idea of dying for the sake of Allah. 
Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said, concerning the liar Musaylimah, when he claimed to be a prophet: “By Allah, I will fight him with people who love death as they love life.” 
Khaalid ibn al-Waleed (may Allah be pleased with him) wrote to the people of Persia saying: “By the One besides Whom there is no other god, I shall send against you people who love death as you love life.” 
This status is something desirable – may Allah not deprive us of it – and seeking it is something that is praiseworthy, because the one who is given it will not be deprived of the reward for righteous deeds for which a person may want to live and which may be better for a person than death. Moreover Allah will spare the one who attains this status from the torment of the grave. 
It was narrated that Salmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Standing on guard at the border for one day and one night is better than fasting and praying qiyaam for a month, and if he dies, will be given the reward for the good deeds that he used to do, and he will be given provision, and he will be kept safe from al-fattaan [i.e., Munkar and Nakeer, the two angels who question the deceased in the grave].”  
Muslim, 1913. 
Conclusion: It is makrooh for a Muslim to wish for death if the reason for that is some worldly harm that has befallen him. Rather he must be patient and seek the help of Allah. We ask Allah to grant you relief from the distress that you are suffering.

And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
46595,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46595,Is it permissible to subscribe to the “Tasweeq Net” company?,Is it permissible to subscribe to the “Tasweeq Net (marketing net)” company?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.This company’s activities 
    are similar to those of the “Business” company, and the scholars have stated 
    that it is haraam to subscribe to this company. The “Tasweeq net” company is 
    no different from “Business” apart from the fact that they sell a product 
    that has some value, but the purpose is not the product, rather it is 
    marketing. These companies are based on what is known as “pyramid selling”. 

    Shaykh Saami ibn Ibraaheem al-Suwaylim said: 

    The essential idea behind pyramid selling is simple and may 
    be summed up as follows: a person buys the company’s products in return for 
    the opportunity to convince others to do what he did (i.e., buy the 
    company’s products), and he receives payment or commission in return for 
    that. Then each of these people who joined the program has to convince 
    others to buy as well, and the first one gets increased commission [?] and 
    so on. 

    The reason why it is haraam to join this type of program may 
    be explained by the following points: 

    1 – It is based on consuming wealth unlawfully 

    2 – It is based on ambiguity (and deceit) that is forbidden 
    in sharee’ah. 

    Consuming wealth unlawfully:

    It is clear from the above that this kind of program cannot 
    grow without there being someone who will lose out to the interests of those 
    who profit from it, whether it stops growing or not.  Loss is inevitable for 
    the final levels of the pyramid in all cases, and without it the higher 
    levels cannot gain their astronomical commission. The losers will be in the 
    majority and only a few will profit, i.e., the few will take the wealth of 
    the majority unlawfully. This is consuming wealth unlawfully which the 
    Qur’aan forbids. The economists call this a zero-sum game, whereby what some 
    gain is what the others lose. 

    Ambiguity:

    The basic meaning of the kind of ambiguity that is haraam is 
    paying money in exchange for something which one thinks is most likely not 
    to exist, or may exist in a manner that is not desired. Hence the fuqaha’ 
    said: ambiguity is uncertainty between two things, the most likely of which 
    is the one that the person fears or dislikes most. The one who joins these 
    schemes pays money in return for profits that are unlikely to be realized. 

    Conclusion: 

    Schemes that are based on pyramid selling, including the 
    scheme mentioned in the question, are based on consuming wealth unlawfully 
    and deceiving others, because this pyramid cannot continue forever, and when 
    it stops the result will be that a few will gain at the expense of the 
    majority. The logic of pyramid marketing depends on huge profits for the top 
    levels at the expense of the lower levels of the pyramid, and the last 
    levels will always lose out, even if we assume that the pyramid will never 
    end. The fact that there is a product does not make this scheme permissible, 
    rather this makes it come under the heading of deceit which is haraam. And 
    Allaah knows best. 

    The Shaykh also said concerning the “Tasweeq net” company in 
    particular: 

    The system mentioned in the question is a pyramid marketing 
    system, which may appear in a variety of forms, but may be summed up as 
    being a system where the subscriber persuades others to buy in order to join 
    the marketing scheme. As long as the commission is greater than the price of 
    the product, the aim behind buying is primarily to earn commission; the 
    product is a secondary concern. Based on that, it is not allowed according 
    to sharee’ah because it involves ambiguity and consuming wealth unlawfully, 
    because the subscriber does not know whether he will succeed in convincing 
    others to join or not. If he does succeed, he will be making profit at their 
    expense and the expense of the money they pay to subscribe, and if he does 
    not then he will lose out to the tune of whatever portion of his original 
    payment went towards marketing, and those who joined through him will suffer 
    the same fate, so every level of the pyramid will lose out, unless there is 
    a level or two beneath him who will bear the brunt of the loss, and so on.

46597,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46597,Passing through the Hijr when doing Tawaaf,"Some people enter through the gate of the Hijr when doing tawaaf, and they do not complete tawaaf from outside the Hijr, especially when it is crowded. Is their tawaaf valid?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said: This is a very serious mistake, when some people enter through the 
    gate of the Hijr when doing tawaaf and exit through the other gate when it 
    is crowded, thinking that this is easier. It is a serious mistake because 
    the one who does that is not considered to be doing tawaaf around the 
    Ka’bah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “and circumambulate the Ancient House (the Ka‘bah at 
    Makkah)”

    [al-Hajj 22:29]

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    circumambulated the House from outside the Hijr. If a person circumambulates 
    the Ka’bah going inside the Hijr, he is not regarded as having 
    circumambulated the House, so his tawaaf is invalid. This is a serious 
    matter, especially since tawaaf is a pillar (essential part) of both Hajj 
    and ‘Umrah. The answer to that is that we should explain to the pilgrims 
    that tawaaf is not valid unless it encompasses the entire Ka’bah, including 
    the Hijr. 

    Calling the Hijr “Hijr Ismaa’eel” 

    I would like to take this opportunity to point out that many 
    people call the Hijr “Hijr Ismaa’eel”, but in fact Ismaa’eel had nothing to 
    do with it and it is not his Hijr. Rather this Hijr came into being when 
    Quraysh ran short of cash, when they wanted to rebuild the Ka’bah, and they 
    did not have enough resources to build the Ka’bah on the foundations of 
    Ibraaheem, so they left this side out of it, and it was called hateem 
    and hijr; so Ismaa’eel knew nothing of it and had nothing to do with 
    it. 

    There are some people who do not make sure they keep the 
    Ka’bah on their left, so you see them doing tawaaf with their women folk, 
    and they hold hands with their brothers or friends to protect the women, so 
    you see them doing tawaaf with their back towards the Ka’bah, and his 
    brother or friend doing tawaaf facing towards the Ka’bah. This is also a 
    serious mistake, because the scholars say: One of the conditions of tawaaf 
    being valid is that the Ka’bah should be to one's left, and if you have you 
    back towards it, or face it, or walk with it to your right, then this tawaaf 
    is not valid. 

    What people should do is to pay attention to this matter, and 
    strive to make sure the Ka’bah is to their left throughout tawaaf. 

    There are some people who put their backs to the Ka'bah or 
    face it for a few steps because of the crowding. This is also a mistake. 
    People should be on the safe side with regard to religious matters, and 
    acknowledge the boundaries set by Allaah with regard to worship and avoid 
    mistakes, so that they will worship Allaah with knowledge. 
Does it not astonish you 
    that if a man wants to travel to a land that he does not know, he does not 
    travel until he has asked about it and tried to find out the easiest way to 
    get there, so that he can reach it comfortably and with ease, without 
    getting lost, but when it comes to matters of religion, many people – 
    unfortunately – start their worship and do not know the limits set by 
    Allaah. This is a shortcoming, and indeed is negligence. We ask Allaah to 
    guide us and our Muslim brothers, and to make us among those who know the
