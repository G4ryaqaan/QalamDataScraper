41805,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41805,She has money to furnish the marital home – is zakah due on it?,"My husband gave me a mahr of a certain sum of money, and when I got married my father gave me some more money and we agreed when we did the marriage contract that the two sums together would be used to furnish the marital home according to the prevalent custom in my country. Then my husband and I traveled abroad to work, and we did not furnish our house yet. We left the money in the bank until we go back, then we will furnish our house with it. When I go back to my country each year I get rid of the haraam interest from the bank but my question is: do I have to pay zakah on this money or not?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, you have to pay zakah on this money each year, because zakah is obligatory on money subject to two conditions: 
1-That it reaches the nisaab (minimum threshold at which zakah becomes due)
2-That one full year has passed since acquiring the money
If these two conditions are met, then you have to pay zakah on the money, at a rate of one-quarter of one-tenth, i.e., 2.5%. 
The Standing Committee was asked (9/269):
A man has money and one hijri year has passed since he acquired it, but he saved it in order to get married. Does he have to pay zakah on it? 
They replied: 
He has to pay zakah on it because it is included in the general meaning of the evidence which indicates that zakah is obligatory. The fact that he wants to use it to get married does not mean that the obligation to pay zakah on it is waived. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked about a man who kept some money to buy a house, and one hijri year had passed – does he have to pay zakah on it? 
He replied: 
Yes, he has to pay zakah on it, because zakah is due on money no matter what it is, even if a person prepared it to pay zakah or to buy a house or food; so long as a year has passed and the amount of money reaches the nisaab, then zakah is due on it.

Secondly, this woman needs to stay in order to look after her children, and taking care of children is very important. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A woman is a shepherd in her husband’s house and is responsible for her flock.” So I say that she may wait until next year.

41811,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41811,Meaning of the hadeeth: “Whoever performs Hajj and does not commit any obscenity …”,What is the meaning of the hadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever performs Hajj and does not commit any obscenity or commit any evil will go back (free of) sin as on the day his mother bore him”?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.This hadeeth was narrated by al-Bukhaari (1521) and Muslim (1350) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever performs Hajj and does not commit any obscenity [rafath] or commit any evil will go back (free of) sin as on the day his mother bore him.” 
According to a version narrated by al-Tirmidhi (811): “… his previous sins will be forgiven.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
This hadeeth is like the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“The Hajj (pilgrimage) is (in) the well-known (lunar year) months (i.e. the 10th month, the 11th month and the first ten days of the 12th month of the Islamic calendar, i.e. two months and ten days). So whosoever intends to perform Hajj therein (by assuming Ihraam), then he should not have sexual relations [rafath] (with his wife), nor commit sin, nor dispute unjustly during the Hajj.”
[al-Baqarah 2:197]
The word rafath (translated as “obscenity” above and as “sexual relations” in the meaning of the verse translated above) refers to obscene speech, or to intercourse. 
Al-Haafiz said: 
It seems that what is referred to in the hadeeth is more general than that. This was also the view of al-Qurtubi. It is the same as what is meant in the hadeeth: “When any one of you is fasting, let him not commit any obscenity (fa la yarfuth).” End quote. 
The word rafath in the hadeeth includes both immoral words and immoral intercourse. 
“or commit evil/sin (wa la yafsuq)” means let him not commit any evil action or sin. 
What is meant by “as on the day his mother bore him” means, with no sin.
The apparent meaning is that both major and minor sins are forgiven. This was the view of al-Haafiz. 
It was also the view of al-Qurtubi and al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad. Al-Tirmidhi said: this applies specifically to sins that have to do with the rights of Allaah, not the rights of other people. This was suggested by al-Manaawi in Fayd al-Qadeer. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: What is meant by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “Whoever performs Hajj and does not commit any obscenity or commit any evil will go back (free of) sin as on the day his mother bore him”, is that if a person performs Hajj and avoids rafath, which is intercourse with women, and fusooq which is anything that goes against obedience to Allaah, and he does not fail to do anything that has been enjoined by Allaah, and he does not do anything that has been forbidden by Allaah, then he will emerge from that free of sin, just as when a person emerges from his mother’s womb, there is no sin on him. So if a man performs Hajj and fulfils these conditions, he will be free of sin.
Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 21/20. 
He also said (21/40): The apparent meaning of the hadeeth is that Hajj expiates for major sins, and we cannot go against the apparent meaning unless there is evidence. Some of the scholars said that if the five daily prayers do not expiate for anything unless one avoids major sins, and they are more important and more beloved to Allaah than Hajj, then it is more likely to be the case that Hajj does not expiate for anything unless one avoids major sins. But we say that this is the apparent meaning of the hadeeth and Allaah is Wise in what He does, and we cannot use analogies when discussing the rewards of Allaah. End quote.",Islam Q&A
41833,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41833,How can your Hajj be accepted?,"What are the things that the Muslim should do so that his Hajj will be accepted, in sha Allah?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The things which the Muslim should do so that his Hajj will be accepted are: 
He should have the intention of performing Hajj for the sake of Alah. This is sincerity of intention (ikhlaas). In his Hajj he should follow the way the Messenger of Alah (peace and blessings of Alah be upon him) performed Hajj. This is following (the Sunnah). No righteous deed will be accepted unless it fulfils these two basic conditions: sincerity of intention and following the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Alah be upon him), because Alah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Alah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him), and perform As‑Salaah (Iqaamat‑as‑Salaah) and give Zakaah, and that is the right religion”
[al-Bayyinah 98:5]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Alah be upon him) said: “Actions are but by intentions, and each man will have but that which he intended.” And he (peace and blessings of Alah be upon him) said: “Whoever does an action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam) will have it rejected.” 
This is the most important thing that the pilgrim should seek: sincerity of intention, and following the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Alah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Alah be upon him) used to say during his Hajj: “Learn from me your rituals.” 
Another condition is that Hajj must be done with halaal funds, for Hajj done with haraam funds is haraam and is not permitted. Some of the scholars even said that Hajj is not valid in this case, and one of them said: 
“If you do Hajj with money whose source is haraam, you have not done Hajj but your camel has.” 
Another condition is that he should avoid what Alah has forbidden, because Alah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The Hajj (pilgrimage) is (in) the well-known (lunar year) months (i.e. the 10th month, the 11th month and the first ten days of the 12th month of the Islamic calendar, i.e. two months and ten days). So whosoever intends to perform Hajj therein (by assuming Ihraam), then he should not have sexual relations (with his wife), nor commit sin, nor dispute unjustly during the Hajj”
[al-Baqarah 2:197]
He should avoid whatever Alah has forbidden in general, whether in Hajj or at other times, such as immorality and sin, haraam speech, haraam deeds, listening to music and so on. He should also avoid that which Alah has forbidden particularly in Hajj, such as al-rafath (intercourse with women), and shaving the head. He should also avoid wearing that which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Alah be upon him) forbade us to wear in ihraam. In general, he should avoid everything that is forbidden when in ihraam. 
The pilgrim should also be kind, generous and easy-going with his wealth and in his actions. He should treat his brothers well as much as possible. He must avoid annoying or disturbing the Muslims, in the holy places and marketplaces, or in the crowded conditions of the mataaf (the area around the Ka’bah where tawaaf is performed) and the mas’aa (the place where saa’i is performed) and around the jamaraat, and in others. 
These are all things that are obligatory for the pilgrim, or that he must do. The best way to achieve that is to travel with a knowledgeable person who can remind him about his religion. If that is not possible, then he should read the books of the scholars before going for Hajj, so that he can worship Alah with knowledge. End quote.

He had sold all he had in order to go for Hajj. What is the ruling in this case? Is he regarded as a Hajji?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If a man resolves to do Hajj then dies, he must have died 
    either before entering ihraam or after. 

    If he died before entering ihraam, then Allaah will reward 
    him according to his intention, but the obligatory Hajj of Islam should be 
    performed on his behalf.  

    If he died after entering ihraam, he will have the reward of 
    Hajj, and he will be raised on the Day of Resurrection reciting the 
    Talbiyah. Therefore Hajj should not be performed on his behalf. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was 
    asked about a person who saved money to go for Hajj, but died before he was 
    able to do so. He replied: 

    With regard to this man who resolved to do Hajj and sold all 
    he had in order to go for Hajj, but died before he could perform Hajj, we 
    hope that Allaah will record the reward of the pilgrims for him, because he 
    intended to do a good deed, and he did what he could to prepare for it. 
    Whoever intends to do a good deed and does what he can to prepare for it, it 
    will be recorded for him (as if he did it). Allaah says (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 

    “He who emigrates (from his home) in the Cause of Allaah, 
    will find on earth many dwelling places and plenty to live by. And whosoever 
    leaves his home as an emigrant unto Allaah and His Messenger, and death 
    overtakes him, his reward is then surely, incumbent upon Allaah”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:100]

    If this man had sold all his wealth in order to do Hajj 
    because Hajj is an Islamic duty, then Hajj should be performed on his behalf 
    after his death, using this money that he had prepared, by one of his heirs 
    or by someone else. According to the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him), a woman came to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allaah, my mother vowed to do 
    Hajj but she did not do Hajj before she died. Can I perform Hajj on her 
    behalf?” He said: “Yes.” That was during the Farewell Pilgrimage. End

    He was also asked: A man came from his homeland to perform 
    Hajj, but the plane crashed before reaching (Saudi Arabia). Is he regarded 
    as a hajji? 

    He replied: 

    If a person who is travelling to Hajj dies before setting 
    out, he is not a hajji, but Allaah will reward him for his deeds. If he had 
    entered ihraam and then died, then he is a hajji, because the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said concerning a man whose 
    she-camel broke his neck whilst he was standing in ‘Arafah: “Wash him with 
    water and lotus leaves, and shroud him in his two garments, but do not apply 
    perfumes to him or cover his head, for he will be raised on the Day of 
    Resurrection reciting the Talbiyah.” He did not tell them to make up his 
    Hajj, which indicates that he was a hajji. End quote.

I want to do Hajj on their behalf – should I start with my mother? When I have done Hajj on behalf of one of them, I want to borrow money and delegate someone to perform Hajj on behalf of the other.","You can do Hajj on behalf of your deceased parents, but you should do Hajj on behalf of your mother first, because the mother has more right to be honored than the father.",Mother takes precedence over father with regard to good treatment,"Praise be to Allah.Mother takes precedence over father with regard to good treatment 
The mother’s right to being honoured is greater than the father’s right. 
Al-Bukhari (5971) and Muslim (2548) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, who among the people is most deserving of my good company?” He said, “Your mother.” He said, “Then who?” He said, “Then your mother.” He said, “Then who?” He said, “Then your mother.” He said, “Then who?” He said, “Then your father.” 
Ibn Battal said: 
“What this means is that the mother is entitled to three times more honouring than the father. That is because of the difficulties of pregnancy, then childbirth, then breastfeeding. This is something that applies only to the mother and she goes through suffering because of it. Then the father participates in raising the child. This is also referred to in the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years.” [Luqman 31:14]
The command to be dutiful and good applies equally to both here, but the mother is singled out with regard to these three things. 
Al-Qurtubi said: 
“What is meant is that the mother is entitled to a greater share of her child’s honour, and that takes precedence over the father’s right in the case of conflict.” 
‘Iyad said: 
“The majority are of the view that the mother takes precedence over the father with regard to honour and good treatment. Or it was said that they are equal in this regard. But the former view is the one that is correct.” (Fath al-Bari)
Al-Nawawi said in Sharh Muslim: 
“The reason why the mother is given precedence here is because she puts a great deal of effort into caring for him, shows compassion towards him and serves him. She suffers when she carries him (in her womb), and when she gives birth to him, and when she breastfeeds him, then she brings him up, serves him, nurses him and so on.”
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked a similar question and he replied: 
“Do Hajj on behalf of your mother first , because the mother has more right to be honoured than the father. This has to do with the obligatory Hajj. But if the mother’s Hajj is nafil and the father’s Hajj is obligatory, then start with the obligatory Hajj on behalf of the father. But do not borrow money in order to send someone to perform Hajj on behalf of your father. If next year comes and you are able to do Hajj, then do Hajj on behalf of your father. Doing Hajj on his behalf yourself is better than delegating someone else to do it, because your sincerity towards your father is greater than anyone else’s. Hence we say: it is not permissible for you to borrow money in order to delegate someone to perform Hajj on behalf of your father . Rather you should do Hajj on behalf of your mother this year, so long as you are able to, and next year if you are able to, do Hajj on behalf of your father.” (Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 21/134)",Islam Q&A
41857,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41857,Which is better: standing for a long time or doing more rak‘ahs?,Which is better: standing for a long time or doing more rak‘ahs?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
      The scholars differed concerning this issue, and there are three views. 
      The majority of Hanafis, the Maalikis – according to one view – and the 
      Shaafa‘is, and it is also a view held by some of the Hanbalis, say that 
      standing for a long time is better than increasing the number of rak‘ahs. 

    The Maalikis – according to the view they regard as more correct – and some 
    of the Hanbalis say that it is better to do a lot of bowing and prostrating 
    (rukoo‘ and sujood). 

    The Hanbalis have a third view, which is that the two matters are equal, 
    because of the conflicting reports concerning that. 

    Among the things quoted as evidence by those who say that standing for a 
    long time is better is the hadith of al-Mugheerah ibn Shu‘bah (may Allah be 
    pleased with him), who said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be 
    upon him) used to stand to pray for long that his feet – or his legs – would 
    swell. Something would be said to him, and he would say: “Should I not be a 
    thankful slave?” 

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1078) and Muslim (2819). 

    One of the things quoted as evidence by those who say that doing more 
    rak‘ahs is better is the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, according to which the 
    Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him said: “The 
    closest that a person is to his Lord is when he is prostrating, so say a 
    great deal of du‘aa’.”

    Narrated by Muslim (482). 

    One of the things quoted as evidence by those who held the third view, which 
    is that they are both equal, is the report narrated from Hudhayfah, who 
    said: I prayed with the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) 
    one night, and he started to recite al-Baqarah and I thought: he will bow 
    when he reaches one hundred, but he carried on. Then I thought that he would 
    finish it in the two rak’ahs, but he carried on. Then I thought he would bow 
    after finishing it, but he started to recite al-Nisa’ and recited it all, 
    then he started to recite Aal ‘Imraan and recited it all, reciting with a 
    slow and measured pace. When he reached a verse that spoke of glorifying 
    Allah, he glorified Allah; when he reached a verse that spoke of asking of 
    Him, he asked of Him; when he reached a verse that spoke of seeking refuge 
    with Him, he sought refuge with Him. Then he bowed and started saying, ‘Subhaana 
    Rabbiy al-‘Azeem (Glory be to my Lord the Almighty).” And his bowing was 
    almost as long as his standing. Then he said: “Sam’a Allahu liman hamidah 
    (Allah hears those who praise Him).” Then he stood for a long time, almost 
    as long as he had bowed. Then he prostrated and said, “Subhaan Rabbiy al-A‘la 
    (Glory be to my Lord Most High),” and his prostration was almost as long as 
    his standing.

    Narrated by Muslim, 772 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah regarded the third view as most likely to be 
    correct. He (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 

    The people disputed as to whether it is better to stand for a long time or 
    to do a lot of bowing and prostrating, or are they both equal? There are 
    three views, the soundest of which is that they are both equal. When on 
    stands (during the prayer), one recites Qur’an, which is better than dhikr 
    and du‘aa, but prostration in and of itself is better than standing. So if a 
    person stands for a long time, he should also make his bowing and 
    prostration lengthy. This is the lengthy qunoot which the Prophet (blessings 
    and peace of Allah be upon him) mentioned in his answer when he was asked: 
    Which prayer is best? He said: “Lengthy qunoot.” Narrated by Muslim (756). 
    Qunoot means spending a long time in worship, whether that is when one is 
    standing or bowing or prostrating, as Allah, may He be exalted, says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): “Is one who is obedient (qaanit) to 
    Allah, prostrating himself or standing (in prayer) during the hours of the 
    night…” [az-Zumar 39:9]. Allah describes him as qaanit (translated here 
    as obedient) when he is prostrating, just as He described him as qaanit when 
    he is standing. 

    Al-Fataawa al-Kubra 
    (2/121-122) 

    And he said: 

    The scholars disputed as to which is better: standing for a long time or 
    doing a lot of bowing and prostrating? Or are they both equal? There are 
    three views, all three of which were narrated from Ahmad. It is proven from 
    him (the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) in as-Saheeh 
    that he was asked: Which prayer is best? He said: “Lengthy qunoot”; and it 
    was proven that he said: “you will not perform one prostration to Allah but 
    Allah will raise you one degree in status thereby and erase one sin for you” 
    Narrated by Muslim (488). And he said to Rabee‘ah ibn Ka‘b (who wanted to be 
    with him in Paradise): “Help me to do that for you by prostrating a great 
    deal.”. Narrated by Muslim (489). 
It 
    is well-known that prostration in and of itself is better than standing, but 
    the dhikr of standing is better, because it is recitation of Qur’an. Thus we 
    may conclude that what is best with regard to prayer is to be consistent. So 
    if you make the standing lengthy, you should also make the bowing and 
    prostration lengthy, as the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon 
    him) used to do when he prayed at night, as was narrated by Hudhayfah and 
    others. This is how his obligatory prayers were, as well as the eclipse 
    prayer, and others. His prayer was consistent, so if someone prefers to make 
    his standing, bowing and prostration lengthy, with fewer rak‘ahs, or to keep 
    the standing, bowing and prostration shorter whilst doing a lot of rak‘ahs, 
    these two matters are close in virtue, and the latter may be preferable in 
    some situations. When the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) 
    prayed Duha on the day of the conquest of Makkah, he prayed eight brief 
    rak‘ahs, and he did not limit it to two lengthy rak‘ahs. The Sahaabah also 
    did that when praying qiyaam in Ramadaan, so as not to cause hardships to 
    the people praying behind them by making the standing lengthy.

We hope that you can explain this hadeeth. I know that Allaah is called al-Haashir and He is the One Who will gather the people for the Reckoning on the Day of Resurrection. I hope that you can clarify this matter. May Allaah reward you with good and place this in balance of your good deeds.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    This hadeeth – “I am the Gatherer at whose feet the people 
    will gather” – is one upon which the two Shaykhs (al-Bukhaari and Muslim) 
    are agreed. The hadeeth in full is as follows: The Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I have several names. I 
    am Muhammad and I am Ahmad and I am al-Maahi (the Eraser) by means of whom 
    Allaah erases (yamhu) kufr, and I am al-Haashir (the Gatherer) at whose feet 
    the people will gather, and I am al-‘Aaqib (the successor, i.e., the one who 
    succeeds the other Prophets in bringing about good, or the Last Prophet).” 
    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4896; Muslim, 2354. 

    With regard to the phrase “I am the Gatherer at whose feet 
    the people will gather”, what this means is that they will be gathered after 
    him, and he will be gathered before the people. This is in accordance with 
    what he said in another hadeeth: “The people will be gathered at my heels.” 
     

    It is possible that what is referred to by feet (qadam) is 
    time, i.e., my era when my mission starts, when the signs of the gathering 
    begin to appear, referring to the fact that there will be no Prophet after 
    him. This was suggested by al-Haafiz in al-Fath, 6/557.

    Ibn al-Qayyim said in Zaad al-Ma’aad (1/94): It is as 
    if he was sent to gather the people. 

    Secondly: Your saying that Allaah is also called al-haashir 
    is not correct, because the names of Allaah are determined by the texts of 
    the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and there is no room for human reasoning with regard 
    to them. We must accept what has been narrated in the Qur’aan and Sunnah and 
    not add anything or take anything away. 

    1 – Because human reason cannot encompass the names that 
    Allaah deserves, so we must accept what the texts say, because Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And follow not (O man, 
    i.e., say not, or do not, or witness not) that of which you have no 
    knowledge. Verily, the hearing, and the sight, and the heart of each of 
    those ones will be questioned (by Allaah)”

    [al-Isra’ 17:36] 

    “Say (O Muhammad): (But) the things that my Lord has 
    indeed forbidden are Al‑Fawaahish (great evil sins and every kind of 
    unlawful sexual intercourse) whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of 
    all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in worship) with 
    Allaah for which He has given no authority, and saying things about Allaah 
    of which you have no knowledge”

    [al-A’raaf 7:33]

    2 – Because calling Him by a name by which He has not called 
    Himself, or denying one of the names by which He has called Himself is a 
    transgression against His rights. We must observe proper etiquette in this 
    matter and limit ourselves to those names that have been mentioned in the 
    texts. 

    3 – The attributes of Allaah are greater than His names, 
    because each name refers only to one attribute. For example, one of His 
    names is al-Samee’ (the All-Hearing). This name affirms that al-Samee’ is a 
    name of Allaah and affirms that He possesses the attribute of hearing. 

    With regard to the actions that are attributed to Allaah, 
    they do not include the names of Allaah, because they are connected to His 
    actions, and His actions have no end (or limit). Among the actions that are 
    attributed to Allaah are coming, taking, withholding and striking, as He 
    says:  

    “And your Lord comes with the angels in rows”

    [al-Fajr 89:22] 

    “Do they then wait for anything other than that Allaah 
    should come to them in the shadows of the clouds and the angels?”

    [al-Baqarah 2:210] 

    “So Allaah seized (destroyed) them for their sins”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:11] 

    “He withholds the heaven from falling on the earth except 
    by His Leave”
    [al-Hajj 22:65] 
“Verily, (O Muhammad) the 
    Seizure (punishment) of your Lord is severe and painful”

    [al-Burooj 85:12]

    These things are attributed to Allaah in the way in which 
    they are mentioned in the Qur’aan, but we do not call Him by them, so we do 
    not say that among his names are “the Comer” or “the Seizer” or “the 
    Withholder” etc, but we say about Him and attribute that (action) to Him.

41869,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41869,A communist atheist is claiming that fasting is harmful,"I live in Russia where I am studying. Most of our professors are communists who do not believe in the existence of the Creator. One of them said to us: “How can this God of yours command you not to eat and drink during the day when this is damaging to the health?” How do you advise us to respond to this communist, may Allaah humiliate him?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Fasting – as well as being basically an act of worship that is prescribed in Islam and an obligation enjoined by Allaah, is also one of the most beneficial of remedies and most effective means of strengthening one’s body. This is according to the testimony of non-Muslim doctors, let alone Muslim ones. 
Fasting plays an effective role in treating psychological problems and strengthening the will-power of the fasting person, softening his feelings, and making him love to do good and keep away from argumentative and hostile tendencies; it also increases his spiritual feelings. So it strengthens his personality and makes him more able to bear problems and burdens. Undoubtedly this is reflected positively in a person’s health. 
This is one aspect. From another angle, fasting also plays a role in treating many physical disorders, such as diseases of the digestive system like gastritis, irritable bowel syndrome, liver diseases and indigestion, as well as treating obesity, hardening of the arteries, high blood pressure, angina, asthma, etc. 
The Swiss doctor Barcellus wrote: 
The benefit of hunger as a remedy is many times better than using medicines. Doctor Helb used to forbid his patients to eat for several days, then he would offer them light meals. In general, fasting plays a role in destroying the worn-out tissues at the time of hunger, then rebuilds them when food is ingested. This is the reason why some scientists, including Pashutin, regard fasting as a means of restoring youth. 
Tom Burns of the Columbia School of Journalism says: I regard fasting as an experience which is deeply spiritual more than physical. Despite the fact that I started to fast with the aim of losing excess weight, I realized that fasting is very beneficial for the mind. It helps me to see with greater clarity and to develop new thoughts and to focus my feelings. Within only a few days of starting my fast in the spa I began to feel that I was passing through a very spiritual experience. 
Of course fasting may be harmful and extremely difficult for some people in certain situations; Allaah has exempted them from fasting – such as those who are sick and those who are traveling. 
Moreover the benefits of fasting come when one adheres to the etiquette of fasting, such as delaying suhoor, hastening to break the fast, not being extravagant in the manner or amount of food eaten, and avoiding being extravagant in serving a large variety of foods. 
The Encyclopaedia Britannica says: Most religions enjoin fasting and it it is something that people used to do even at times other than religious occasions; some individuals fast in response to human nature.  
In the twentieth century a number of books appeared in America and Europe which spoke of the medical benefits of fasting. There was Treating sickness by fasting by Shelton; Medical Fasting: The Ideal Nutritional System by Alan Coutt; Fasting, the Elixir of Life by Enrique Tanner; Return to a Healthy Life through Medical Fasting by Watzener. 
Fasting is of great benefit in treating some diseases of the heart, because 10% of the blood that the heart pumps to the body goes to the digestive system during the digestive process; this amount is reduced during fasting, when the digestive process does not occur during the day. This means that the heart works less and can rest more. 
Fasting is also used to treat skin diseases, because if the amount of water in the blood is reduced, the amount of water in the skin is also reduced. 
It increases the skin’s impermeability and resistance to bacterial disease. 
It reduces the extent of skin diseases that can spread over a large area of the body such as psoriasis. 
It reduces allergies and other skin problems.  
Fasting reduces toxic secretions in the intestines and reduces the fermentation that can lead to ulcers. 
These are some of the health benefits of fasting, from which you may understand that what that communist atheist says has no sound basis. 
Moreover we fast in obedience to the command of Allaah Who has enjoined us to fast, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious”
[al-Baqarah 2:183]
If Allaah commanded us to kill ourselves we would do it in order to please our Lord, but we believe with certainty of faith that He would never command us to do anything but that which is in our best interests in this world and in the Hereafter.

    The most correct scholarly view is that it is obligatory to 
    do Hajj straightaway, and it is not permissible to delay it without a 
    legitimate shar’i excuse, because you do not know what will happen to you. 
    You may delay Hajj this year and then die, and Hajj will remain a debt that 
    you owe. But if doing Hajj will affect your performance in the exams, then 
    you may delay it until next year. But I suggest taking your study materials 
    with you and going for Hajj, if you are going to travel to Hajj early. Or 
    you can delay travelling to Hajj and hasten to leave during the days of 
    stoning the Jamaraat. In this way Hajj will only take a few days and it will 
    not affect your exams in sha Allaah. 

    If a person is keen, he can do Hajj, and that will not affect 
    him at all. If you put your trust in Allaah and perform Hajj with trust in 
    Him, He will make things easy for you. End quote.

Does she have to do the farewell tawaaf?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The people who live in Makkah do not have to do the farewell tawaaf, because this tawaaf is required in order to bid farewell to the House, which does not apply in the case of those who live in Makkah, because it is their home. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said, explaining that the farewell tawaaf is not one of the essential parts of Hajj which must be done: 
… Therefore the people who live in Makkah do not have to do tawaaf al-qudoom (tawaaf of arrival) or tawaaf al-wadaa’ (farewell tawaaf), because that does not make sense in their case; they are not coming from elsewhere and they are not bidding farewell so long as they live there.
Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 26/261 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The people of Makkah do not have to do the farewell tawaaf. Al-Fatawa, 17/393. 
This includes everyone who is inside the boundaries of the sanctuary (al-haram). Ibn Qudaamah said: Everyone whose home is within in the Haram is like a Makkan and does not have to do the farewell tawaaf. Al-Mughni, 3/237.
 But if a person who lives in Makkah wants to travel after doing the rituals of Hajj or ‘Umrah, then he has to do the farewell tawaaf before leaving Makkah. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Our companions said: whoever has finished his rituals and wants to stay in Makkah, does not have to do the farewell tawaaf. There is no scholarly difference of opinion on this point, whether he is one of its inhabitants or a stranger. If he wants to leave Makkah and go back to his country or somewhere else, then he has to do the farewell tawaaf. Al-Majmoo’, 8/254. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a man is one of the inhabitants of Makkah, and he does Hajj then travels after Hajj, then he should do the farewell tawaaf, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “None of you should leave until the last thing he does is to circumambulate the House.” Muslim, 1327. This is general in application. So we say to this person who lives in Makkah: So long as you are travelling during the days of Hajj, and you have done Hajj, then do not leave until you have done tawaaf. Al-Fatawa, 23/339. 
Based on this, then the lady who asked this question has to do the farewell tawaaf when she wants to travel, after she has done the rituals of Hajj. And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A

Both men and women can act as deputies on behalf of others.",,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, it is permissible for a woman to do Hajj on behalf of a man. 
Al-Bukhari (1513) and Muslim (1334) narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A woman from Khath-am came and said: “Allah’s command to the people to perform Hajj has come when my father is an old man and cannot sit firmly in the saddle. Can I perform Hajj on his behalf?” He (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) said: “Yes.” That was during the Farewell Pilgrimage.
Ibn Hazm said in al-Muhalla (5/317): 
“It is permissible for a woman to perform Hajj on behalf of a man or a woman , and for a man to perform Hajj on behalf of a woman or a man, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded the Khath-ami woman to perform Hajj on behalf of her father, and he commanded a man to perform Hajj on behalf of his mother, and another man to perform Hajj on behalf of his father. There is no text which forbids any of that. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “and do good” [al-Hajj 22:77], and this is good. It is permissible for everyone to do it on behalf of everyone.”
Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni (5/27): 
“It is permissible for a man to be appointed to do Hajj on behalf of a man or a woman , and a woman on behalf of a man or a woman, according to the majority of scholars. We do not know of any difference of opinion, except al-Hasan ibn Salih, who regarded it as makruh for a woman to do Hajj on behalf of a man. Ibn al-Mundhir said: this is a failure to recognize the apparent meaning of the Sunnah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded a woman to do Hajj on behalf of her father.”
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: is it permissible for a woman to do Hajj on behalf of her father even if she has brothers who are grown up? 
He replied: 
“It is permissible for a woman to do Hajj on behalf of her father , even if she has brothers who are grown up. Both men and women can act as deputies on behalf of others . Hence the woman from Khath-am asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)… And he quoted the hadith mentioned above, then he said: He (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) gave her permission to do Hajj, and she was a woman acting on behalf of a man. But it is essential for her to have a mahram on every journey, whether that is for Hajj or for any other purpose, and whether the woman is travelling to do Hajj for herself or on behalf of someone else.” (Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 21/247)

41899,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41899,How Old Should the Udhiyah Be?,Is there a specific age for the sacrificial animal? Is it permissible to slaughter a cow as a sacrifice when it is one and a half years old?,"The Shar`i evidence indicates that a sheep that has reached the age of six months may count as a sacrifice, as may a goat that has reached the age of one year, a cow that has reached the age of two years, and a camel that has reached the age of five years. Sacrificing an animal that is younger than that is not permitted, but if an animal that is older than that is sacrificed, it is permitted and is better.","Can you slaughter animals that are younger than the recommended age?


Recommended age of sacrificial animal","Praise be to Allah.Can you slaughter animals that are younger than the recommended age?
The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) agree that Islam has prescribed the age for sacrificial animals and it is not permissible to slaughter animals that are younger than that. Whoever slaughters an animal that is younger than that, it does not count as a sacrifice. (See al-Majmu’ by al-Nawawi, 1/176) 
For example, al-Bukhari (5556) and Muslim (1961) narrated that al-Bara ibn ‘Azib (may Allah have mercy on him) said: A maternal uncle of mine whose name was Abu Burdah slaughtered his sacrifice before the prayer, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Your sheep is a sheep for meat (i.e., not a sacrifice).” He said: “O Messenger of Allah, I have a young goat (according to another report: I have a young she-goat) (according to a report by al-Bukhari (5563): I have a jadha’ah which is better than two musinnahs – shall I sacrifice it?)” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Sacrifice it, but that will not be valid for anyone but you.” According to another report, “It will not count for anyone after you.” Then he said: “Whoever slaughters (the animal) before the prayer has slaughtered it for himself, and whoever slaughters it after the prayer has offered the sacrifice and followed the way of the Muslims.” 
This hadith indicates that a jadha’ah of goats (young goat) is not sufficient as a sacrifice. We will explain below what jadha’ah means. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said in Tahdhib al-Sunan: 
“The phrase “It will not count for anyone after you” is a definitive statement that it would not count for anyone after him.”
Muslim (1963) narrated that Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not slaughter anything but a musinnah, unless it is too hard for you, in which case you should slaughter a young sheep (jadha’ah min al-dan). 
This hadith also clearly states that only a musinnah can be slaughtered, except in the case of sheep, where a jadha’ah may be offered. 
Al-Nawawi said in Sharh Muslim: 
“The scholars said:   
A musinnah is a thaniyyah of anything, camel, cow or sheep, or anything over that age. This clearly indicates that it is not permissible to slaughter a jadha’ah of any animal in any circumstances, except sheep.” 
Al-Hafiz said in al-Talkhis, 4/285: 
“The apparent meaning of the hadith suggests that a jadha’ah of sheep is not permissible except if one cannot find a musinnah. Scholarly consensus says something different, so this hadith should be understood as referring to what is better. So it is mustahabb not to slaughter anything but a musinnah.”
Al-Nawawi said the same in Sharh Muslim. 
It says in ‘Awn al-Ma’bud: 
“This interpretation is the one which is correct.”
Then he quoted some of the hadiths which indicate that it is permissible to offer a jadha’ah of sheep as a sacrifice, such as the hadith of ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “We slaughtered a jadha’ah of sheep with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” Narrated by al-Nasai, 4382. al-Hafiz said: Its isnad is qawiy (strong). It was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Nasai. 
It says in al-Maws’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (5/83) concerning the conditions of udhiyah : 
“The second condition is that it should have reached the age of sacrifice , by being a thaniyyah or older in the case of camels, cows and goats, and jadha’ah or older in the case of sheep. A sacrifice does not count if the animal is younger than a thaniyyah except in the case of sheep, or if it is sheep that is younger than a jadha’ah…. The jurists agreed upon this condition, but they differed as to what is meant by thaniyyah and jadha’ah.”
Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“I do not know of any dissent with the view that a jadha’ah of goats or anything else that is offered as a sacrifice apart from sheep is not permissible. Rather it is permissible to sacrifice a thaniyyah or anything older than of all of these. It is permissible to sacrifice a jadha’ah of sheep according to the Sunnah.” (Tartib al-Tamhid, 10/267. 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu’ (8/366): 
“The ummah is agreed that with regard to camels, cows and goats, nothing will do except a thaniyyah, and with regard to sheep, nothing will do but a jadha’ah, and that these are all acceptable. But some of our companions narrated that Ibn ‘Umar and al-Zuhri said: A jadha’ah of sheep does not count. It was narrated from ‘Ata and al-‘Awza’i that a jadha’ah of camels, cows, goats and sheep does count.”
Recommended age of sacrificial animal
With regard to the stipulated age of sacrificial animals, the scholars differed concerning that. 
A jadha’ah of sheep is a sheep that has reached the age of six months, according to the Hanafis and Hanbalis. According to the Malikis and Shafi’is it is a sheep that has reached the age of one year. 
The musinnah (or thaniyyah) of goats is one that has reached the age of one year according to the Hanafis, Malikis and Hanbalis. According to the Shafi`is, it is one that has reached the age of two years. 
The musinnah of cows is one that has reached the age of two years according to the Hanafis, Shafi’is and Hanbalis; according to the Malikis it is one that has reached the age of three years. 
The musinnah of camels is one that has reached the age of five years according to the Hanafis, Malikis, Shafi'is and Hanbalis. 
(See Badai’ al-Sanai’, 5/70; al-Bahr al-Raiq, 8/202; al-Taj wa’l-Iklil, 4/363; Sharh Mukhtasar Khalil, 3/34; al-Majmu’, 8/365; al-Mughni, 13/368) 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ahkam al-Udhiyah: 
“The thaniyyah of camels is one that has reached the age of five years. The thaniyyah of cows is one that has reached the age of two years. The thaniyyah of sheep is one that has reached the age of one year. The jadha’ah is one that has reached the age of half a year. It is not acceptable to offer anything younger than a thaniyyah in the case of camels, cows and goats, or anything younger than a jadha’ah in the case of sheep.” 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah (11/377): 
“The shar’i evidence indicates that a sheep that has reached the age of six months may count as a sacrifice, as may a goat that has reached the age of one year, a cow that has reached the age of two years, and a camel that has reached the age of five years.  Anything younger than that does not count as a hadiy or udhiyah . This is what the Quran refers to when it says (interpretation of the meaning): “sacrifice a Hady (animal, i.e. a sheep, a cow, or a camel) such as you can afford” [al-Baqarah 2:196], because the texts of the Quran and Sunnah explain one another.” 
Al-Kasani said in Badai’ al-Sanai’ (5/70): 
“These ages, as defined in Shari`ah, are minimum ages, not maximum ages. Sacrificing an animal that is younger than that is not permitted, but if an animal that is older than that is sacrificed, it is permitted and is better. It is not permitted to sacrifice a lamb, kid (young goat), calf or young camel, because the ages of animals that we have mentioned were narrated in shari’ah and these were not mentioned among them.’
So it is clear that slaughtering a cow that is younger than two years old will not count as a sacrifice according to any of the imams.
