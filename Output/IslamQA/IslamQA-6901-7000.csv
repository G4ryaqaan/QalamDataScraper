6906,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6906,Children wearing short clothes,"Some women – may Allaah guide them – dress their young daughters in short clothes which show the calves. When we advise these mothers, they say, “We used to dress like this and it did not affect us when we grew up.” What do you think about this?",,,"Praise be to Allah.I think that a person should not let his or her daughter wear such clothes when she is little, because if she gets used to wearing such clothes when she is little, she will continue to do so when she gets older, and it will not be such a big issue for her. But if she gets used to dressing modestly from a young age, she will continue to dress modestly when she gets older. What I advise our Muslim sisters to do is to shun the clothing of foreigners who are the enemies of our religion and to get their daughters used to wearing covering clothes and to the idea that modesty is part of religion.","fataawa of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen in al-Da’wah magazine, no. 1709, p. 35"

At the same time as we are hearing of some Muslims who spend most of their time away from their families – whether for da’wah or for travelling or some other permissible purpose – we are also hearing of the opposite, where some people stay with their families all the time and never devote any time to calling others to Allaah.
Just as a man’s family has rights over him that he should not neglect, other people, Muslims and non-Muslims – also have rights over him which he should not ignore..
It was reported from al-Hasan that ‘Ubayd-Allaah ibn Ziyaad visited Ma’qil ibn Yassaar during his final illness. Ma’qil said to him, I will tell you a hadeeth which I heard from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say:
“There is no person to whom Allaah has given people to take care of, and he fails to take care of them properly, but he will not smell the fragrance of Paradise.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6731; Muslim, 142)
‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
“Each of you is a shepherd and each of you will be questioned [about those under his care]. The leader is a shepherd and will be questioned. A man is the shepherd of his family and will be questioned. A woman is the shepherd of her husband’s house and she will be questioned. A slave is the shepherd of his master’s wealth and will be questioned. Each of you is a shepherd and each of you will be questioned [about those under his care].”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4892; Muslim, 1829).
Many women wish that their husbands would not go out and leave them, not even to pray (in the mosque)! So how about to call people to Allaah? A woman said in the past: Three co-wives would be easier for me than my husband’s library! Because her husband was fond of learning and reading.
So she should not be given everything she wants; the matter should be referred to what Allaah loves and wants.
In the case of some acts of worship, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us not to go beyond what is prescribed in sharee’ah, for fear that the rights of others – above all the family – may be affected because of that. A number of ahaadeeth were narrated concerning this matter, such as:
‘Awn ibn Abi Juhayfah narrated that his father said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) established brotherhood (mu’aakhah) between Salmaan and Abu’l-Dardaa’. Salmaan visited Abu’l-Dardaa’ and noticed that Umm al-Dardaa’ appeared scruffy and unkempt (this was before the aayah of hijaab was revealed). He said to her, What is the matter with you? She said, Your brother Abu’l-Dardaa’ has no need of this world. Then Abu’l-Dardaa’ came (to visit him). He made some food for him, and said, Eat. [Abu’l-Dardaa’] said, I am fasting. [Salmaan] said, I will not eat until you eat. So he ate. When night came, Abu’l-Dardaa’ went to pray qiyaam, but [Salmaan] said to him, Sleep, so he slept. Then he wanted to get up for qiyaam, but [Salmaan] said, Sleep. When the last part of the night came, Salmaan said, Now get up. So they prayed, then Salmaan said to him, Your Lord has a right over you, your soul has a right over you and your wife has a right over you, so give each one his due. He [Abu’l-Dardaa’] went to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and told him about that. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Salmaan is right.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1867).
‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to me, “O ‘Abd-Allaah, have I not heard that you fast all day and pray all night?” I said, yes, O Messenger of Allaah. He said, “Do not do that. Fast and break your fast, pray qiyaam and sleep, for your body has a right over you, your eyes have a right over you, your wife has a right over you and your visitors have a right over you. It is sufficient for you to fast three days of every month. For every good deed (hasanah) you will be rewarded tenfold, so that will be like fasting for an entire lifetime.” But I went to extremes and made things hard for myself. I said, O Messenger of Allaah, I can do more than that. He said, “Then observe the fast of the Prophet of Allaah, Dawood (peace be upon him), and no more.” I said, What is the fast of the Prophet of Allaah, Dawood (peace be upon him)? He said, “Half a lifetime.” After he grew old, ‘Abd-Allaah used to say, I wish that I had taken the easier option which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) offered me.
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1874; Muslim, 1159).
In these ahaadeeth you can see how the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) advised moderation in fasting, praying qiyaam and reading Qur’aan – for those who were doing a lot and neglecting their families’ rights. He was drawing attention to the rights of others, including wives and families.
Whoever organizes his time and pays due attention to everyone who has a right over him, should not worry about who is happy and who is not. Do not let da’wah activities take over your life and occupy all your time, but do not listen to your wife and give them up altogether.
One of the things that may help you is to get your wife involved in da’wah activities. Ask her to listen to a tape and summarize it, or to read a book and write down what she has learnt from it, or ask her to attend a study circle or take part in women’s da’wah activities at the Islamic centre or attend women’s seminars held in parallel with the men’s seminars, etc., so that she will feel that she is sharing these activities with you, and she will not feel bored because her husband is away.
Another issue to bear in mind is that you have to help her to understand that she will have a share in the reward if she is patient with you and creates the right atmosphere for you to learn and engage in da’wah. The Sahaabiyyaat (women of the Sahaabah) used to take care of their husband’s houses and children when the men went out for jihaad; they would serve their husband’s guests when they came to visit. If a woman takes care of her husband’s house when he goes out to seek knowledge or engage in da’wah or jihaad, and she serves the seekers of knowledge and daa’iyahs who come to visit him by honouring them and preparing food for them, then she will have a great reward for that. Allaah may admit three people to Paradise because of a single arrow: the one who makes it with a good intention and the one who hands it over – not just the one who shoots it. If a wife understands and remembers this, it will make it much easier for her to bear it when her husband is absent or busy.
We will end with the story of a great woman, Asmaa’ bint Abi Bakr As-Siddeeq, and see what she used to do when her husband was busy with jihaad and da’wah and taking care of the affairs of the Islamic state with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him):
Asmaa’ bint Abi Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: I got married to al-Zubayr and he owned nothing in this world apart from a camel for carrying water and a horse. I used to feed his horse, and bring water, and prepare his saddle, and make dough, but I was not good at baking; some women of the Ansaar who were my neighbours used to bake my bread for me, and they were good women. I used to bring the dates from some land which the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had given to al-Zubayr, carrying them on my head. (The land) was two-thirds of a farsakh [parasang=approx. 3 miles] away. One day I was coming with the dates on my head, and I met the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with a group of the Ansaar. He called me and made his camel kneel down so that I could ride behind him. But I felt too shy to go with the men, and I remembered al-Zubayr and how jealous he was, for he was the most jealous of men. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) realized that I felt too shy, so he went on his way. I came to al-Zubayr and told him that I had met the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) whilst I was carrying the dates on my head, and there was a group of his companions with him. He made his camel kneel down so that I could ride on it, but I felt too shy, because I remembered your jealousy. He said, By Allaah, your having to carry the dates is harder for me than your riding with him. Later on, Abu Bakr sent a servant who took care of the horse, and it was as if I had been set free from slavery.

6942,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6942,Choosing a husband,"What are the most important factors for a woman in choosing a husband? If she rejects a righteous man for some worldly reasons, will she be punished by Allah?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The most important factors for a woman in choosing a husband are his attitude/behaviour and his commitment to religion. Wealth and lineage are secondary matters. The most important thing is that the potential husband should be religious and have a good attitude, because if a man has religious commitment and a good attitude, a woman has nothing to lose: if he keeps her (remains married to her), he will keep her on a reasonable basis, and if he divorces her, he will set her free on a reasonable basis. Moreover, a man who is religious and has a good attitude will be a blessing to her and her children, for they will learn good manners and religion from him. But if the prospective husband is not like that (is not religious), she should keep away from him, especially those who take the matter of prayer lightly or who are known to drink alcohol. We seek refuge with Allah.
As for those who do not pray at all, they are kuffaar and it is not permissible for them to marry believing women. It is important for the woman to focus on the matter of attitude and religious commitment. With regard to the matter of lineage, this is a bonus. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If there comes to you (to propose marriage to your daughter etc.) a man with whose religious commitment and attitude you are pleased, then marry (your daughter) to him.”
But if you can manage to ensure compatibility (in terms of lineage and socio-economic status, etc.) as well, then this is better.","From the Fataawa of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, from the book Fataawa al-Mar’ah"

On this basis, she should not stop doing acts of worship, but she should fast and pray.

With regard to washing the clothes, there is no basis for doing so in the Sunnah, and it is neither obligatory nor recommended.",,"Praise be to Allah.The correct scholarly view is that doing Ghusl after washing the deceased is recommended, but it is not obligatory. 
This is the view of Ibn `Abbas, Ibn `Umar, `Aishah, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i, Ash-Shafi`i, Ahmad, Ishaq, Abu Thawr, Ibn Al-Mundhir and others, and it is also the view regarded as most correct by Ibn Qudamah. (See Sunan At-Tirmidhi, 3/318; Al-Mughni, 1/134) 
Shaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“It is recommended for the one who washes the deceased to do Ghusl , because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever washes the dead, let him do Ghusl, and whoever carries him, let him do Wudu.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 2/62-63; At-Tirmidhi, 2/132. Some of its isnads (chains of narration) are good, and some are authentic according to the conditions of Muslim. Ibn Al-Qayyim quoted eleven isnads for it in Tahdhib As-Sunan, then he said: These isnads indicate that the Hadith is mahfudh (preserved). 
I say: it was classed as authentic by Ibn Al-Qattan, and by Ibn Hazm in Al-Muhalla, 1/250 and 2/23-25, and by Al-Hafidh in At-Talkhis, 2/134 (Muniriyyah edition). And he said, at the very least it is good. 
The apparent meaning of the Hadith indicates that it is a must, but we did not suggest that it is a must because of two mawquf hadiths that are to be taken as marfu`: 

From Ibn `Abbas: “When you wash your dead you do not have to do Ghusl afterwards, for your dead are not impure. It is sufficient for you to wash your hands.” (Narrated by Al-Hakim, 1/386; Al-Bayhaqi, 3/398)

It seems to me most likely that this Hadith is mawquf, as I have explained in Ad-Da`ifah, 6304. 

Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “We used to wash the deceased, and some of us would do Ghusl afterwards and others would not.” (Narrated by Ad-Daraqutni, 191; Al-Khatib in his Tarikh, 5/424, with an authentic isnad as Al-Hafidh said. This was also referred to by Imam Ahmad. Al-Khatib narrated from him that he urged his son to write down this Hadith.” (Ahkam Al-Jana’iz, 71. 72) 

This is what is regarded as most likely to be correct by the Standing Committee (1/318), and by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin in Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 1/295 
With regard to washing the clothes, there is no basis for doing so in the Sunnah, and it is neither obligatory nor recommended.

    “but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part

    made it lawful).”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:4]

    Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    The phrase “but if they, of their 
    own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it, and enjoy it 
    without fear of any harm” is addressed to 
    husbands, and indicates that it is permissible for a woman to give her mahr 
    as a gift to her husband, whether she was a virgin or previously married. 
    This is the opinion of the majority of fuqaha’… The scholars are agreed that 
    if a woman who is in control of her own affairs gives her mahr to her 
    husband, that is a valid transaction and she cannot take it back.  

    Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 5/24, 25 
In general, if a kaafir 
    gives something to a Muslim “of his own good pleasure”, there is nothing 
    wrong with accepting it. 

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    ate with the Jews. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2424; Muslim, 4060) 

    The king of Aylah – a land on the seacoast – who was a kaafir, 
    gave him a gift of a white mule and a cloak. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1411; 
    Muslim, 1392). 

    The Negus paid the mahr of Umm Habeebah on his behalf, and he 
    was a kaafir. 

    It was narrated from Umm Habeebah that the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) proposed marriage to 
    her when she was in the land of Ethiopia. The Negus married her to the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), giving her on his 
    behalf her a mahr of four thousand dirhams, and prepared her trousseau, and 
    he sent her (to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him)) with Shurahbeel ibn Hasanah. The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not send anything to her. The mahr of 
    his wives was four hundred dirhams. 

    (Narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 3350; Abu Dawood, 2086; al-Haakim, 
    2/181. al-Haakim classed it as saheeh and al-Dhahabi agreed with him). 

    And there are many other similar incidents. 

    2 – If she wills her possessions to you, and she was 
    following her own religion before she died, it is also permissible for you 
    to take these possessions, because a will is different from inheritance. But 
    if she did not make a will and died, then it is not permissible for you to 
    inherit anything from her. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said: “The Muslim does not inherit from a kaafir and the kaafir 
    does not inherit from a Muslim.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6383; Muslim, 
    1614). 

    Imam Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
It is proven from the 
    narrations of the trustworthy imaams that the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “The Muslim does not inherit from the 
    kaafir.” So everyone who goes against that, this hadeeth is evidence against 
    him. This is the view of  all the Sahaabah, Taabi’een and fuqaha’ of various 
    regions such as Maalik, al-Layth, al-Thawri, al-Awzaa’i, Abu Haneefah, al-Shaafa’i 
    and all the scholars of hadeeth who spoke on matters of fiqh, that a Muslim 
    should not inherit from a kaafir and a kaafir should not inherit from a 
    Muslim, following this hadeeth. And Allaah is the Source of strength.

When the Resurrection begins, Allaah will cause the bodies to grow by means of rain from the earth which will make these bones grow until each person’s body is restored to the way it was before he died. 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ‘What is between the two Trumpet-blasts will be forty.’ Somebody asked, ‘Forty days?’ But I could not answer. Then he asked, ‘Forty months?’ But I could not answer. Then he asked, ‘Forty years?’ But I could not answer.” Abu Hurayrah added, “Then (after this period) Allah will send water from the sky and then the dead bodies will grow like vegetation grows. There is nothing of the human body that does not decay except one bone; that is the little bone at the end of the coccyx from which the human body will be recreated on the Day of Resurrection.”

Al-Nawawi said: 
“The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ‘What is between the two Trumpet-blasts will be forty.’ Somebody asked, ‘Forty days?’ But I could not answer…” What is meant is that he refused to specify whether it would be forty days, or years, or months. Rather what he was sure of was that it would be just forty. It is explained in another report narrated by someone other than Muslim, which says that it will be forty years. 
The phrase “the little bone at the end of the coccyx” refers to the small bone at the base of the spine, which is the end of the coccyx. This is the first part of a person that is created, and it is what will be left of him so that he will be created anew from it.

Description of the people of Paradise:
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The first group to enter Paradise will look like the moon when it is full; then those who follow them will look like the brightest star in the sky. They will not urinate or defecate, spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of gold, their sweat will be musk, their incense burners will be of aloes-wood. Their wives will be al-hoor al-‘iyn and they will all look alike, like their father Adam, sixty cubits tall.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3149; Muslim, 2834)

Should we wear clothes while bathing?","Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible to shower naked?
Yes, it is permissible for a person to take a bath/shower naked , because this was reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Maymunah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported that she and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took a bath together, washing from a large bowl in which there were traces of dough. 
And it was reported in several places as narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim, and he bathed with ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her).
Should we wear clothes while bathing?
There is no authentic hadith from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to indicate that it is obligatory to cover oneself when bathing. It was reported that some of the Salaf used to cover themselves, but this is not obligatory according to Islam. It is sufficient to be far from where people can see you.
Some scholars use as evidence the hadith in al-Sahihayn which speaks of Musa (peace be upon him) bathing naked (al-Bukhari, 274; Muslim, 339). Al-Nawawi entitled the chapter in Sahih Muslim in which this hadith occurs the permissiblity of bathing naked when one is alone.
It was also reported that Ayyub (peace be upon him) bathed naked. (Sahih al-Bukhari, 275)
Imam al-Nawawi said:
“We have already seen in the previous chapter that it is permissible to uncover the ‘awrah when necessary, when one is alone, such as when taking a bath, urinating , engaging in intimate relations with one's wife , and so on. In all of these cases, it is permissible to uncover one's ‘awrah when one is alone, but in front of other people it is forbidden to uncover the ‘awrah in all cases.”
The scholars said:
“Covering oneself with a wrapper or something similar when taking a bath alone is preferable than uncovering oneself. Uncovering oneself is permissible for the period of time that is essential to take a bath, etc., but uncovering oneself for longer than that is haram according to the most correct opinion.”

The poor (faqeer) means the person who does not have anything.

The poor (miskeen) means a person who has something, but it is
        not enough.

Those employed to collect the funds means those who are appointed by the
        imaam (leader) to collect the zakaat. They are to be given an amount commensurate with
        their efforts, even if they are rich.

Attracting the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islam).
        This refers to those whose hearts the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
        wanted to soften so that they would become Muslim, or so that he could ward off their
        evil, or those whose resolve he wanted to strengthen and help them to be steadfast in
        Islam. These are the three types of those whose hearts were to be softened.

The captives refers to slaves who had drawn up a written contract with
        their masters to purchase their freedom, or the amount needed to purchase their freedom
        without a prior contract.

Those in debt refers to debtors who are unable to pay off their loans.

For Allaah’s Cause refers to the soldiers who are devoted to waging
        jihaad for the sake of Allaah and making the word of Islam prevail.

The wayfarer means a travelling stranger who is cut off from his wealth;
        he may be given whatever he needs even if he is rich in his own land.

The person who is paying zakaah may give his zakaat to all of the kinds
    of people mentioned above, or to some or one of these kinds, whichever it may be.
Some people give a broader meaning to the phrase “for
    Allaah’s Cause”, but the most correct view is that it refers to Jihaad, but it
    may also include Hajj.
Ibn Katheer said:
“The phrase ‘for Allaah’s Cause’ includes the
    fighters who have no right to a regular income from the state. According to Imaam Ahmad,
    al-Hasan and Ishaaq, the Cause of Allaah also includes Hajj, because of the hadeeth.”
    (Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 2/367).
    The hadeeth referred to was narrated by Imaam Ahmad; it
    states that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Hajj and
    ‘Umrah are included in the Cause of Allaah.”
In conclusion:
It is not permissible to use zakaat for this school, unless its
    students are poor or come under any of the eight categories referred to above. But in
    Islam the doors are open for people to help this school in other ways, by giving charity
    (sadaqah), donations and setting up awqaaf (endowments).

I follow the hadith to the best of my ability. Please help me with any knowledge. thank you.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Allah has guaranteed to protect His religion, which includes preserving His miraculous Book, and preserving the Sunnah of His Prophet which helps us to understand the Quran. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quran) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption). [Al-Hijr 15:9]
The word Dhikr here includes both the Quran and the Sunnah.
Many people in the past and at present have tried to insert weak and fabricated ahadith into the pure shareeah and the Prophetic Sunnah. But Allah has thrown their plots back in their faces and has provided means of protecting His religion. Among these means are the trustworthy and reliable scholars who sifted through the reports and checked their sources, examining the biographies of the narrators and even describing the point at which a narrator began to be confused in his narration, and stating who narrated from him before he became confused and who narrated from him afterwards. They described the journeys of the narrator, which cities he visited and from whom in each city he took reports. They checked many details about each narrator, more than can be listed here. All of this indicates that the religion of this Ummah is protected, no matter how hard our enemies try to plot and play about with the religion and distort it.
Sufyaan al-Thawri said: the angels are the guardians of the heavens and the scholars of hadith are the guardians of this world.
Al-Haafiz al-Dhahabi mentioned that Haaroon al-Rasheed was about to execute a zindeeq (heretic), and the zindeeq said: What are you going to do about the one thousand ahadith I have fabricated? Al-Rasheed said: What are you going to do, O enemy of Allah, about Abu Ishaaq al-Fazaari and Abd-Allah ibn al-Mubaarak, who will sift through those ahadith and examine them letter by letter?
The seeker of knowledge can find out about the fabricated (mawdoo) and weak (daeef) ahadith very easily, by looking at the isnaads or chains of narrators, and finding out about the people mentioned there in the books of men i.e., narrators (kutub al-rijaal) and the books which state which narrators are sound or otherwise (kutab al-jarh wal-tadeel).
Many scholars have compiled these fabricated and weak ahadith in books devoted solely to these type of reports, so that it is easy to find out about them then one can beware of them and warn others about them. These books include al-Ilal al-Mutanaahiyah by Ibn al-Jawzi, al-Manaar al-Muneef by Ibn al-Qayyim, al-Laaali al-Masnooah fil-Ahadith al-Mawdooah by al-Suyooti, al-Fawaaid al-Majmooah by al-Shawkaani, al-Asraar al-Marfooah fil-Ahadith al-Mawdooah by Ibn Arraaq, and Daeef al-Jaami al-Sagheer and Silsilat al-Ahadith al-Daeefah wal-Mawdooah, both by Shaykh al-Albani, may Allah have mercy on him.
The fact that the brother has heard about weak and fabricated ahadith indicates that he is making the distinction praise be to Allah between what is saheeh and what is not. This is by the grace of Allah, and is a sign that Allah is protecting this shareeah, as we mentioned above.
We advise our brother to read the books of men i.e., narrators (kutub al-rijaal), the books which state which narrators are sound or otherwise (kutab al-jarh wal-tadeel) and the books of the science of hadith (kutub mustalah al-hadith), so that he can learn the extent of the efforts made by the scholars in the service of the Sunnah.

Do you need to use soap when performing Wudu, specifically washing the face, hands (to the elbows) and feet. All of the sources I have read never say to use soap, but use the word ""wash"".
Also, does changing a baby's diaper invalidate wudu?",,,"Praise be to Allah.We would like to congratulate you and offer praise to Allah for the blessings He has bestowed upon you by guiding you to the Straight Path. We ask Him to help us and you to be steadfast in adhering to this religion.
You do not have to use soap at all when doing wudu. The word wash which you have read in the books you refer to does not mean using soap or any other kind of cleanser.
Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen (may Allah preserve him) said:
Washing the hands and face with soap when doing wudu is not prescribed in shareeah. On the contrary, it is a kind of obstinate and excessive zeal. It was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Those who are obstinate and excessively zealous are doomed. He said it three times.
If there is some kind of dirt on the hands that can only be removed by using soap or some other cleanser, there is nothing wrong with using it in this case, but under ordinary circumstances, using soap when doing wudu is a kind of excessive zeal and bidah (innovation), so it should not be used. (Fataawaa Islamiyyah, 1/223)
With regard to changing a babys diaper, if you mean the act of changing itself, this does not affect the validity of one's wudu.
If you mean that it involves touching something that is naajis (impure, i.e. the babys urine and stools), this does not affect your wudu either, because there is no connection between touching something naajis and the validity of ones wudu. It has been reported that there is scholarly consensus on this point, as stated in the book Al-Awsat by Ibn al-Mundhir (1/203). All one has to do is wash one's hands to get rid of any naajis material.
If you mean that it involves touching the childs private parts, whether the child is a boy or a girl, in the case of a child under the age of two years, the rulings on awrah (that which is to be covered) do not apply, as the scholars have stated, so if you touch them, this does not affect your wudu.

    to move far away from her family, and she does not want to go","my sisters husband does not like my sister
      coming to her parents house and her sister and brothers going to her house, he now wants
      to move far away but my sister is not willing because he does not treat her properly, and
      the situation is coming down to the divorse stage , what advice is there in the quran and
      hadith",,,"Praise be to Allah.Basically the righteous wife should be obedient to her Lord and not
        disobedient to her husband. There is no better deed than a woman obeying her husband as
        Allaah has commanded, at the time when he is disobeying Him with regard to her. 
The husband has the right to stop his wife from visiting her family
        – if he thinks that doing so will serve some shar’i purpose, for example, if she
        is rebellious towards him every time she comes back from visiting them. But if he is doing
        them wrong and they are not disobedient towards Allaah and they do not try to turn his
        wife against him, then the husband is a sinner if he cuts their daughter off from them.
        She also has to obey him with regard to not going out.
The husband has the right to relocate his family wherever he thinks will
        be good for them, and his wife does not have the right to disobey him with regard to that,
        unless it was made a condition in the marriage contract that he would not make her move.
        If this condition was not stipulated, then she has no right to object.
Good treatment of wives is a duty enjoined upon husbands by Allaah, when
        He said (interpretation of the meaning): “… and live with them
        honourably…” [al-Nisa’ 4:19]. The husband does not have the right to
        treat his wife badly. If he sees her doing something that goes against the sharee’ah,
        he should follow the steps laid down by sharee’ah to put the matter right. Firstly,
        he should exhort her in a good manner, and if that does not work, he should adopt the
        method of forsaking her (i.e., not having marital relations with her). If that does not
        work, then he may strike her, in a manner that does not cause pain or injury.
If the husband does treat his wife badly, that does not mean that she
        should disobey him or go against what Allaah has commanded her to do with regard to him.
We advise the sister to do the following:
strive hard to do things that will please her husband such as speaking
          nicely and treating him well.

To deal with him not on the basis that she is his opponent and his equal
          with regard to commanding and forbidding, but on the basis that she is obedient to him and
          is at his beck and call, because this will make a decent man feel shy, and will make
          matters easier for her and help her to convince him. But he is the one who is in charge of
          her (he is qawwaam over her), not the other way round.

She should offer lots of du’aa’ for her husband to be reformed
          and for things to be made easy for her. She should put things right between herself and
          her Lord so that Allaah will put things right between her and other people.

There is nothing wrong with asking someone whose religious commitment
          she trusts and who is wise to intervene between her and her husband, to convince him to
          change his mind about moving, if she thinks that this would have a bad effect on her
          religious commitment or that it would make matters between them worse. Otherwise, she
          should accept what Allaah has decreed for her.

We ask Allaah to make things easy for her and to choose for her whatever
        is better for her spiritual and worldly interests.

4.	Should be loose.
5.	Should not be perfumed.
6.	Should not resemble the clothing of men.
7.	Should not resemble the dress of disbelieving women.
8.	Should not be a garment of fame and vanity.",Conditions of proper hijab,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
Conditions of proper hijab

 It should cover all the body apart from whatever has been exempted.

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed. And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” 
This verse clearly states that it is obligatory to cover all of a woman’s beauty and adornments and not to display any part of that before non-mahram men (strangers) except for whatever appears unintentionally, in which case there will be no sin on them if they hasten to cover it up.
Al-Hafiz ibn Kathir said in his Tafseer:
“This means that they should not display any part of their adornment to non-mahrams , apart from that which it is impossible to conceal. Ibn Mas’ud said: such as the cloak and robe, i.e., what the women of the Arabs used to wear, an outer garment which covered whatever the woman was wearing, except for whatever appeared from beneath the outer garment. There is no sin on a woman with regard to this because it is impossible to conceal it.”

It should not be an adornment in and of itself.

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And not to show off their adornment.” [al-Nur 24:31] The general meaning of this phrase includes the outer garment, because if it is decorated it will attract men’s attention to her. This is supported by the verse in Surat al-Ahzab (interpretation of the meaning):
“And stay in your houses, and do not display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance.” [al-Ahzab 33:33]. 
It is also supported by the hadith in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: There are three, do not ask me about them: a man who leaves the jama’ah (larger Muslim community), disobeys his leader and dies disobedient; a female or male slave who runs away then dies; and a woman whose husband is absent and left her with everything she needs, and after he left she made a wanton display of herself. Do not ask about them.” (Narrated by al-Hakim, 1/119; Ahmad, 6/19; from the hadith of Faddalah bint ‘Ubayd. Its isnad is sahih and it is in al-Adab al-Mufrad).

It should be thick and not transparent or see-through because it cannot cover properly otherwise. Transparent or see-through clothing makes a woman more tempting and beautiful. Concerning this the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “During the last days of my ummah, there will be women who are clothed but naked, with something on their heads like the humps of camels. Curse them, for they are cursed. Another hadith adds: They will not enter Paradise or even smell its fragrance, although its fragrance can be detected from such and such a distance.” (Narrated by Muslim from the report of Abu Hurayrah)

Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: “What the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) meant was women who wear clothes made of light fabric which describes and does not cover. They are clothed in name but naked in reality.” (Transmitted by al-Suyuti in Tanwir al-Hawalik, 3/103)

 It should be loose, not tight so that it describes any part of the body.

The purpose of clothing is to prevent fitnah (temptation), and this can only be achieved if clothes are wide and loose. Tight clothes, even if they conceal the colour of the skin, still describe the size and shape of the body or part of it, and create a vivid image in the minds of men. 
The corruption or invitation to corruption that is inherent in that is quite obvious. So the clothes must be wide. Usamah ibn Zayd said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave me a thick Egyptian garment that was one of the gifts given to him by Dihyah al-Kalbi, and I gave it to my wife to wear. He said, Why do I not see you wearing that Egyptian garment? I said, I gave it to my wife to wear. He said, Tell her to wear a gown underneath it, for I am afraid that it may describe the size of her bones.” (Narrated by al-Diya al-Maqdisi in al-Ahadith al-Mukhtarah, 1/442, and by Ahmad and al-Bayhaqi, with a hasan isnad)

It should not be perfumed with bakhur or fragrance .

There are many hadiths which forbid women to wear perfume when they go out of their houses. We will quote here some of those which have good chains of narration:

Abu Musa al-Ash’ari said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Any woman who puts on perfume then passes by people so that they can smell her fragrance, is an adulteress.
Zaynab al-Thaqafiyyah reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: If any one of you (women) goes out to the mosque, let her not touch any perfume.
Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Any woman who has scented herself with bakhur (incense), let her not attend ‘Isha prayers with us.
Musa ibn Yasar said that a woman passed by Abu Hurayrah and her scent was overpowering. He said, O female slave of al-Jabbar, are you going to the mosque? She said, Yes, He said, And have you put on perfume because of that? She said, Yes. He said, Go back and wash yourself, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: If a woman comes out to the mosque and her fragrance is overpowering, Allah will not accept any prayer from her until she goes home and washes herself.

These hadiths are general in implication. Just as the prohibition covers perfume applied to the body, it also covers perfume applied to the clothes, especially in the third hadith, where bakhur (incense) is mentioned, because incense is used specifically to perfume the clothes.
The reason for this prohibition is quite clear, which is that women’s fragrance may cause undue provocation of desires. The scholars also included other things under this heading of things to be avoided by women who want to go to the mosque, such as beautiful clothes, jewellery that can be seen, excessive adornments and mingling with men. (Fath al-Bari, 2/279)
Ibn Daqiq al-’Id said:
“This indicates that it is forbidden for a woman who wants to go to the mosque to wear perfume, because this causes provocation of men’s desires. This was reported by al-Manawi in Fayd al-Qadir, in the commentary on the first hadith of Abu Hurayrah quoted above.”

 It should not resemble the clothing of men .

It was reported in the authentic hadiths that a woman who imitates men in dress or in other ways is cursed. There follow some of the hadiths that we know:

Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the man who wears women’s clothes, and the woman who wears men’s clothes.
‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: They are not part of us, the women who imitate men and the men who imitate women.
Ibn ‘Abbas said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed effeminate men and masculine women. He said, Throw them out of your houses. He said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) expelled So and So, and ‘Umar expelled So and So. According to another version: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed men who imitate women and women who imitate men.
‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: There are three who will not enter Paradise and Allah will not even look at them on the Day of Resurrection: one who disobeys his parents, a woman who imitates men, and the dayyuth (cuckold, weak man who feels no jealousy over his womenfolk).
Ibn Abi Malikah whose name was ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Ubayd-Allah said: It was said to ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), What if a woman wears (men’s) sandals? She said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed women who act like men.

These hadiths clearly indicate that it is forbidden for women to imitate men and vice versa. This usually includes dress and other matters, apart from the first hadith quoted above, which refers to dress only.
Abu Dawud said, in Masail al-Imam Ahmad (p. 261): I heard Ahmad being asked about a man who dresses his slave woman in a tunic. He said, “Do not clothe her in men’s garments, do not make her look like a man.” Abu Dawud said: I said to Ahmad, ‘Can he give her bachelor sandals to wear?’ He said, ‘No, unless she wears them to do wudu. I said, ‘What about for beauty?’ He said, ‘No.’ I said, ‘Can he cut her hair short?’ He said, ‘No.’

 It should not resemble the dress of disbelieving women .

It is stated in Shari`ah that Muslims, men and women alike, should not resemble or imitate the disbelievers with regard to worship, festivals or clothing that is specific to them. This is an important Islamic principle which nowadays, unfortunately, is neglected by many Muslims, even those who care about religion and calling others to Islam. This is due either to ignorance of their religion, or because they are following their own whims and desires, or because of deviation, combined with modern customs and imitation of non-Muslims in Europe. This was one of the causes of the Muslims decline and weakness, which enabled the foreigners to overwhelm and colonize them. “Verily, Allah will not change the condition of a people as long as they do not change their state themselves.” [al-Ra’ad 13:11 interpretation of the meaning]. If only they knew.
It should be known that there is a great deal of sound evidence for these important rules in the Quran and Sunnah, and that the evidence in the Quran is elaborated upon in the Sunnah, as is always the case.

 It should not be a garment of fame and vanity.

Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever wears a garment of fame and vanity in this world, Allah will clothe him in a garment of humiliation on the Day of Resurrection, then He will cause Fire to flame up around him.” (Hijab al-Marah al-Muslimah, p. 54-67)

My brother is getting married and this involves a religious service in a church followed by a meal. I have told my family that I cannot partake in the  religious service. I wish to know if Islam allows me to attend the meal with my wife and child, where some alcohol may be served to some christians with the meal. If it is not allowed then what advice can you give me. Please give the answer with evidence.
The issue is of great importance since I have been estranged from my father (by his choice) for 7 years and I am trying to invite them to Islam.
Jazakallah khayran",,,"Praise be to Allah.1. We praise Allaah for having guided you to Islam and we ask Him to complete His favour by helping you to be steadfast and by guiding your family to Islam.


You are doing the right thing by not attending the religious service in the church, because taking part in religious proceedings of non-Muslims is, at the very least, a major sin, and could lead to kufr.


With regard to attending your brother’s wedding party where alcohol will be served with the food, we advise you not to take part as you say. Attending such parties is haraam and is a major sin. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… then after the remembrance sit not in the company of those people who are the zaalimoon (polytheists and wrong-doers, etc.)” [al-An’aam 6:68].


The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand [by taking action]; if he cannot, then with his tongue [by speaking out]; and if he cannot, then with his heart [by feeling that it is wrong] – and that is the weakest of faith.” (Narrated by Muslim, 49).
When you take part in such events, you will not be able to change the evil actions with your hand or your tongue – in most cases – so all you can do is change it with your heart, and you cannot be really doing so if you are taking part.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever believes in Allaah and the Last Day, let him not sit at a table where wine is being drunk.”
(Narrated by Ahmad, 14241, and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwaa’ al-Ghaleel, 7/6).
The reason why it is forbidden – as it appears – is that sitting with them implies that you condone the evil action.
4. Apart from the fact that these things are forbidden, if the brother makes these compromises, this will weaken his efforts to call his family to Islam. The more sincere the daa’iyah is towards himself and to His Lord, the stronger his efforts to call others will be. But if he compromises and vacillates, this will make him look less trustworthy in the eyes of others.
