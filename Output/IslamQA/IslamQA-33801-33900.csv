“Yes, his sacrifice will be accepted but he will be a sinner. With regard to a widespread belief among the common people that if a man removes anything from his hair, nails or skin during the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah , his sacrifice is not valid, this is not correct, because there is no connection between the validity of his sacrifice and his removing anything from these three things .” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 7/533)

Please advise on how she should approach it. She does not want to say to her parents that somebody is ready to marry her and support her (even if she finds somebody) because that will make her parents think she converted because of the guy (which is not the case). please advise.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We praise Allaah for guiding this sister to 
    embrace Islam, and we ask Him to make her heart steadfast and to increase her in faith and certainty. 
We advise her to tell her parents or not to 
    tell them, depending on the consequences of either action. Will that lead to them disowning her without throwing her out of the house or harming 
    her? Or do they have the power to force her to go back to their religion or not? 
Whatever the case, if telling them will lead 
    to bad consequences for her, then we advise her to delay that until her faith is stronger and her knowledge increases. We also advise the Muslims 
    who are aware that is Muslim to find a righteous husband for her and to prepare a suitable place for her in the event that she has to leave her 
    parents. 
The fact that her parents may think that she 
    has become Muslim in order to marry a particular person does not matter, and there is nothing wrong with her getting married if that will give her 
    protection and help her to adhere to her religion.

    experience in your country who know about this sister’s situation and that of her family, and their circumstances.

33842,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/33842,Ruling on regarding numbers as lucky or unlucky,I heard number 7 is lucky; number 14 or 13 is unlucky. Are they true?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.What you mention is not true; there is no connection between numbers and luck. Regarding the numbers 13 and 14, or any other numbers or days, months or colours, as unlucky comes under the heading of tatayyur (superstitious belief in bird or other omens) which is forbidden in Islam. 
Al-Bukhari (5776) and Muslim (2224) narrated from Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no ‘adwa (transmission of infectious disease without the permission of Allah) and no tiyarah (superstitious belief in bird omens), but I like optimism.” They said, “What is optimism?” He said, “A good word.” 
Ahmad (4194), Abu Dawood (3910), al-Tirmidhi (1614) and Ibn Maajah (3538) narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Tiyarah (belief in evil omens) is shirk.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
Ahmad (7045) and al-Tabaraani narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever lets tiyarah stop him from doing something is guilty of shirk.” They said, “What is the kafaarah for that?” He said, “To say: Allahumma la khayra illaa khayruka wa laa tayra illaa tayruka wa laa ilaaha ghayruka (O Allah, there is no good except Your good, no birds except Yours, and there is no god beside You).”
Classed as hasan by al-Arna’oot and as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 6264. 
Al-Tabaraani narrated in al-Kabeer from ‘Imraan ibn Husayn that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “He is not one of us who practices augury [seeking omens in birds] or has that done for him, or who practices divination or has that done for him, or who practices witchcraft or has that done for him.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 5435. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim, no. 2224:  
Tatayyur (belief in bad omens) is pessimism, and is based on something disliked, be it a word or action or something seen… They used to startle gazelles and birds to make them move; if they went to the right they would regard that as a good omen and go ahead with their journeys or other plans, but if they went to the left they would cancel their journeys and plans, and regard that as a bad omen. So it would often prevent them from doing things that were in their interests. Islam cancelled out all that and forbade it, and said that it had no effect, whether good or bad. This is what is meant by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “There is no tiyarah (superstitious belief in bird omens),” and in another hadeeth, “Tiyarah is shirk” – i.e., the belief that it can bring benefit or harm, if they act upon it believing that it has any effect then this is shirk, because they think that it has an effect on what one does or that it can make things happen. 
With regard to fa’l or belief in good omens, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) described it as a good and righteous word. 
The scholars said: fa’l may be with regard to good or bad things, but it usually has to do with good things, but tiyarah can only have to do with bad things. They said: It may be used as a metaphor for good things… And the scholars said: He liked fa’l because if a person hopes for the benefit and bounty of Allah, whether for a strong or weak reason, he will be in a good state, and if he is mistaken in his hope, then hope is still good for him. But if he loses hope in Allah then that is bad for him. Tiyarah means thinking badly and expecting calamity. One example of fa’l is when a person is sick and he hears optimistic words such as “Yaa saalim (O healthy one)!”, or when a person is looking for something and he hears someone say “Yaa waajid (O finder).” So this fills his heart with the hope that he will recover or find what he is looking for. And Allah knows best. 
End quote from al-Nawawi, may Allah have mercy on him. 
Shaykh al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If the Muslim pays any heed to these things, one of two scenarios must apply, the first of which is that he responds to it, so he either goes ahead or cancels his plan, in which case he is basing his actions on something that is invalid; and the second of which is that he does not respond, so he goes ahead and does not care about it, but in his heart there is still some worry or anxiety. Even though this is less serious than the first scenario, he should not pay any attention to these things at all, and he should depend on Allah. 
Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 2/113 
The point is that it is not permissible to regard any numbers as unlucky. Whoever reads or hears a number and regards that as a bad omen has committed tatayyur which is forbidden. The expiation (kafaarah) for that, as stated in the hadeeth quoted above, is to say: “Allahumma la khayra illaa khayruka wa laa tayra illaa tayruka wa laa ilaaha ghayruka (O Allah, there is no good except Your good, no birds except Yours, and there is no god beside You).”

I heard, if you don;t sit for a second to pass a moment, which could bring you bad luck/accident, you would face the bad luck/accident. Are these true? Can you use the Quran and the hadiths about these?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.What you have heard is not correct, rather that is a kind of tatayyur (superstitious belief in bird or other omens) or regarding seeing and hearing certain things as being bad luck. This is the way of the ignorant and the mushrikeen, who used to let such things keep them from doing what they wanted. Allah criticized them for that and said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, their evil omens are with Allah but most of them know not”
[al-A’raaf 7:131] 
“They (Messengers) said: Your evil omens be with you! (Do you call it evil omen) because you are admonished? Nay, but you are a people Musrifoon (transgressing all bounds by committing all kinds of great sins, and by disobeying Allah)” [Yaa-Seen 36:19]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade superstitious belief in omens and said that it is a kind of shirk (associating others with Allah) that detracts from Tawheed, because superstition is something that the Shaytaan uses to create fear. It is mentioned in several ahaadeeth that it is forbidden, such as the following: 
The hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no ‘adwaa [transmission of infectious disease without the permission of Allah], no tiyarah [superstitious belief in bird omens].” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5757; Muslim, 102. 
It was narrated by Abu Dawood (3910), and al-Tirmidhi (1614) who classed it as saheeh, from Ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) in a marfoo’ report: “Tiyarah is shirk, tiyarah is shirk,” but there is no one among us (who does not feel such things) but Allah takes it away by means of tawakkul (putting one's trust in Him). 
The words “but there is no one among us (who does not feel such things) but Allah takes it away by means of tawakkul (putting one's trust in Him)” are the words of Ibn Mas’ood, not of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
What this means that there is no one among us who does not some superstitious feelings in his heart, but Allah takes them away from his heart by means of trust in Him and delegating one’s affairs to Him. 
It was also narrated that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no ‘adwaa [transmission of infectious disease without the permission of Allah] and no tiyarah [superstitious belief in bird omens], but I like fa’l.” They said, “What is fa’l?” He said, “A good word.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5756; Muslim, 2220. 
These ahaadeeth clearly indicate that tiyarah (superstition) is haraam and is a kind of shirk, because it means that the heart is attached to something other than Allah. The people of the Jaahiliyyah believed that it could bring them some benefit or ward off some harm if they did whatever was dictated by their superstitions, and it was as if they were associating others with Allah. So the Lawgiver cancelled that and demonstrated it to be false when He told them that it has no effect on bringing benefits or warding off harm. 
Once this is established, if any such thing happens to you, then you have to fear Allah and put your trust in Him, and seek His help and never pay any attention to it. You should handle the matter by doing what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined, as narrated by Abu Dawood (3919) with a saheeh isnaad from ‘Urwah ibn ‘Aamir (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: Mention of tiyarah was made in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he said: “The best of it is fa’l (optimism, belief in good omens) and it should not prevent a Muslim from going ahead (with his plans). If any one of you sees something that he dislikes, let him say. ‘Allahumma laa ya’ti bi’l-hasanaat illa anta wa laa yadfa’ al-sayi’aat illa anta, wa laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa bika (O Allah, no one brings good things but You and no one wards off bad things but You, and there is no power and no strength except with You).’” 
Imam Ahmad narrated in his Musnad (2/220), and al-Albaani classed as saheeh in al-Saheehah (1065) the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas (may Allah be pleased with him): “Whoever lets tiyarah (superstition) stop him from doing something is guilty of shirk.” They said, “What is the kafaarah (expiation) for that?” He said, “To say: Allahumma la khayra illaa khayruka wa laa tayra illaa tayruka wa laa ilaaha ghayruka (O Allah, there is no good except Your good, no birds except Yours, and there is no god beside You).” 
It should also be noted that tiyarah will not harm the one who ignores it and goes ahead and does what he wants to do. But as for the one who does not sincerely put his trust in Allah and who gives in to the Shaytaan and his waswaas (whispers), he will be punished by falling into the thing that he dislikes, because he has turned away from faith in Allah.

    Interacting with Jews, Christians and all other kuffaar is 
    subject to guidelines and regulations that are set out in Islamic sharee’ah. 
    These guidelines include the following: 

    Firstly: 

    It is permissible to speak with the kaafirs and to discuss 
    permissible matters with him. 

    Secondly: 

    It is not permissible to take the kuffaar as close friends 
    (awliya’). Taking them as close friends may happen in many ways, such as 
    mixing with them, feeling comfortable with them, living with them, taking 
    them as close friends, loving them, preferring them over the believers, and 
    so on. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “You (O Muhammad) will not find any people who believe in 
    Allaah and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allaah and 
    His Messenger (Muhammad), even though they were their fathers or their sons 
    or their brothers or their kindred (people)”

    [al-Mujaadilah 58:22]

    Thirdly: 

    It is permissible to interact with the kuffaar to buy, sell, 
    lend and so on. It was narrated in saheeh reports that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) borrowed a weapon from Safwaan 
    ibn Umayyah, and that he bought food from the Jews. 

    With regard to how to treat a wife from among the people of 
    the Book (i.e., a Jewish or Christian woman), Allaah says in His Book 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Allaah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with 
    those who fought not against you on account of religion nor drove you out of 
    your homes. Verily, Allaah loves those who deal with equity”

    [al-Mumtahanah 60:8]

    So it is permissible to treat a Jewish or Christian wife 
    justly and kindly, and there is nothing wrong with that; it does not come 
    under the heading of the type of close friendship and strong bonds that is 
    forbidden. 

    Al-Kaasaani said in Badaa’i al-Sanaa’i’ (2/270): 
It is not permissible for 
    a Muslim to marry a mushrik woman, because Allaah says (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 

    “And do not marry Al-Mushrikaat (idolatresses) till they 
    believe (worship Allaah Alone)”

    [al-Baqarah 2:221]

    But it is permissible to marry a woman from among the people 
    of the Book, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “(Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the 
    believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and 
    Christians) before your time”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:5]

    The difference is that the basic principle is that a Muslim 
    is not permitted to marry a kaafir, because marrying a kaafir woman and 
    mixing with her at the same time when there is religious animosity will not 
    produce the tranquility and love which are the basic purpose of marriage, 
    but it is permitted to marry a woman from among the People of the Book in 
    the hope that she will become Muslim, because she believes in the Books of 
    the Prophets and Messengers in general, but she does not believe in a 
    comprehensive and correct manner, because what she was taught is different 
    from what is real. It is likely that when the facts are pointed out to her, 
    she will accept them.  So her husband should call her to Islam and tell her 
    how things really are. So when a Muslim marries such a woman there is the 
    hope that she will become Muslim, so it is permissible to marry them for 
    this purpose. This is unlike the case of a mushrik woman, because by 
    choosing to associate others in worship with Allaah and not to believe in 
    the Prophets and Messengers, this indicates that she does not pay any 
    attention to proof and evidence and will not respond to da’wah, and will 
    rather continue to follow the way of her forefathers and to follow her whims 
    and desires. So there will remain that religious animosity which will not 
    produce the tranquility and love which are the basic purpose of marriage, so 
    it is not permissible to marry such a woman. 

    And he said in Haashiyat al-‘Adawi (1/273): 
The phrase “we forsake 
    those who disbelieve in You” means we cast aside any positive feelings 
    towards those who worship anyone other than You, and we will not love his 
    way or feel any inclination towards it. But this does mean that we are not 
    allowed to marry a woman from among the people of the Book, because marrying 
    her may attract her to the religion of Islam, as marriage is a type of 
    interacting with others and what is meant here is to hate the way of kufr.

33866,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/33866,Does weeping and shedding tears for the deceased cause him any harm?,Does weeping and shedding tears for the deceased cause him any harm?,,,"Praise be to Allah.It was narrated in more than one hadeeth from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that the deceased suffers because of the weeping of his family over him. For example, Muslim narrated in his Saheeh (927) from Ibn ‘Umar that Hafsah wept for ‘Umar, and he said, “Calm down, O my daughter! Do you not know that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The deceased suffers because of his family’s weeping over him’?” 
And it was also proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wept for the deceased on more than one occasion, such as when he wept at the death of his son Ibraaheem, as was narrated by al-Bukhaari (2/105) and Muslim (7/76) from the hadeeth of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him). He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also wept at the death of one of his daughters, whilst she was being buried, as was narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1258 from the hadeeth of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him). 
And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wept when one of his grandchildren died, as narrated by al-Bukhaari (1284) and Muslim (923), from the hadeeth of Usaamah ibn Zayd (may Allah be pleased with them both). 
If it is asked, how can we reconcile between the hadeeths which forbid weeping for the deceased and those which permit it? 
The answer is: 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained that in a hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari (7377) and Muslim (923) from Usaamah ibn Zayd, according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wept for the son of one of his daughters. Sa’d ibn ‘Ubaadah said: “What is this, O Messenger of Allah?” He said, “This is compassion which Allah puts in the hearts of His slaves. Allah shows mercy to those of His slaves who are merciful.” 
Al-Nawawi said: 
What this means is that Sa’d thought that all kinds of weeping were haraam, and that shedding tears was haraam. He thought that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had forgotten that, so he reminded him. But the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained that simply weeping and shedding tears is neither haraam nor makrooh, rather it is compassion and is something good. What is haraam is wailing and lamenting, and weeping that is accompanied by one or both of these actions, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah does not punish for tears that are shed or for sorrow in the heart, rather He punishes or shows mercy because of this” – and he pointed to his tongue. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was asked – as it says in al-Fataawa, 24/380 – whether the weeping of a mother or brothers and sisters has any effect on the deceased. He said: “Rather there is no sin in tears shed by the eyes and sorrow in the heart, but lamenting and wailing are forbidden.” 
With regard to weeping for the deceased even after some time has passed, there is nothing wrong with that, so long as it is not accompanied by wailing, lamenting or feeling displeased with the will and decree of Allah. 
Muslim (976) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) visited the grave of his mother and wept, and those who were around him also wept. He said: “I asked my Lord for permission to pray for forgiveness for her, and He did not give me permission; and I asked Him for permission to visit her grave and He gave me permission. So visit the graves, for they will remind you of death.”
