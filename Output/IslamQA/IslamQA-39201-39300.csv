39201,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39201,Perfuming the deceased and applying bukhoor to the shroud for men and women,"If a woman dies, should perfume be applied to her as in the case of a man? Should the shroud of a man and a woman be perfumed, or does perfuming the deceased apply only to men?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
It is mustahabb to perfume the shroud, whether the deceased is a man or a woman. This is indicated by the saheeh Sunnah. It is proven in al-Saheehayn that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded the women who were washing his daughter to put some camphor or a little camphor in the last wash. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1253; Muslim, 939. Camphor is a type of perfume. 
Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath: 
It is said that the reason why camphor is used, although it is a perfume, is because of the angels and others who attend, in addition to the fact that it has a drying and cooling effect; it can penetrate the body of the deceased and stiffen the body, keep vermin away, prevent wastes from being expelled, and prevent the body from decomposing rapidly. It is the most effective of perfumes in that sense. This is the reason why it is put in the last wash, because if it was put in the first wash the water would remove it. But can musk, for example, be used instead of camphor? If we think just in terms of fragrance, then yes, otherwise the answer is no. It was said that if no camphor is available, other kinds of perfume may be used, even if it has only one of these qualities. End quote. 
Al-Nawawi said in Sharh Muslim: 
This indicates that it is mustahabb to use a little camphor in the final wash. There is consensus among us on this point, and this is the view of Maalik, Ahmad and a number of scholars, because of this hadeeth, and because it perfumes the deceased and makes his body stiff and cool, and prevents the body decomposing rapidly. End quote. 
It was narrated that Jaabir said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When you perfume the deceased with incense (bakhoor) then perfume him three times.” Narrated by Imam Ahmad, 14131. al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (5/155): Its isnaad is saheeh. It was also classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 278. 
The word deceased here refers to both male and female. 
What is meant is perfuming the shroud with incense. Al-Bayhaqi mentioned in his Sunan (3/568) that this hadeeth was also narrated with the words, “Perfume the shroud of the deceased with incense three times.” 
See Badaa’i’ al-Sanaa’i’, 1/307. 
It was narrated that Asma’ bint Abi Bakr (may Allah be pleased with her) said to her family: “Perfume my garments with incense when I die, then apply hanoot to me.” Narrated by Maalik in al-Muwatta’, 528; and by al-Bayhaqi in al-Sunan al-Kubra, 3/568. 
It says in al-Muntaqa: Hanoot is that which is put on the body and shroud of the deceased of perfume, musk, amber, camphor and anything else that is used for its scent rather than its colour, because the purpose here is the scent rather than beautification with the colour. End quote. 
This ruling – that it is mustahabb to perfume the deceased – does not include one who is in ihraam for Hajj or ‘Umrah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said concerning a man in ihraam who died at ‘Arafah: “And do not put any perfume on him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1851; Muslim, 1206. According to another report: “Do not bring any perfume near him.” 
Al-Nawawi said: It is mustahabb to perfume the shroud with incense except in the case of a man or woman who is in ihraam. 
Al-Majmoo’, 5/156 
Secondly: 
With regard to the manner in which the deceased is to be perfumed, the perfume is to be placed on the parts of the body on which one prostrates, because of their noble status, and on the places where dirt gathers such as the backs of the knees. If the whole body is perfumed, there is nothing wrong with that. 
Al-Bayhaqi narrated (3/568) that Ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Camphor is to be put on the parts of the body on which one prostrates, which are: the forehead, the nose, the hands, the knees and the feet, because he used to prostrate on these parts so they are deserving of greater honour.  
See Sharh Fath al-Qadeer, 2/110 
Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (3/388): The hanoot (perfume which is used for the deceased) should be placed on the joints such as the backs of the knees and beneath the armpits, because these are places where dirt gathers. And it should be put on the parts on which he used to prostrate because they are nobler. And if the entire body is perfumed there is nothing wrong with that. End quote. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is there any report that the entire body of the deceased may be perfumed? 
He replied: Yes, that was narrated from some of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them). 
Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 17/97 
Thirdly: 
If a woman who was in mourning following the death of her husband dies, should she be perfumed? 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (5/164-165): 
The correct view is that it is not haraam to put perfume on her, because perfume is forbidden to her during her ‘iddah so that no one will want to marry her, but this consideration no longer applies after she died. End quote.",Islam Q&A

But he must take care to avoid letting any of these moisturizers reach his stomach, but if any of that reaches his stomach without him intending it to, there is no sin on him, just as if he were to rinse his mouth and some water were to reach his stomach without him intending it to, that does not break his fast.” (Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 19/224)","Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 19/224"

With regard to paying zakaah, is it permissible to donate this money for building a hospital or orphanage (by putting this money in a special account) or must it be given hand to hand?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Putting money in riba-based banks and taking riba for that, which is called 
    interest, is a major sin, and paying zakaah on that money does not absolve one of sin. 
See the answer to question no.
    22339, which explains the prohibition on riba. 
The answer to question no. 181 
    explains the prohibition on putting money in riba-based banks. 
Secondly:  
With regard to what zakaah may be spent on, it is not permissible to use it  for 
    building a hospital or an orphanage, whether it is given hand to hand or via another means. The areas in which zakaah may be spent are limited and 
    it is not permissible to add anything to them. The areas in which zakaah may be spent are mentioned in the verse in which Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“As-Sadaqaat (here it means Zakaah) are only for the Fuqaraa’ (poor), and 
    Al-Masaakeen(the poor) and those employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined 
    (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in debt; and for Allaah’s Cause (i.e. for Mujaahidoon — those fighting in a holy battle), 
    and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything)”
[al-Tawbah 9:60]
We have explained these further in our answer to question no. 6977 
We have stated in a number of our answers that it is not permissible to use zakaah 
    money for building mosques or schools, or for printing copies of the Qur’aan. See questions no.
    13734 and 21797. 
But if the intention in giving the money to an orphanage is so that this money 
    will be spent on the poor orphans, then this is permissible, if the orphans are poor. 
It is better for you to dispose of the zakaah on your wealth yourself, so that you 
    can be certain that you have given it to one of the causes enjoined by Allaah. You have to do your best to identify those who are entitled to it.

39214,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39214,Possession and the illusions and facts that are connected to it,"I have been suffering from jinn possession for nearly two years, and am not cured. What is strange is that I can feel them in my body and can control them to some degree, such as when I hear Qur’aan, I feel pain from them starting in my stomach but I am able, by Allaah’s leave, to make them stop moving. 
I believe that they will never leave unless Allaah wills it. So I pray to Allaah and I do not go and look for someone to perform ruqyah by reciting Qur’aan. 
, I am righteous by the grace of Allaah, but sometimes I commit some sins. What is the reason for that? What advice can you give?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There are some facts and some illusions connected to the issue of jinn possession, and among most people nowadays the illusions outweigh the facts. The Sunnis are unanimously agreed that the jinn can dwell in the bodies of humans, but that does not mean that everyone who has epilepsy is possessed by the jinn, because epilepsy may have physical causes. The pains etc. that many people feel in their bodies cannot be ascribed for certain to the actions of the jinn, rather they may be illusions or something imaginary. 
So you should not pay any attention to the whispers of the Shaytaan that make you think that he has done this and that you can control it. This is one of the ways in which the Shaytaan deceives the Muslim and makes him think that he can control him, and that he has powers that in fact he does not possess. This may lead to bad consequences as has happened to many people. 
You have to keep on treating yourself with ruqyah, for the Book of your Lord is available to you. Recite from it and treat yourself with ruqyah. Whether you are possessed or not, you will undoubtedly benefit from this reading and ruqyah. 
For more information please see question no. 3476. 
If you go to someone who is known for using ruqyah as prescribed in sharee’ah and is also righteous and keeps away from deviance and myths, there is nothing wrong with that and it may be a means of your being healed from this problem. 
You have to seek the help of Allaah and pray to Him and beseech Him to prevent the plots of the devils among mankind and the jinn from harming you. Man is always in need of his Lord, and Allaah is Able to rid you of these thoughts, illusions and facts that are harming you.

“There is nothing wrong with a fasting person diving into water or swimming in it, because that is not among the things that break the fast. 
The basic principle is that things are permissible unless there is evidence to show that they are makruh or haram. There is no evidence that swimming is makruh or haram, rather some of the scholars regarded it as makruh lest anything enter the swimmer’s throat without him realizing it.” (Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 19/285) 
He also said: 
“There is nothing wrong with a fasting person swimming, and he may swim as he wishes, and dive into the water , but he must take care to avoid letting water get into his stomach as much as he can.” (Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 19/284 )

39234,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39234,It is not permissible to give money instead of food for the fidyah for not fasting,"An old, sick man cannot fast. Is it acceptable for him to give money instead of food?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We must understand an important principle, which is that when Allah specifically mentions giving food, then it must be food. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskeen (poor person) (for every day). But whoever does good of his own accord, it is better for him. And that you fast is better for you if only you know” [al-Baqarah 2:184]
And He said concerning kafaarat yameen (the expiation for breaking a vow) (interpretation of the meaning): 
“for its expiation (a deliberate oath) feed ten Masaakeen (poor persons), on a scale of the average of that with which you feed your own families, or clothe them or manumit a slave. But whosoever cannot afford (that), then he should fast for three days. That is the expiation for the oaths when you have sworn. And protect your oaths (i.e. do not swear much). Thus Allah makes clear to you His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) that you may be grateful” [al-Maa’idah 5:89]
In the case of zakaat al-fitr, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined giving one saa’ of food as zakaat al-fitr. So whatever is mentioned specifically as food or as feeding (the poor) in the texts cannot be given in the form of money. 
Based on this, if an old man is required to give food instead of fasting, it is not acceptable for him to give money instead. Even if he paid ten times the value of the food, it would not be acceptable, because he has turned away from what is mentioned in the texts. Similarly with regard to zakaat al-fitr, if he paid ten times the value of the food, it would not be acceptable in place of a saa’ of wheat, because the equivalent value is not mentioned in the texts. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does an action that is not part of this matter of ours will have it rejected.” 
Based on this, we say to the brother who is not able to fast because of old age: Feed one poor person for each day, and you may give the food in one of two ways: 
1 – Giving it to them in their houses, giving each one one-fourth of a saa’ of rice along with some condiment to accompany it. 
2 – Making food and inviting a number of poor people whom you are obliged to feed. So if ten days have passed, you could make dinner and invite ten poor people to come and eat, and do that when the next ten days have passed and the next ten. When Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) grew old and became unable to fast, he would feed thirty poor persons on the last day of Ramadan.

39235,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39235,If he catches up with the imam when he is prostrating or sitting,"If I enter the mosque and the imam is prostrating or sitting between the two prostrations or in the tashahhud, should I join him? Should I say another takbeer for prostration or sitting after the opening takbeer?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
If a worshipper enters the mosque when the imam is prostrating or sitting or whatever, he should join him, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If you come to prayer and we are prostrating, then prostrate but do not count that as anything (i.e., as a rak’ah), and whoever catches the rak'ah has caught up with the prayer.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 893; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
See also question no. [46811]. 
But this rak’ah does not count for him, because he did not catch up with bowing with the imam. 
Secondly: 
The scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) have stated that the worshipper who catches up with his imam when he is prostrating should say the opening takbeer and then prostrate with his imam, without saying takbeer, because he has not caught up at a point where takbeer is required. 
Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (2/183): If he catches up with the imam in a pillar (obligatory part of the prayer) other than bowing, he should not say any takbeer apart from the opening takbeer, and he should go down (in prostration) without saying takbeer, because this (rak’ah) is not counted, and he has missed the point where takbeer is required. If he catches up with him when he is prostrating or in the first tashahhud, he should say takbeer when he stands up with the imam for the third rak’ah, because he is following him, so he should follow him in saying takbeer, like one who catches up with him at the beginning. 
See al-Majmoo’ Sharh al-Muhadhdhab, 4/218 
This is unlike the takbeer for bowing, which is counted for him, and it is unlike what he should do after that when he moves with the imam, getting up from prostration etc. He should say takbeer, following the imam in his movements, even if it is not counted for him, as stated by Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
The second opinion is that he should go down in prostration with the imam, saying takbeer. So he should say takbeer the first time to enter the prayer (opening takbeer), and the second time to prostrate or sit, because he has to follow the imam, who is sitting or prostrating, and when one moves from standing to prostrating, there should be a takbeer. 
See al-Majmoo’, 4/218; Haashiyat Ibn Qaasim, 2/277; al-Insaaf, 2/225; al-Sunan al-Kubra, by al-Bayhaqi, 2/91 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/128: 
The well known view of the fuqaha’ (may Allaah have mercy on them) is that he should go down (in prostration) without saying takbeer. 
But despite that we say that if a person says takbeer it does not matter, and if he does not say it, it does not matter, and we say that it is the person’s choice, because there is no clear evidence to differentiate between bowing and anything else. So it is possible to say that sitting does not come after standing, but what made me sit is the fact that I am following the imam, so now I am moving to an essential part of the prayer that I am enjoined to move to. But I am doing that to follow the imam, not because this is how the prayer should be in principle. Undoubtedly he supports the view that he should say takbeer, so what we think concerning this matter is that in order to be on the safe side he should say takbeer. End quote. 
Thirdly: 
If he enters the prayer and goes down in prostration, then the imam raises his head before he puts his forehead on the ground, then it seems that he should come back up with him and not prostrate, because the time for following him (in prostration) ceased when the imam raised his head from the ground before the person put his forehead on the ground, unlike if he had been with him from the beginning of the prayer. 
If he catches up with him in the first prostration and he goes down in prostration then the imam raises his head, and sits between the two prostrations, the person should sit with him, then when he does the second prostration he should prostrate with him. 
And Allaah knows best.

39258,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39258,Ruling on greeting women with salaam and returning their greeting,"Is it permissible for me to return the salaams of a woman who is a stranger to me, i.e., a non-mahram?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Allaah has commanded us to 
    spread the greeting of salaam, and has enjoined us to return the greeting to 
    all Muslims. He has made the greeting of salaam one of the things that 
    spread love among the believers. 
Allaah says (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 
"" When you are greeted 
    with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it, or (at least) 
    return it equally. Certainly, Allaah is Ever a Careful Account Taker of all 
    things ""
[al-Nisa'4:86]
And it was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: 
    The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: ""You will not enter Paradise until you (truly) believe, and you will 
    not (truly) believe until you love one another. Shall I not tell you 
    something which, if you do it, you will love one another? Spread the 
    greeting of salaam amongst yourselves.""
Narrated by Muslim, 54. 
In the answer to question 
    no. 4596, 
    there is a lengthy discussion on the importance of greeting with salaam and 
    returning the greeting. 
Secondly: 
The command to spread the 
    greeting of salaam is general and applies to all the believers. It includes 
    men greeting men and women greeting women, and a man greeting his female 
    mahrams. All of them are enjoined to initiate the greeting of salaam, and 
    the other is obliged to return the greeting. 
But there is a special 
    ruling that applies to a man greeting a non-mahram woman, because of the 
    fitnah (temptation) that may result from that in some cases. 
Thirdly: 
There is nothing wrong with 
    a man greeting a non-mahram woman with salaam, without shaking hands with 
    her, if she is elderly, but he should not greet a young woman with salaams 
    when there is no guarantee that there will be no fitnah (temptation). This 
    is what is indicated by the comments of the scholars, may Allaah have mercy 
    on them.  
Imam Maalik was asked: Can 
    a woman be greeted with salaam? He said: With regard to the elderly woman, I 
    do not regard that as makrooh, but with regard to the young woman, I do not 
    like that. 
Al-Zarqaani explained the 
    reason why Maalik did not like that, in his commentary on al-Muwatta': 
    Because of the fear of fitnah when he hears her returning the greeting. 
In al-Adaab 
    al-Shar'iyyah (1/370) it says: Ibn Muflih mentioned that Ibn Mansoor 
    said to Imam Ahmad: (What about) greeting women with salaam? He said: If the 
    woman is old there is nothing wrong with it. 
Saalih (the son of Imam 
    Ahmad) said: I asked my father about greeting women with salaam. He said: 
    With regard to old women, there is nothing wrong with it, but with regard to 
    young women, they should not be prompted to speak by being made to return 
    the salaam. 
Al-Nawawi said in his book
    al-Adhkaar (p. 407): 
Our companions said: Women greeting women is 
    like men greeting to men. But when it comes to women greeting men, if the 
    woman is the man's wife, or his concubine, or one of his mahrams, then it is 
    like him speaking to another man; it is mustahabb for either of them to 
    initiate the greeting of salaam and the other is obliged to return the 
    greeting. But if the woman is a stranger (non-mahram), if she is beautiful 
    and there is the fear that he may be tempted by her, then the man should not 
    greet her with salaam, and if he does then it is not permissible for her to 
    reply; she should not initiate the greeting of salaam either, and if she 
    does, she does not deserve a response. If he responds then this is makrooh. 
If she is an old woman and 
    he will not be tempted by her, then it is permissible for her to greet the 
    man with salaam and for the man to return her salaams. 
If there is a group of 
    women then a man may greet them with salaam, or if there is a group of men, 
    they may greet a woman with salaam, so long as there there is no fear that 
    any of the parties may be tempted. 
Abu Dawood (5204) narrated that Asma' the 
    daughter of Yazeed said: ""The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) passed by us woman and greeted us with salaam."" Classed as saheeh 
    by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
And al-Bukhaari (6248) 
    narrated that Sahl ibn Sa'd said: ""There was an old woman of our 
    acquaintance who would send someone to Budaa'ah (a garden of date-palms in 
    Madeenah). She would take the roots of silq (a kind of vegetable) and put 
    them in a cooking pot with some powdered barley. After we had prayed 
    Jumu'ah, we would go and greet her, then she should offer (that food) to 
    us."" 
Al-Haafiz said in 
    al-Fath: 
Concerning the permissibility of men greeting 
    women with salaam and women greeting men: what is meant by its being 
    permitted is when there is no fear of fitnah. 
Al-Haleemi was quoted as 
    saying: Because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    was infallible and protected from fitnah. Whoever is confident that he will 
    be safe from temptation may greet (women) with salaam, otherwise it is safer 
    to keep silent. 
And al-Muhallab is quoted 
    as saying: It is permissible for men to greet women with salaam and for 
    women to greet men, if there is no fear of fitnah. 
And Allaah knows best.

39286,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39286,Is it correct to think that fatwas may vary according to time and place?,"I read the words: “The scholars are unanimously agreed that fatwas may change according to time, place, local custom and situation so it is essential to take new developments into account.” But I am not convinced of this. Is this view correct? I hope that you can answer with evidence from sharee’ah and the Sunnah. May Allah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This principle is expressed by some scholars in the words, “Changing rulings according to changing times is not to be denounced,” as it says in Majallat al-Ahkaam al-‘Adliyyah al-Maaddah, 39; Sharh al-Qawaa’id al-Fiqhiyyah by al-Zarqa, p. 227; and elsewhere. 
This is one of the principles that are derived from the principle of al-‘aadah muhakkamah (custom is a source for rulings). 
The word “rulings” here refers specifically to rulings that are based on custom and tradition. These are the rulings that may change according to time, place and circumstance. 
It says in Durar al-Hukkaam Sharh Majallat al-Ahkaam: “The rulings which may change according to time are the rulings that are based on customs and traditions, because as time changes, the people’s needs change. Based on this, changes also affect customs and traditions, and changes in custom and traditions change the rulings, as we have explained above. This is unlike the rulings that are derived from shar’i evidence and are not based on custom and tradition, which do not change. 
For example: the punishment for murder is execution. This shar’i ruling is not based on custom and tradition, and cannot be changed because of changing times. The rulings that can be changed as times change are those that are based on custom and tradition, as we have said. 
There follow some examples: In the view of the earlier fuqaha’, if a person wanted to buy a house, it was sufficient for him to see some of the rooms; but according to later fuqaha’, if a person wants to buy a house he has to see each and every room of it. This difference is not based on evidence, rather it stems from changes in customs and traditions regarding the way in which houses are built. That is because in the past, when a house was built the custom was for all its rooms to be the same, so if a person saw some of the rooms he had no need to see the rest. But nowadays the custom is that in one house the rooms vary in size and shape, so when buying a house it is essential to see all the rooms. 
From Durar al-Hukkaam, 1/47, by Shaykh ‘Ali Haydar. Similar comments are to be found in Sharh al-Majallah by Saleem Rustam, 1/36. 
Al-Zarqa described this principle by saying: 
Because sound character is rare nowadays, they said that testimony may be accepted from the best and then the next best, or from the least immoral then the next least immoral… 
They said that it is permissible to ask the witnesses to swear an oath, if the opponent insists on that, and if the judge deems it appropriate, because of the corrupt nature of the times. 
Sharh al-Qawaa’id al-Fiqhiyyah, p. 229/ 
Dr. Muhammad al-Zuhayli pointed out that the basic principle in sharee’ah is that rulings are fixed, and that the word “rulings” in this principle is not general in application. He said: “Hence the principle is specific and is an exception, whilst noting the following: 
1-The basic rulings that are established in the Qur’aan and Sunnah and which Islam brought in its basic texts – the commands and prohibitions, such as the prohibition on wrongdoing, adultery, riba, drinking alcohol and stealing, the obligation of mutual consent in contracts, of fighting crime and protecting people’s rights – none of these can be changed as times change. Rather they are principles that were brought by sharee’ah to guide all people at all times. All that changes is the means by which they are achieved.
2-The pillars of Islam and basic rulings that no Muslim has any excuse for not knowing cannot be changed. They remain fixed as they were narrated and as they were in the first era of Islam, because they are not open to change.
3-All the rulings on worship are not subject to individual opinion or ijtihaad, and cannot be changed because of different times, places, countries or individuals.
4-Matters of ‘aqeedah are also fixed and cannot be changed or altered, and are not subject to ijtihaad. They have been fixed from the time they were revealed and from the time of the earlier Prophets and Messengers, and will remain so until the Hour begins. They cannot change because of changing times.

Hence it becomes clear that there is no confusion about this principle, and that it does not provide proof for those who want to allow riba or mixing, for example, or who want to abolish the hudood punishments because the times have changed. The matters mentioned are firmly established in clear texts of the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and there is no room for changing or altering them, unless one wants to leave Islam altogether.

39288,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39288,Ghusl for deceased who is burned,"Should a deceased person who is burned be washed or not? And how should he be washed, kknowing that in some cases the person may be burned completely?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If a person dies from being burnt and it is possible to wash him, then he should be washed. But if there is the fear that the body may be damaged or caused to disintegrate by washing, then water should be poured over him; if there is the fear that this may cause the body to disintegrate, then tayammum should be done if possible. 
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The one who has been crushed by a falling wall, the one who has been burned and the one who has drowned should be washed if possible; if there is the fear that washing may cause the body to distingreate, then water should be poured over them without touching them. If there is the fear that water may cause the body to distintegarte, then they should not be washed, but tayammum should be done for them if possible, as in the case of a living person who may be harmed by water. If it is not possible to wash the deceased because there is no water available, then tayammum should be done, and if it is possible to wash some parts and not others, then those parts that can be washed should be washed, and tayammum should be done for the rest, as is the case of the living. 
End quote, from al-Mughni. 2/209. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
How should ghusl be done for a person who died in an accident and his body is disfigured and some parts may have been cut off? 
He replied: 
It is obligatory to wash him, just like anyone else, if that is possible. If it is not possible then tayammum should be done for him, because tayammum takes the place of washing with water when that is not possible. 
Majmoo’ Fatawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah, 13/123 
In Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (8/371) it says concerning ghusl for a person who died in an accident and whose body is cut in pieces: 
If it is not possible to wash him, then tayammum must be done for him, because of the general meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can”[al-Taghaabun 64:16]
because Allah has prescribed tayammum for purification from both major and minor impurity when there is no water available or when one is unable to use it, or when using it will cause harm.
