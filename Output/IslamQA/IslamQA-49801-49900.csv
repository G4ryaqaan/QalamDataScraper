49812,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49812,Consoling a parent for the loss of a daughter,My 16 year old daughter past away last October in the month of Shaaban from Cancer in her stomach. She was a good muslim that always prayed and seeked islamic knowlege. Is their anything I can do in the month of Ramadan that would increase her rewards? How can I deal with her loss. Please help?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.I ask 
    Allaah, may He be exalted, by His names and attributes, to encompass your 
    daughter in the vastness of His mercy and to join you with her on the Day of 
    Resurrection in His Paradise, and to grant you and her mother patience and 
    consolation. 
Accept the 
    glad tidings of the words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him): “Whoever dies of a stomach disease will not be punished in his 
    grave.” Narrated and classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi (1064); classed as 
    saheeh by al-Albaani in Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz (53). And the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever dies of a stomach 
    disease is a shaheed (martyr).” Narrated by Muslim (1915). Ibn al-Atheer 
    said: i.e., the one who dies of a stomach disease such as dropsy and the 
    like. Al-Nihaayah, 1/136. We hope that your daughter has attained 
    that by the grace and mercy of Allaah. 
Try not to 
    despair at her loss, and hope for goodness for her and reward from Allaah. 
    You should think and ponder and study the word of Allaah and the Sunnah of 
    His Prophet Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), for 
    therein you will find comfort and peace of mind which will bring 
    tranquillity and ease to those hope for the great reward which Allaah 
    bestows upon the one who is patient, accepts (Allaah’s decree) and seeks 
    reward. If the one who is faced with calamity compares what has been taken 
    from him with what he has been given of reward, he will find that what he 
    has been given of reward is far, far greater than that which he has lost. 
    All of that is in accordance with His wisdom.  
Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And 
    certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, 
    lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to As‑ Saabiroon (the patient).
    
156. Who, 
    when afflicted with calamity, say: “Truly, to Allaah we belong and truly, to 
    Him we shall return.”
157. They 
    are those on whom are the Salawaat (i.e. who are blessed and will be 
    forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His Mercy, and 
    it is they who are the guided ones”

    [al-Baqarah 2:155-157]
Muslim 
    narrated in his Saheeh (917) that Umm Salamah (may Allaah be pleased 
    with her) said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) say: “There is no person who is afflicted with a 
    calamity and says, ‘Verily to Allaah we belong and unto Him is our return. O 
    Allaah, reward me for my affliction and compensate me with something better’ 
    – but Allaah will reward him for his affliction and compensate him with 
    something better.” She said: When Abu Salamah died, I said: Who is better 
    than Abu Salamah, the companion of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him)? Then Allaah caused me to say it and I said 
    it. She said: Then I married the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
We also 
    present to you these following words of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) to console the one who has sent on one of 
    his children before him, whose child died during his lifetime, and to give 
    him the glad tidings of the mercy of Allaah and His favour upon him. May 
    Allaah encompass us and you therein, and bestow His pardon and forgiveness 
    upon us. 
Al-Tirmidhi 
    (2399) narrated and classed as hasan: “Calamity will continue to befall the 
    believer, male of female in himself, his child and his wealth, until he 
    meets Allaah with no sin on him.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in 
    Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 5815. 
It is 
    narrated in the hadeeth that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When a man’s child dies, Allaah, may 
    He be exalted, says to His angels: ‘Have you taken the soul of the child of 
    My slave?’ They say, ‘Yes.’ He says, although He knows best, ‘Have you taken 
    the apple of his eye?’ They say, ‘Yes.’ He says: ‘What did My slave say?” 
    They say: ‘He praised You and said Inna Lillaahi wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon 
    (Verily to Allaah we belong and unto Him is our return).’ Allaah, may He be 
    glorified and exalted, says: ‘Build a house for My slave in Paradise and 
    call it the house of praise.’” Narrated and classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi 
    (1021); classed as hasan by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah. 
These are 
    glad tidings that he would die in faith, because if Allaah commands that a 
    house be built for one of His slaves, that slave must be going to live in 
    that house one day… Imam Ahmad (3/436) narrated from the hadeeth of 
    Mu’aawiyah ibn Qurrah from his father, which al-Haakim (1/541) classed as 
    saheeh, that a man came to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) and he had a son of his with him. The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do you love him?” He said: “O 
    Messenger of Allaah, may Allaah love you as I love him.” Then the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) noticed that he was missing 
    and he said: “What happened to the son of So and so?” They said: “O 
    Messenger of Allaah, he has died.” The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to his father: “Would you not like to 
    come to one of the gates of Paradise and find him there waiting for you?” 
    The man said: “O Messenger of Allaah, is it just for me or for all of us?” 
    He  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No, it is for all 
    of you.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb 
    wa’l-Tarheeb, no. 1756. 
With regard 
    to what you can do for your daughter, there are several things:
1 – 
    Sincerely praying (du’aa’) for mercy and forgiveness. It was narrated that 
    Abu’l-Darda’ said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no Muslim who prays for his brother in 
    his absence but the angel says: And you shall have likewise.” Narrated by 
    Muslim, 2732. 
Shaykh Ibn 
    ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The best that one can do for 
    the deceased is say du’aa’. (Liqa’ al-baab il-Maftooh, 1/205) 
2 – Give 
    charity on her behalf, especially ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyah). 
    Al-Nawawi said: Charity reaches the deceased and he benefits from it, and 
    there is no difference of opinion among the Muslims concerning that. (Sharh 
    al-Nawawi ‘ala Saheeh Muslim, vol. 1, p. 89).
 There is no 
    saheeh evidence that charity given in Ramadaan receives a greater reward 
    than at other times, rather what is narrated is that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was the 
    most generous of people and he was at his most generous in Ramadaan, when 
    Jibreel met with him. He would meet with him every night in Ramadaan and 
    review the Qur’aan with him. And the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) was generous like the wind in doing good. 
    Al-Bukhaari (6), Muslim (2308). 
Al-Nawawi 
    said: This hadeeth teaches us several things, one of which is how generous 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was, and that 
    it is mustahabb to be generous in Ramadaan. End quote. Sharh al-Nawawi 
    ‘ala Saheeh Muslim, vol. 15, p. 69.

    book Fadl man maata lahu min al-Awlaad by al-Suyooti and a lecture

49821,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49821,Rights of a woman whose husband divorced her before consummating the marriage,"I am a revert to Islam and I would like to know what the woman's rights are from her husband who has been divorced without consumating the marriage when the man has put the woman in a financial hardship by leaving her with no money and no way to work? This Imam from Makkah married me, asked me to return to the US from another country where I had a job and apartment, promised me he would support me financially until he could get me to Saudi to be with him, then divorced me after 3 months IN AN E MAIL!!! saying it is only because he could not get me a visa easily, leaving me with no money at all, no Muslim family, and he said ""wallah I will send you money if you need it"" but never did. What are my rights from this man?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    I see in your question the reflection of a Muslim who is – I 
    think – sincere in religious commitment and free of ulterior motives and 
    greed. 

    I see in your question a soul who is at peace and a heart 
    that has faith in Allaah and believes in a deeply-rooted ‘aqeedah, in sha 
    Allah, that is not affected by the fact that fellow-believers have let you 
    down, or harmed by those who claim to believe in this ‘aqeedah but do not 
    follow it. 

    Yes, it is most upsetting when one sees some Muslims no 
    paying attention to the most important manners of interacting with others – 
    such as sincerity of speech, keeping promises, and fulfilling covenants – 
    when they read in the Book of Allaah the words (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “O you who believe! Fear Allaah, and be with those who are 
    true (in words and deeds)”

    [al-Tawbah 9:119] 

    “Those who fulfil the Covenant of Allaah and break not the 
    Mithaaq (bond, treaty, covenant)”

    [al-Ra’d 13:20] 

    “Those who fulfil the Covenant of Allaah and break not the 
    Mîthâq (bond, treaty, covenant)”

    [al-Baqarah 2:177]
And they hear the words 
    of the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “The 
    signs of the hypocrite are three: when he speaks, he lies; when he makes a 
    promise, he breaks it; and when he is entrusted with something he betrays 
    (that trust).” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 33; Muslim, 59. 

    Undoubtedly the situation of the Muslims nowadays is very 
    different from what it should be. 

    But despite that, do not despair or feel hopeless, for 
    goodness will abide in this ummah until the Day of Resurrection. 

    The troubles and calamities that a believer is faced with are 
    a test from Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Do people think that 
    they will be left alone because they say: ‘We believe,’ and will not be 
    tested?”

    [al-‘Ankaboot 29:2] 

    “And among mankind is he who worships Allaah as it were 
    upon the edge (i.e. in doubt): if good befalls him, he is content therewith; 
    but if a trial befalls him he turns back on his face (i.e. reverts to 
    disbelief after embracing Islam). He loses both this world and the 
    Hereafter. That is the evident loss” [al-Hajj 22:11]

    So you have to be patient and accept the will and decree of 
    Allaah, and have the hope of reward from Allaah. 

    With regard to your rights over him, firstly you must confirm 
    the divorce, because divorce via e-mail does not count unless it is 
    confirmed by the husband. See question no.
    36761. 

    When divorce has been confirmed, then what you can claim from 
    him through the qaadi (judge) is the mahr in full, if you had been alone 
    with him, or half of the mahr if you did not spend any time alone with him.

     Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 

    The evidence for that is the verse in which Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if you divorce them 
    before you have touched (had a sexual relation with) them, and you have 
    appointed unto them the Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife 
    at the time of marriage), then pay half of that (Mahr), unless they (the 
    women) agree to forego it, or he (the husband), in whose hands is the 
    marriage tie, agrees to forego and give her full appointed Mahr. And to 
    forego and give (her the full Mahr) is nearer to At-Taqwa (piety, 
    righteousness). And do not forget liberality between yourselves. Truly, 
    Allaah is All-Seer of what you do”

    [al-Baqarah 2:237]

    i.e., half of the mahr that you had agreed upon, and the rest 
    is to be given to them. We say: even if he was alone with her but did not 
    have intercourse with her, the same ruling applies, and she is entitled to 
    half. Most of the scholars are of this view concerning this issue. It was 
    narrated that there was consensus among the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased 
    with them) that if he had been alone with her then she was entitled to the 
    whole mahr; they regarded being alone with her as being like intercourse. 
    The reason for that was, as mentioned by Imam Ahmad, that it was permissible 
    for him to do with her what it was not permissible for anyone else to do. 
    Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 5/326. 
With regard to his 
    breaking his promise and the harm that he caused to you by making you give 
    up your work, and his breaking his vow, on the Day of Resurrection that will 
    bring you reward and add good deeds to your record in sha Allah.

Praise be to Allaah, I am well off and live with my father, but I hoped that Allaah would enable me to find work so that he will stop worrying about me sitting and not working or doing anything useful.

 Now I have found the opportunity to work in a private company that maintains and operates the Central Bank, on an annual contract and with a decent salary. Is the ruling on working for this company the same as the ruling on working in banks? I hope you can answer my question… What if I tell the company that I do not want to work in the bank and ask them to transfer me elsewhere – will the same ruling apply? Please note that I have not found work until now.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It is not permissible for you to work in the Central Bank 
    either directly or by working for a company that maintains and operates the 
    bank’s equipment, because this involves cooperating in sin and 
    transgression.

     This central bank is responsible for all the banks and for 
    deciding their interest rates (riba) and enforcing their regulations and 
    promulgating laws and systems that go against the laws of Allaah. 

    If you work for a maintenance and operation company there is 
    no reason why you should not maintain and operate companies that deal with 
    things that are permissible according to the rulings of sharee’ah, even if 
    your company has other branches that deal with things that are not 
    permissible. What is important for you is not to accept work in this field; 
    you should look for another field where you can operate and maintain things 
    that are permissible according to sharee’ah. 

    On this site you will find many fatwas concerning the ruling 
    on working for riba-based banks and for organizations that guard riba-based 
    banks or operate programs for them. We have quoted in these fatwas the 
    comments of the scholars stating that such jobs are haraam, and this applies 
    completely – if not more emphatically – to companies that take care of these 
    banks.

49834,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49834,The reason why a woman is not allowed to observe a naafil fast without her husband’s permission,"What is the reason why a woman is not allowed to observe a naafil fast without her husband’s permission even though that is an act of worship, and there is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Al-Bukhaari (5191) and Muslim (1026) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for a woman to fast when her husband is present except with his permission.” 
The version narrated by Abu Dawood (4258) and al-Tirmidhi (782) says: “No woman should fast when her husband is present except with his permission, apart from Ramadaan.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
Al-Haafiz said: i.e., when he is present and is not traveling. 
“Except with his permission” means apart from fasting the days of Ramadaan, and obligatory days apart from Ramadaan if there is not much time. This hadeeth indicates that it is haraam for her to observe the fast mentioned in the question without her husband’s permission. This is the view of the majority of scholars. 
This hadeeth indicates that the husband’s right over his wife takes precedence over her doing voluntary good deeds, because his right is an obligation and doing what is obligatory takes precedence over doing a voluntary action. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
This is to be understood as referring to voluntary and recommended fasts that are not to be done at a specific time. This prohibition was stated by our companions. The reason for that is that the husband has the right to be intimate with her on all days, and his right must be fulfilled immediately and cannot be delayed by a voluntary action or an obligatory action that could be done later on. If it is said that he should let her fast without his permission, and if he wants to be intimate with her he can do so and break her fast, the answer is that if she fasts, that usually prevents him from being intimate with her, because he would not want to spoil her fast.  
With regard to the questioner saying, “even though that is an act of worship, and there is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator” – 
We say: Yes, but if a woman does not observe a voluntary fast, that is not an act of disobedience or sin, rather what is sinful is not fasting in Ramadaan. Hence a woman should fast Ramadaan without her husband’s permission, as is indicated by the wording of the hadeeth narrated by Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi, quoted above. 
The husband’s rights take precedence over observing a naafil fast because this is something that is obligatory, and when there is a conflict regarding acts of worship, that which is more important takes precedence.

49836,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49836,‘Awrah for Men: Why Is the Man’s Chest Not Included?,"Since the reason for wearing clothes is to cover the ‘awrah and protect oneself from temptation, why is the man’s ‘awrah from the navel to the knees and does not include the chest, which is the most attractive part of a man’s body to the opposite sex? 
Some shaykhs told me that this is because women are affected by touch and men are affected by seeing. So why did the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) not allow ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) to sit with him when Ibn Umm Maktum – the blind man – visited him? And why did Allah reveal the verse which says: O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the Muslims women to lower their gaze?","Although the chest is not part of the ‘awrah for men, uncovering it is still an action that is not appropriate for a man and is one of the actions of the immoral.","Can women look at men who are not mahrams?


Can men show their chest in front of other men?


Islamic dress code: Why?


Taqwa: The best clothing


Purpose of outward clothing in Islam","Praise be to Allah.There is a mistake in the question concerning the hadith and verse mentioned, which we must point out before answering the question. 
With regard to the hadith, it makes no mention of ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), and moreover it is not sahih. 
Umm Salamah narrated that she was with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Maymunah. She said: Whilst we were with him, Ibn Umm Maktum came to him and entered upon him. This was after we had been commanded to observe hijab. So the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Observe hijab before him.” I said: “O Messenger of Allah, is he not a blind man who cannot see us or recognize us?” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Are you blind? Do you not see him?” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2778; Abu Dawud, 4112) 
The isnad of this hadith includes Nabhan the freed slave of Umm Salamah, who is majhul. It was classed as da’if by al-Albaani in Irwa al-Ghalil, 1806. 
With regard to the verse mentioned in the question, the questioner has mixed up two verses: 
The first is (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed. And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Ahzab 33:59]
and the second is (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts). That is purer for them. Verily, Allah is All-Aware of what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts)” [al-Nur 24:30-31]
Can women look at men who are not mahrams?
With regard to a woman looking at a man who is not her mahram, we have already stated in the answer to question no. 49038  that it is permissible subject to the condition that there are no feelings of desire or any risk of fitnah (temptation). 
Can men show their chest in front of other men?
The fact that a man’s ‘awrah is from the navel to the knee does not mean that it is permissible for a man to show his chest in front of other men, let alone in front of women. Although the chest is not part of the ‘awrah, uncovering it is still an action that is not appropriate for a man and is one of the actions of the immoral. 
It should be noted that if doing something permissible will result in some evil, then it is not allowed, because of the evil to which it leads. If a man’s uncovering his chest will be a cause of fitnah or will open the door to evil, then it should be disallowed for that reason. 
Islamic dress code: Why?
Clothing is prescribed for a number of reasons, such as: it is in accordance with the fitrah (sound natural inclinations of man); adornment; protection from heat and cold; and concealing the ‘awrah from the gaze of others. 
Taqwa: The best clothing
When Allah reminded His slaves of the blessing He bestowed upon them by creating clothing that covers them, He also drew attention to another kind of clothing which is better than that, namely the clothing or raiment of taqwa (piety, righteousness). 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O Children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover yourselves (screen your private parts) and as an adornment; and the raiment of righteousness, that is better. Such are among the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah, that they may remember (i.e. leave falsehood and follow truth). O Children of Adam! Let not Shaytan (Satan) deceive you, as he got your parents [Adam and Hawwa (Eve)] out of Paradise, stripping them of their raiments, to show them their private parts” [al-A’raf 7:26-27]
Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“Then He reminded them of the blessing that He had bestowed by making it easy for them to obtain clothing that is essential, and clothing that is worn for the purpose of beauty. The same applies to all things, food, drink, means of transportation, spouses, and so on. Allah has made it easy for His slaves to obtain what is necessary, and what is complementary to that, and He tells them that this is not something that is to be sought in and of itself, rather Allah sent it down to help them to worship and obey Him. Hence He says, “and the raiment of righteousness, that is better” than physical garments, for the garment of righteousness remains with a person and does not wear out. This refers to the beauty of the heart and soul. 
Purpose of outward clothing in Islam
With regard to outward clothing , its purpose is sometimes to conceal the outward ‘awrah and sometimes to adorn the wearer, and it serves no other purpose than these two. 
Not having something to wear means that a man is going to leave his ‘awrah exposed, which is allowable in cases of necessity, but if a person does not have the garment of righteousness then this will cause his inner ‘awrah to be exposed, which will lead to disgrace and humiliation. 
The phrase “Such are among the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah, that they may remember” means this is mentioned to you about clothing so that you may remember thereby that which benefits you and that which harms you, and you may seek the help of outward clothes to help you to acquire the garment of righteousness.” (Tafsir al-Sa’di, p. 248)

    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came from the campaign of Tabook or 
    Khaybar…” and he mentioned the hadeeth about the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) tearing down the curtain on which there 
    were images, that ‘Aa’ishah had put over her door. She said: And he 
    uncovered the niche in which were dolls that ‘Aa’ishah used to play with. He 
    said: “What is this, O ‘Aa’ishah?” She said: “My daughters (i.e., dolls).” 
    She said: And he saw among them a horse with two wings tied to it and said: 
    “What is this?” I said: “A horse.” He said:  “A horse with two wings?” I 
    said: “Have you not heard that Sulaymaan had horses with wings?” and he 
    smiled.

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    With regard to that which does not have complete features and 
    just has some limbs and a head, there is no doubt that this is permissible 
    and that it comes under the same heading as the dolls with which ‘Aa’ishah 
    (may Allaah be pleased with her) used to play.  

    As for that which has complete features, as if you were 
    looking at a person, especially if it can move or has a voice, then I feel 
    hesitant to say that this is permissible, because it is imitating the 
    creation of Allaah. It seems that the toys that ‘Aa’ishah used to play with 
    were not like this, so it is better to avoid them. But I do not say that it 
    is definitely haraam, because concessions may be granted to young children 
    that are not granted to adults in such matters, because it is the natural 
    inclination of young children to play and have fun and they are not obliged 
    to do acts of worship so that we could say that a child is wasting his time 
    with this play. But if a person wants to be on the safe side, let him remove 
    the head or hold it over the fire so that it becomes soft, then he can press 
    it so that the features disappear.

    2/277-278. 

    With regard to the 
    questioner’s asking whether it is permissible to start fasting later on of 
    this work, we do not understand exactly what he 
    means. If he means that this work invalidates his fast and what is 
    prescribed is to make up the fast later on, then he should not work in this 
    haraam job. We have already explained that all sins affect the fast and 
    reduce the reward, and may cancel out the reward altogether, if he does a 
    lot of sins, but that does not invalidate the fast and he is not commanded 
    to make it up. Rather he should refrain from committing these sins at all 
    times, especially in Ramadaan. See question no.

I hope that you can provide me with some evidence from the Qur’aan or Sunnah so that I can advise this girl. May Allaah reward you with all good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The fact that a woman who menstruates is obliged to make up missed fasts is a ruling on which there is consensus among the Muslims, and is indicated by the saheeh Sunnah and scholarly consensus. 
Al-Bukhaari (321) and Muslim (335) narrated that Mu’aadhah said: I asked ‘Aa’ishah: “Why does a woman who menstruates have to make up the fasts but not the prayers?” She said: “Are you a Haroori?” I said: “I am not a Haroori, but I am asking.” She said: “That used to happen to us and we were commanded to make up the fasts but we were not commanded to make up the prayers.” 
Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
This ruling is agreed upon. The Muslims are unanimously agreed that menstruating women and women who bleed following childbirth are not obliged to pray or fast at that time, and they are agreed that they do not have to make up the prayers, and they are agreed that they have to make up the fasts. The scholars said: the difference between them is that the prayers are many and repeated, and it would be too difficult to make them up, unlike the fast which is enjoined only once in the year, and a woman’s period may last only one or two days. 
Al-Haafiz said: 
“Are you a Haroori?” – the word Haroori is derived from Haroora’, which is a village two miles from Kufa. Those who believe in the madhhab of the Khaarijis are called Harooris because the first group of them rebelled against ‘Ali in that village, so they became known by this name. There are many such groups, but one of their basic principles on which they are all agreed is following what is indicated by the Qur’aan and rejecting additional evidence from the hadeeth. Hence ‘Aa’ishah asked Mu’aadhah this question by way of criticism.  
Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (3/39): 
The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is not permissible for menstruating women and women who bleed following childbirth to fast, and that they should not fast in Ramadaan, and should make up the missed days, and that if they do fast their fast does not count. 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (2/386): 
The ummah is also unanimously agreed that it is obligatory to make up missed Ramadaan fasts. Al-Tirmidhi, Ibn al-Mundhir, Ibn Jareer, our companions and others narrated that there was consensus on this point. 
Shaykh al-Islam said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (25/219): 
It is proven by the Sunnah and the consensus of the Muslims that menstrual bleeding invalidates the fast, so a menstruating woman should not fast, but she should make up the missed fast. 
This is the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and scholarly consensus on this matter was narrated by more than one of the scholars.  
So how can anyone then say that there is no evidence that a woman who menstruates has to make up missed fasts! 
This woman referred to in the question has to repent to Allaah from this wrong idea which implies rejection of the laws and rulings of Allaah. Whoever does not know something has to research and ask the scholars; it is not permissible for him to speak about the religion of Allaah without knowledge, because that is something that is forbidden. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): (But) the things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are Al-Fawaahish (great evil sins and every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse) whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in worship) with Allaah for which He has given no authority, and saying things about Allaah of which you have no knowledge”
[al-A’raaf 7:33]
The Muslim should realize that he is responsible for every word he says. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Not a word does he (or she) utter but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it)”
[Qaaf 50:18]

49860,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49860,He is asking about the grammar of the word al-Saabi’oon and how we can refute those who say that it is a grammatical error in the Qur’aan,"I would like to know about the grammar of the word al-saabi’oon in Soorat al-Maa’idah. Why does it appear in the nominative form (al-saabi’oon ) when it appears in another soorah in the accusative (al-saabi’een ), although the syntax in both passages is very similar? This was the cause of a great argument between myself and a Christian person who says that there are grammatical mistakes in the Qur’aan. I told him that I would leave Islam if there was a single grammatical mistake in the Qur’aan. I said this out of strong faith and certainty that the Qur’aan is the word of Allaah, glorified and exalted be He far above what the fabricators say.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The word al-Saabi’een  (in the accusative) appears in Soorat al-Baqarah and Soorat al-Hajj, where Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians [wa’l-saabi’een ], whoever believes in Allaah and the Last Day and does righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve”
[al-Baqarah 2:62] 
“Verily, those who believe (in Allaah and in His Messenger Muhammad), and those who are Jews, and the Sabians [wa’l-saabi’een], and the Christians, and the Majoos, and those who worship others besides Allaah; truly, Allaah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection. Verily, Allaah is over all things a Witness”
[al-Hajj 22:17]
The same word appears in the nominative form in Soorat al-Maa’idah, where Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Surely, those who believe (in the Oneness of Allaah, in His Messenger Muhammad and all that was revealed to him from Allaah), and those who are the Jews and the Sabians [wa’l-saabi’oon] and the Christians, — whosoever believed in Allaah and the Last Day, and worked righteousness, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve”
[al-Maa’idah 5:69]
In the first two verses, there is nothing difficult about the grammar, because the word al-saabi’een follows the conjunction waw (and) is in agreement with the word alladheena (those who); it is the noun of the particle inna (translated here as “verily”) and as such appears in the accusative form of the sound masculine plural, in accordance with the rules of Arabic grammar. 
Where the confusion arises is in the third verse quoted, from Soorat al-Maa'idah, where the word appears in the same position with regard to word order, but appears in the nominative form.  
The grammarians and mufassireen explained this in several ways, and they mentioned several well-known similar usages in Arabic. It is sufficient here to quote just three of them, which are among the most well known. 
1 – The word order in the verse differs from everyday usage. Based on that, the meaning is that those who believe, and those who are the Jews and the Christians, whosoever believed in Allaah … on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve, and the same applies to the Sabians. So the subject appears in the nominative, as is indicated by the waw of the sound masculine plural. There is a similar example in Arabic verse where the poet says: 
Faman yaku amsa bi’l-madeenati rahlahu       fa inni wa qayyaarun biha la ghareeb
(Whoever ends up in Madeenah with his saddle, then Qayyaar and I are strangers). 
The point here is that the word Qayyaar – which is the name of his horse or camel – appears in the nominative here (qayyaarun) because it is the subject. It does not appear in the accusative even though it is preceded by the particle inna (inni = inna + the yaa (i) which is the accusative suffix representing the first person singular pronoun following the particle inna).   
2 – The word al-saabi’oon is the subject and the word al-nasaara (Christians) is in agreement with it. The phrase man aamana Billaah (whoever believed in Allaah) is the predicate of al-saabi’oon . The predicate of inna is omitted here, as is indicated by the predicate of the subject al-saabi’oon . A similar usage in Arabic appears in the line of verse: 
Nahnu bima ‘indina wa anta bima    ‘indika raadin wa’l-amru mukhtalif
(We with what we have and you with what you have are content, even though it is different). 
The point here is that the subject nahnu (we) is not followed by its predicate, because the predicate of anta (you) is sufficient. The predicate of anta – raadin (content) – includes the predicate of the first subject, nahnu (we). What these words mean is: we are content with what we have and you are content with what you have. 
3 – The word al-saabi’oon appears in conjunction with the word that takes the place of the noun of inna. If any of these particles – inna and its “sisters” – comes at the beginning of a nominal sentence that is composed of a subject and predicate, the noun of inna was originally nominative because it is the subject, before the word inna was introduced. Hence the word al-saabi’oon  is nominative because it is a word that takes the place of the noun of inna. 
See Awdah al-Masaalik by Ibn Hishaam, with a commentary by Muhiy al-Deen (1/352-366); and the Tafseer al-Shawkaani wa’l-Aloosi, on this verse. 
What you have mentioned, about your certain faith in the words of Allaah, is what is expected of every Muslim. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Do they not then consider the Qur’aan carefully? Had it been from other than Allaah, they would surely, have found therein many a contradiction”
[al-Nisa’ 4:82]
One of the things of which we must be certain is that this phrase, with this pronunciation, was revealed like this. This is how it was pronounced by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), this is how the Muslims learned it from him and recited it, and wrote it in the Mus-hafs, and they were pure Arabs. This became a new principle by means of which we learned a new usage of conjunctions in Arabic, even though it is not a common usage, but it is very eloquent and evocative… (End quote) 
Ibn ‘Aashoor tried to explain the eloquence of this word al-saabi’oon  appearing in the nominative. He said words to the effect that: the nominative in this context is unusual, so it makes the reader pause and wonder why this word is put in the nominative, when it would usually appear in the accusative.  
See the commentary on the verse from al-Maa'idah in Tafseer Ibn ‘Aashoor. 
For more information on who the Sabians were, see the answer to the question: “49048”. 
But there are a few points that should be noted from this discussion: 
Firstly: We should take an interest in shar’i knowledge; it is not sufficient to rely only on faith that we already have in our hearts even though that is the greatest source of protection.  If shar’i (Islamic) knowledge is added to that then – in sha Allaah – it will give extra protection against doubts and confusion that the enemies of our religion may try to stir up. 
Secondly: questions like this draw attention to the extent of negligence concerning one of the most important duties that we have towards the Book of Allaah, which is the duty to study and ponder it, not just recite it. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“(This is) a Book (the Qur’aan) which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember”
[Saad 38:29]
Shaykh Ibn Sa’di (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This is the reason why it was revealed, so that people may ponder its verses, derive knowledge from it and contemplate its meanings and rulings. For by studying it and contemplating its meanings, and studying it time after time, they will attain its blessings and goodness. This indicates that we are encouraged to study the Qur’aan, and that this is one of the best of deeds, and that reading that includes pondering the meanings is better than a quick recitation that does not achieve this purpose. The evidence for this is that if we were to undertake this obligation time after time, these verses would cause us to stop and wonder about the meaning, so that we would ask about it and research it, before we are confronted with specious arguments from our enemies. 
Thirdly: If we undertook the two obligations referred to above, we would be qualified to take the initiative and call others, telling them of the truth that we have and informing them – in the best manner – of the falseness of their ways, instead of being on the defensive, weak and defeated.

He replied: 
It is permissible to fast these days one after the other or separately, and they may be at the beginning of the month, or in the middle, or at the end. The matter is broad in scope, praise be to Allah, because the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not state any specific days. ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) was asked: Did the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fast three days of each month?

Al-Ayyam al-Beed fasting in Sha’ban: Permissible?
 Perhaps the one who told you not to fast on those days in this month (Sha’ban) said that because he knew that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade fasting in the latter part of Sha’ban. 
In the answer to a question about making up missed Ramadan fasts in the second half of Sha’ban , we have explained that this prohibition applies to one who is starting to fast in the latter part of Sha’ban and does not have a prior habit of fasting. 
But if a person starts to fast in the first half of Sha’baan and continues to fast in the latter half, or he has a prior habit of fasting, then there is nothing wrong with him fasting in the latter half of Sha’baan, such as one who has the habit of fasting three days each month, or fasting on Mondays and Thursdays. 
Based on this, there is nothing wrong with you fasting three days in Sha’baan, even if some of those happen to be in the latter half of the month. 
Fasting in Sha’ban: Recommended?
There is nothing wrong with fasting a great deal in Sha’ban , indeed that is Sunnah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fast a great deal during this month.

Abu Salamah narrated that ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not fast in any month more than Sha’ban, and he used to fast all of Sha’ban and he used to say: “Do as much of good deeds as you can, for Allah does not get tired (of giving reward) until you get tired.” And the most beloved of prayers to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was that in which one persists even if it is little.

Exceptions to prohibition not  to fast after 15th Shaban","Praise be to Allah.Fasting after 15th Sha’ban 
It was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Sha’ban is halfway through, do not fast .” Narrated by Abu Dawud (3237); Ibn Hibban (1651); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi. 
Exceptions to prohibition not  to fast after 15th Shaban 
There are some exceptions from this prohibition, as follows: 
1- One who has a habit of fasting, such as a man who habitually fasts on Mondays and Thursdays , which he may do even after halfway through Sha’ban. The evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Do not anticipate Ramadan by fasting one or two days before it , except a man who fasts regularly, who should observe his usual fast.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1914; Muslim, 1082. 
2- A person who started fasting before halfway through Sha’ban, and connects what comes after the halfway point to what came before. This is not included in the prohibition either. The evidence for that is the words of ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fast all of Sha’ban and fast all of Sha’ban except a little.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1970; Muslim, 1165. This version narrated by Muslim) 
Al-Nawawi said: 
“He used to fast all of Sha’ban and fast all of Sha’ban except a little.” The second phrase is an explanation of the first, pointing out that by “all” what is meant is “most”. 
This hadith indicates that it is permissible to fast after halfway through Sha’ban, but only for one who joins that to what came before the halfway point. 
3- An exception from this prohibition is also made for one who is making up missed Ramadan fasts . 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmu’ (6/399): 
“Our companions said: it is not correct to fast on the “day of doubt” just before Ramadan, and there is no difference of scholarly opinion on this point … But if a person fasts it to make up a missed day or to fulfil a vow, or as an expiation, that is acceptable, because if it is permissible to observe a voluntary fast on that day, it is more likely to be permissible to observe an obligatory fast… and if a person has to make up a day from Ramadan, then he has to fast it, because the time left for him to make it up has become very short.” 
The “day of doubt ” is the thirtieth of Sha’ban if it has not been possible to sight the moon of the thirtieth because of cloud, fog, etc. It is called the “day of doubt” because there is some doubt concerning it – is it the last day of Sha’ban or the first day of Ramadan? 
In conclusion, there is nothing wrong with making up a missed Ramadan fast in the last half of Sha’ban. This is not included in the prohibition of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on fasting after halfway through Sha’ban. 
So your fasting of those three days is valid, and you have to fast the remaining days before Ramadan begins.

Can you pray in the train sitting down?","Praise be to Allah.Can you combine prayers when travelling?
It is permissible to join Dhuhr and `Asr prayers , and Maghrib and `Isha’ for one who is travelling. That is indicated by many hadiths, such as the following: 

Al-Bukhari (1108) narrated that Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) joined Maghrib and `Isha’ prayers when travelling. 
Ahmad (3178) narrated from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) joined two prayers whilst travelling. Shaykh Ahmad Shakir (3288) said: Its Isnad  (chain of narration) is authentic. 
Muslim (706) narrated that Mu’adh (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We went out with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on the campaign of Tabuk, and he used to pray Dhuhr and `Asr together, and Maghrib and `Isha’ together. 

Types of traveller 
A traveller may be of two types : 

When he is actually on the road
When he has made a stop, i.e., he is not on the road; either he has reached the place to which he is travelling, or he has made a stop on his journey and stayed there for a while. 

It is permissible for any traveller to join prayers , whether he has made a stop or is on the road. 
Is it better for the traveller to join the prayers?
But is it better for the traveller to join the prayers or to offer each prayer at its proper time? 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his essay on the times of the prayer (Mawaqit As-Salah, p. 26): 
It is better for the traveller who has made a stop not to join the prayers , but if he joins them there is nothing wrong with that, unless he needs to join them because he is tired and needs to rest, or because it is hard for him to find water each time, and so on, in which case it is better for him to join the prayers and avail himself of the concession. But for the traveller who is on the road, it is better for him to join Dhuhr and `Asr , and Maghrib and `Isha’ – in the way that is easier for him, either praying them at the time of the earlier prayer or the time of the later prayer. 
Based on this, it is better for you to avail yourself of the concession, and join Dhuhr and `Asr at the time of Dhuhr , because this is easier for you. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was never given the choice between two things but he would choose that which was easier, so long as it was not a sin, in which case he would be the most careful of people to avoid it. (Narrated by Muslim, 3560 and Muslim, 2327)
In this case you have to strive to pray `Asr in congregation and look for someone to pray with you. 
Can you pray in the train sitting down?
With regard to praying `Asr in the train whilst sitting , this is permissible according to the majority of scholars, if you cannot pray standing . 
It says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (8/120): 
“If the time for prayer comes and the plane is still in the air and there is the fear that the time for prayer will end before it lands, then the scholars are agreed that the prayer must be offered in whatever manner one can, bowing, prostrating and facing the Qiblah if possible, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.” [At-Taghabun 64:16]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If I tell you to do something, do as much of it as you can.” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim )
But if it is known that the plane will land before the time for prayer ends, and there will be enough time to offer the prayer or the prayer is one which can be joined with another – such as Dhuhr which may be joined with `Asr, or Maghrib which may be joined with `Isha’ – and it is known that the plane will land before the time for the second prayer ends and there will be enough time to offer the prayers, then the majority of scholars are of the view that it is permissible to offer the prayers in the plane, because it is obligatory to offer them when the time for prayer begins, in whatever manner one can, as stated above. This is the correct view.” 
And it also says (8/126): 
“It is not permissible to pray sitting down in a plane or elsewhere if one is able to stand, because of the general meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And stand before Allah with obedience.” [Al-Baqarah 2:238]
And the Hadith of `Imran ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) which was narrated by Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him): that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Pray standing, and if you cannot, then sitting, and if you cannot, then on your side.” An-Nasa’i added, with an authentic Isnad: “And if you cannot, then lying on your back.”” 
Some of the scholars are of the view that it is not permissible to pray in planes, trains or cars because it is not possible to offer the prayer as it is offered when standing on the ground – unless there is the fear that the time for the prayer will end. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Fatawa Arkan Al-Islam (p. 380): 
“It is obligatory to pray in a plane if one does not know the time of the prayer, but if he cannot offer the prayer in the plane as he offers it on the ground, then he should not offer obligatory prayers in the plane if the plane will land before the time for prayer is over, or the time for the following prayer if it is a prayer that may be joined with another. For example, if a plane takes off from Jeddah just before sunset and the sun sets whilst it is in the air, he should not pray Maghrib until the plane lands and he disembarks. But if he fears that the time will end and he intends to join it to `Isha’ at the time of the latter, he can pray them when he lands. But if the plane keeps on flying and there is the fear that the time for `Isha’ will end, which is at midnight, then he should pray them in the plane before the time ends.” 
Based on this, in order to be on the safe side, you should not pray `Asr in the train , rather you should join it with Dhuhr at the time of Dhuhr, as stated above.

49886,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49886,Is it permissible to move books that have been donated to one mosque as a waqf to another mosque?,Is it permissible to move books from one mosque to another? How? Who has the right to do that? Are there any conditions?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 
The basic principle is 
    that things that have been donated as a waqf to a specific mosque should not 
    be moved elsewhere, because the one who donated them gave them to that 
    specific mosque, so it is not permissible to move them elsewhere. 

    Secondly: 

    Some of the scholars stated that it is permissible – and this 
    is the correct view – to move them to another mosque so long as moving them 
    is more beneficial than leaving them where they are, such as if there are 
    more people who will benefit from them in the second mosque than in the 
    first; or if there is a number of daa’iyahs and seekers of knowledge who 
    will benefit from them and benefit others. 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said: 

    It is permissible to change the conditions stipulated by the 
    waqf donor to something that is more beneficial, even if that varies with 
    time, such as if a person set up a waqf for the fuqaha’, but then the people 
    need jihad, in which case it may be given to the troops. End quote. 

    Al-Ikhtiyaaraat, p. 176 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen 
    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said about changing some conditions 
    stipulated by the donor to something that is better: 

    This is an issue concerning which the scholars differed. Some 
    of them said that if the donor stipulated conditions in the waqf, but the 
    person in charge thinks that something else is better for the people and 
    will bring a greater reward, then there is nothing wrong with him changing 
    it. Some of them disallowed that and said that this man gave this wealth in 
    a certain manner so it is not permissible to dispose of it except in the 
    manner that he stipulated. 

    Those who say that it is permissible say that the idea behind 
    waqf is kindness so whatever is kinder is more beneficial to the one who 
    donated the waqf. They quoted as evidence the fact that a man came to the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) during the year of 
    the conquest (of Makkah) and said: “O Messenger of Allaah, I vowed that if 
    Allaah enabled you to conquer Makkah, I would pray in Bayt al-Maqdis 
    (Jerusalem).” He said: “Pray here.” He repeated what he had said, and (the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) said: “Pray here.” 
    He repeated it and he said: “Pray here.” He repeated it and he said, “It is 
    up to you then.” 

    A waqf is like a vow, so if the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) permitted the one who had made a vow to 
    change it to that which was better, then the same applies to one who has 
    donated a waqf. This is the correct view, that it is permissible to change 
    the conditions stipulated by the waqf donor to that which is better, so long 
    as the waqf is not donated for the benefit of a specific person. If the waqf 
    is donated for a specific person then it is not permissible to change it to 
    something that is better, because it is specific and the right belongs to a 
    specific person, so it cannot be changed. End quote from al-Sharh 
    al-Mumti’, 9/560, 561 

    Thirdly: 
With regard to who has 
    the right to do that, it is the one who is in charge of the waqf, who has 
    been appointed by the one who donated these books as a waqf. If there is no 
    such person, then reference should be made to the body that is responsible 
    for these books, such as the ministry of awqaaf in a Muslim country.

My question is: Is it possible to do more than one `Umrah? i.e., can we do `Umrah then wait a while and enter ihram again and do another `Umrah? How long should we wait between two `Umrahs?",There is nothing wrong with repeating `Umrah. The Prophet encouraged us to do `Umrah and he did not define the time period that should elapse between two `Umrahs.,,"Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with repeating `Umrah . The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) encouraged us to do `Umrah and he did not define the time period that should elapse between two `Umrahs. 
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni: 
“There is nothing wrong with doing `Umrah several times in the year . That was narrated from `Ali, Ibn `Umar, Ibn `Abbas, Anas, `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with them), and `Ata’, Tawus, `Ikrimah and Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on them), because `Aishah did `Umrah twice in one month on the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “From one `Umrah to another is expiation for whatever (sins) come between them.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)  
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (17/432): Is it permissible to perform `Umrah repeatedly in Ramadan, seeking the reward for that?
 He replied: 
“There is nothing wrong with that. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “From one `Umrah to another is expiation for whatever (sins) come between them, and an accepted Hajj brings no less a reward than Paradise.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1773 and Muslim, 1349) 
If a person does `Umrah three or four times, there is nothing wrong with that. At the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), at the Farewell Pilgrimage, `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) did `Umrah twice within a space of less than twenty days. 
And the Standing Committee was asked (11/337): 
I live in a town 100 kilometers away from Makkah. In Ramadan every year I go to Makkah for `Umrah, and I pray Jumu`ah and `Asr there, then I go back to my town. I discussed that with some of my brothers and they said that it is not permissible to do `Umrah every week in Ramadan. 
They replied: 
“If the situation is as you describe, that is permissible, because there is no text that specifies the length of time that should elapse between one `Umrah and the next. 
Some scholars are of the view that time should be allowed between two `Umrahs for hair to grow that the pilgrim can shave in the second `Umrah. This time period is approximately one week or ten days. 
Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` (7/242): 
“Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: he should not do `Umrah until his head has turned black with hair. 
Based on this, what many people do nowadays of performing `Umrah repeatedly, especially in the month of Ramadan every day, or once each day and once each night, is contrary to what the Salaf used to do. 
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni: 
“`Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said (`Umrah may be done) once each month. When his hair had grown back, Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) would go out and do `Umrah again. Both reports were narrated by Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him) in his Musnad. `Ikrimah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: He should do `Umrah when his hair can be shaved by the razor. `Ata’ said: If he wishes he can do `Umrah twice each month. Ahmad said: If he does `Umrah, then he has to shave his head or cut his hair. In ten days he can shave his head.” 
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 26/45: 
“What Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) stated is that it is not recommended to repeat `Umrah often from Makkah or elsewhere , rather one should allow time in between for the hair to grow back so that it can be shaved.”

49898,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49898,Conditions of women going out to the mosque,Is it permissible for women to go and pray tahajjud in the mosque without a mahram when the mosque is next to the house and the men in the family do not do this prayer?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for women to go to the mosque and pray, subject to certain conditions. It is not one of these conditions that she should be accompanied by a mahram, so there is nothing wrong with her going to the mosque to pray without a mahram. 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 7/332: 
It is permissible for a Muslim woman to pray in the mosque and her husband does not have the right to stop her if she asks him for permission to do that, so long as she is properly covered and no part of her body is showing that it is forbidden for “strangers” (non mahrams) to see. It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “When your womenfolk ask you for permission to go to the mosque, give them permission.” According to another version, “Do not forbid women their share of the mosques if they ask you for permission.” Bilaal – a son of ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar – said, “By Allah, we will stop them.” ‘Abd-Allah said to him, “I say ‘The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said…’ and you say, ‘We will stop them’?!” Both reports were narrated by Muslim. 
If the woman is uncovered and any part of her body is showing that it is forbidden for “strangers” (non mahrams) to see, or she is wearing perfume, then it is not permissible for her to go out of her house in this state, let alone go out to the mosque and pray there, because of the fitnah (temptation) involved. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent (like both eyes for necessity to see the way, or outer palms of hands or one eye or dress like veil, gloves, headcover, apron), and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms) and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands…” [al-Noor 24:31] 
“O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed. And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Ahzaab 33:59]
Zaynab al-Thaqafiyyah used to narrate that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If any one of you (women) attends ‘Isha’ prayer, let her not put on perfume that night.” According to another report, “If any one of you (women) attends the mosque, let her not put on perfume that night.” Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh. 
It was proven in saheeh ahaadeeth that the women of the Sahaabah used to attend Fajr prayer in congregation, covering their faces, so that no one would recognize them. It was proven that ‘Amrah bint ‘Abd al-Rahmaan said: I heard ‘Aa’ishah, the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), say: “If the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had seen the way the women are behaving, he would have forbidden them to go to the mosque as the women of the Children of Israel were forbidden.” It was said to ‘Amrah: Were the women of the Children of Israel forbidden to go to the mosque? She said: Yes. Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh. 
These texts clearly indicate that if the Muslim woman adheres to proper Islamic etiquette in her dress and avoids adorning herself in ways that will provoke fitnah and affect those of weak faith, there is no reason why she should not pray in the mosque. If she appears in such a way that evil people and those in whose heart is a disease will be tempted by her, then she is not allowed to enter the mosque, rather she is not allowed to leave her home and attend the mosque. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 14/211: 
There is nothing wrong with women attending taraaweeh prayers if there is no danger of fitnah, subject to the condition that they go out looking decent and not wearing adornments, make-up or perfume. 
In his book Hiraasat al-Fadeelah (p. 86), Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd listed the conditions for women to go out to the mosque. He said: 
Women are allowed to go out to the mosque according to the following rulings: 
1-That there is no risk of them tempting others or being tempted
2-That their attendance will not lead to anything that is forbidden according to sharee’ah
3-That they do not jostle with men in the street or in the mosque
4-That they should go out not wearing perfume
5-That they should go out wearing hijab, not making a wanton display of their adornment
6-A door should be set aside in the mosque just for women to enter and exit, as mentioned in the hadeeth narrated in Sunan Abi Dawood and elsewhere.
7-The women’s rows should be behind the men
8-The best rows for women are those at the back, unlike the case for men
9-If the imam makes any mistake in his prayer, men should say “Subhan Allah!” and women should clap
10-The women should leave the mosque before the men, and the men should wait until the women have dispersed to their homes, as mentioned in the hadeeth of Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) in Saheeh al-Bukhaari and elsewhere.",Islam Q&A

I distributed part of it, and I am still distributing what is left, but at the same time I need some money because I am about to get married and to finish building my house which is not yet completed. And I am also in debt. Am I entitled to take some of the zakaah or not? 
Please note that I cannot tell this to my friend at present",,,"Praise be to Allah.You do not have the right to take anything from this money, because your friend only gave it to you so that you could distribute it to others, not to take it. You are an agent of the person who gave you the money, and you are only allowed to dispose of it in the manner that he gave you permission to do. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked in Fataawa Arkaan al-Islam (p. 447) about a poor man taking zakaah from a wealthy man on the basis that he would distribute it for him, then taking it himself: what is the ruling on doing this? 
He replied: 
This is haraam and is a betrayal of trust, because the owner gave it to him on the basis that he would act as his agent and give it to others, but he is taking it for himself. The scholars stated that it is not permissible for an agent to use that which he has been appointed to dispose of for himself. Based on this, this person has to tell his companion that he took for himself what was given to him before. If he allows him that, all well and good, otherwise he has to pay it back, by giving back what he took so that it may be given in zakaah on behalf of its owner. 
I would like to take this opportunity to speak about something that some ignorant people do, which is when a poor person takes zakaah, then Allaah makes him independent of means but people still give to him, thinking that he is still poor, and he takes it. Some of these people take it and consume it, then say, “I did not ask people for it, this is provision which Allaah has bestowed upon me.” This is haraam, because if Allaah makes a person independent of means, it is haraam for him to take any zakaah. 
Some people take zakaah then give it to others without being appointed to do so by the owner of the zakaah. This is also haraam. It is not permissible for a person to dispose of it in this manner, even if it is less serious than the case described above, but it is still haraam for him to do this, and he has to pay back the zakaah to its owner if he did not give him permission and does not approve of his action. 
The Standing Committee (9/436) was asked: 
Some people have given me zakaah to dispose of it in the ways prescribed in sharee’ah. I took the money and distributed some of it, but I took some for myself, because I needed this money so that I could get married and fix up my house which was not suitable for getting married. I had the intention of paying it back, but my circumstances now do not allow me to pay it back. What is the solution? Was it halaal or haraam for me to take this money? Do I have to pay it back? 
They replied: 
It is not permissible for you to take this money that was given to you so that you could distribute it to those who are entitled to zakaah. You have to return the money that you took, or give it to those who are entitled to it, and also repent and seek forgiveness for what you did.",Islam Q&A
