39502,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39502,"A vehicle overturned in front of him and he hit it, and two people died","I was driving my car at a speed of 80 kph, which is less than the speed limit for that type of road, a two-lane coastal highway. Suddenly a bus came in the opposite direction, crossed the central reservation and overturned in front of me. I hit it straightaway because I could not avoid it, as it came out so suddenly. Two of the bus passengers died, and when I asked the passengers who were rescued from the accident they told me that the driver of the bus was not the original driver and he did not have a licence.

 My question is: do I have to offer expiation or pay the diyah (blood money) or not?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If the matter is as you say, and you were travelling under the speed limit, and you were unable 
    to avoid hitting the bus, because it came out so suddenly and overturned in front of you, then there is no blame on you and you do not have to pay 
    the diyah or offer any expiation, because you did not break the rules and you were not negligent. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about a person whose car 
    overturned, and his father who was travelling with him died – does he have to offer any expiation? 
He said: It is essential to determine the cause of the accident; if it was caused by negligence 
    or breaking the rules, then he has to pay the diyah and offer expiation. If it was not caused by breaking the rules or negligence on his part them 
    he does not have to do anything. 
Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/357. 
The Standing Committee was asked a similar question and replied: 
If the driver was negligent or there is a reason that caused 
    the accident such as his breaking the rules or driving too fast, or he was drowsy and so on, or he was negligent in checking his car or neglected 
    some safety precaution, then he has to offer the expiation for killing, which is freeing a believing slave; if he cannot do that then he has to 
    fast for two consecutive months as an act of repentance to Allaah. If he did not cause the accident in any way, then he does not have to do 
    anything.
Fataawa Islamiyyah, 2/356 
It says in a report of the Islamic Fiqh Council, issued during 
    its eighth conference in 1414 AH (1993 CE) concerning situations in which a driver is exonerated of blame:
(a)If the accident happened as the result of reasons beyond his control, and he was unable to avoid it; 
    this includes anything that is beyond man’s control.
(b)If it was mostly caused by the one who was harmed.
Majallat al-Majma’ al-Fiqhi, issue no 8, part 2, p. 372.
This applies in your case.

39505,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39505,Interest based loans,"The state has allocated special funds for business start-up for unemployed youth who have graduated from university. This fund is divided into two sections: 
1 – 30% of the costs of start-up are paid by this fund. This money is to be paid back over 5 years, without interest. 
2 – 70% of the costs are paid by the national bank. This money is to be paid back over 5 years with interest at a rate of 4%. 
What is the Islamic ruling on this scheme?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is no problem with the first kind of funding, because it is a kind of goodly loan (al-qard al-hasan).
 But the second kind is a riba-based loan which is haram, no matter what the rate of interest. Imam Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Every loan in which it is stipulated that something extra must be paid back is haram, with no difference of scholarly opinion. Ibn al-Mundhir said: [the scholars] are unanimously agreed that if the lender stipulates that the borrower must pay extra or give him a gift, and he lends him money on that basis, then accepting the extra payment is riba. It was narrated from Ubayy ibn Ka’b, Ibn ‘Abbaas and Ibn Mas’ood that they forbade every loan that brings benefits, because loans should be given as an act of kindness and an act of worship aimed at bringing one closer to Allah. So if there is a stipulation of extra payment, this diverts the loan from its purpose.” 
Al-Mughni, 6/436. 
If you can apply for the first kind of funding, there is no sin on you, because it is permissible, as we have mentioned. 
But if that is subject to the condition that you also apply for the second kind, then it is haram to do that.

 The Standing Committee was asked: is it permissible to buy chickens and sheep by 
    weight, whether they are alive or have been slaughtered? 
They replied: the basic principle is that transactions between Muslims are 
    permissible except those which are forbidden by a shar’i text. Hence we know that it is permissible to buy chickens and sheep by weight, and we 
    know of no reason in sharee’ah why that should not be allowed.
Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 
    13/290
 And it also says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 13/290:
 It is permissible to sell sheep and other animals live by weight, whether they 
    are weighed by kilograms or otherwise, because the purpose is to decide how much they are worth, which is decided by weight.
 And it also says (13/289): It is permissible to sell animals by weight, and it is 
    permissible to sell them by sight without weighing them, according to scholarly consensus. The permissibility of selling them by weight is not 
    affected by what is in its stomach of food etc., because that is part of it. So it is permissible to sell them by weight.

1 – If the man buys this car for you in return for a wage which will be given to 
    him for doing this job. So he is your agent acting on your behalf in making this purchase. In that case it is not permissible for him to take 
    anything but the wage that you have agreed upon. Any reduction in the price of the car, or taxes that are refunded, or gifts given to the agent 
    because of this transaction, should all be given to you (the one who appointed him) unless you willingly let him have anything of that, because 
    any rights connected to this contract belong to the one who appoints the agent. 
Ibn Qudaamah said: Ahmad said, according to one of the reports narrated from him: If a man is 
    given a garment to sell, and he does that, and the purchaser gives him a handkerchief, then the handkerchief belongs to the (original) owner of 
    the garment. He said that because the reason why the handkerchief was given was the sale, and the handkerchief was in addition to the price paid, 
    so anything extra that is given when the transaction is made is connected to it. 
End quote, from al-Mughni, 5/82. 
2 – If the man buys the car, then sells it to you. In this case he may increase 
    the price and add the tax to it, whether he gets it back or not. But it is not permissible for you to buy it from him until he has taken 
    possession of the car in a real sense, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Hakeem ibn Hizaam: “If you buy 
    something, then do not sell it until you have taken possession of it.” Narrated by Ahmad, 15399; al-Nasaa’i, 4613; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani

Al-Daaraqutni and Abu Dawood (3499) narrated from Zayd ibn Thaabit that the

    own luggage.” This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
In al-Saheehayn it is narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever buys food, let him not sell it until he obtains it.” Al-Bukhaari, 2132; Muslim, 1525. Muslim added: Ibn ‘Abbaas said: I think all other products are the same, i.e., there is no difference between food and other things in this regard.

39524,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39524,Ruling on ‘Umrah,Is ‘Umrah obligatory or Sunnah?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars are agreed that ‘Umrah is prescribed in Islam and is an act of virtue. 
They differed as to whether it is obligatory. Imam Abu Haneefah and Imam Maalik were of the view that it is Sunnah and mustahabb, but not obligatory; this was also the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah. 
They quoted as evidence for that the hadeeth narrated by al-Tirmidhi  (931) from Jaabir, who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked whether ‘Umrah is obligatory. He said, “No, but if you do ‘Umrah it is better.” 
But this hadeeth is da’eef (weak); it was classed as da’eef by al-Shaafa’i, Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr, Ibn Hajar and al-Nawawi; by al-Albaani in Da’eef al-Tirmidhi, and by others. 
Al-Shaafa’i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is da’eef and cannot be used as evidence. There is nothing proven that says that ‘Umrah is a voluntary act of worship.  
Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: This was narrated with isnaads that are not valid, and such reports cannot be used as evidence. 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (7/6): the scholars of hadeeth are agreed that it is da’eef. 
One of the things that indicate that this is da’eef is the fact that it was proven that Jaabir was of the view that ‘Umrah is obligatory, as we shall see below.  
Imam al-Shaafa’i and Imam Ahmad were of the view that it is obligatory. This view was also favoured by Imam al-Bukhaari. (May Allah have mercy on them all). 
Those who say that it is obligatory quoted a number of things as evidence: 
1 – The report narrated by Ibn Maajah (2901) from ‘Aa’ishah who said: “I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, do women have to engage in jihad?’ He said, ‘Yes, they must do jihad in which there is no fighting: Hajj and ‘Umrah,’” 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (7/4): Its isnaad is saheeh according to the conditions of al-Bukhaari and Muslim. It was also classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. 
The point in this hadeeth is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said alayhinna i.e., they must do, which means that it is obligatory. 
2 – The famous hadeeth of Jibreel (peace be upon him) in which he asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about Islam, eemaan (faith) and ihsaan, and about the Hour and its signs. This was narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah and al-Daaraqutni from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him), in which ‘Umrah was mentioned along with Hajj: “Islam means to bear witness that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; to establish regular prayer; to pay the zakaah; to perform Hajj and ‘Umrah to the House; to do ghusl to cleanse oneself from janaabah (impurity following sexual activity) and to do wudoo’ perfectly; and to fast Ramadaan.” Al-Daaraqutni said, “This isnaad is proven and saheeh.” 
3 – The hadeeth narrated by Abu Dawood (1799) and al-Nasaa’i (2719) from al-Subay ibn Ma’bad who said: “I was a Christian Bedouin… I came to ‘Umar and said, ‘O Ameer al-Mu’mineen, I have become Muslim and I found that Hajj and ‘Umrah are prescribed for me, so I entered ihraam for them.’ ‘Umar said, ‘You have been guided to the Sunnah of your Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).’” 
4 – The opinion of a group of the Sahaabah, including Ibn ‘Abbaas, Ibn ‘Umar and Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with them all). Jaabir said, There is no Muslim for whom ‘Umrah is not obligatory. Al-Haafiz said: This was narrated by Ibn Jahm al-Maaliki with a hasan isnaad. 
Al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Chapter: The obligation of ‘Umrah and its virtues.” Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: There is no one who does not have to do Hajj and ‘Umrah. Ibn ‘Abbaas said: It is mentioned together with Hajj in the Book of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And perform properly (i.e. all the ceremonies according to the ways of Prophet Muhammad), the Hajj and ‘Umrah (i.e. the pilgrimage to Makkah) for Allah” [al-Baqarah 2:196]
Because it is mentioned together with Hajj, this means that it is obligatory like Hajj. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz said: The correct view is that ‘Umrah is obligatory once in a lifetime, like Hajj. Fatawa Ibn Baaz, 16/355. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (7/9): The scholars differed concerning ‘Umrah and whether it is obligatory or Sunnah. It seems to us that it is obligatory. 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 11/317 
The correct one of the two scholarly views is that ‘Umrah is obligatory, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And perform properly (i.e. all the ceremonies according to the ways of Prophet Muhammad), the Hajj and ‘Umrah (i.e. the pilgrimage to Makkah) for Allah” [al-Baqarah 2:196]
And because of the ahaadeeth which say that.

39570,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39570,Can Muslim Women Wear Coloured Hijab?,"Is it haram for a woman to wear colored clothes even if it fulfills the conditions of hijab? If it is haram, then is there a hadith or verse to prove that? What is meant by saying it should not be an adornment in itself?","A Muslim woman may wear whatever she wants, so long as she does not wear a colour that is only for men, and she does not wear a garment that is an adornment in itself.","Must a Muslim woman be dressed in black?


What should women do if they appear before non-mahram men?","Praise be to Allah.Must a Muslim woman be dressed in black?
The conditions of the hijab of the Muslim woman have already been explained in the answer to question no. 6991 . 
It is not one of these conditions that it should be black. A woman may wear whatever she wants, so long as she does not wear a colour that is only for men, and she does not wear a garment that is an adornment in itself, i.e., decorated and adorned in such a way that it attracts the gaze of men , because of the general meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“…and not to show off their adornment…” [al-Nur 24:31]
This general meaning includes the outer garment, if it is decorated. Abu Dawud (565) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not prevent the female slaves of Allah from attending the mosques of Allah , but let them go out unadorned.” (Classed as authentic by al-Albani in Irwa al-Ghalil, 515) 
It says in ‘Awn al-Ma’bud: 
“‘Unadorned’ means not wearing perfume … they are commanded to go out like this and are forbidden to wear perfume lest they provoke men’s desires with their perfume. That also includes other things which are forbidden because they provoke desire, such as beautiful clothing and visible and expensive adornment.” 
What should women do if they appear before non-mahram men?
What a woman must do if she appears before non-mahram men is to avoid clothes that are decorated and adorned, which attract the gaze of men. 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah (17/100): 
“It is not permissible for a woman to go out in a decorated garment that attracts people’s gaze, because this is something that tempts men.”
It also says (17/108): 
“The dress of the Muslim woman need not only be black. It is permissible for her to wear any colour of clothing so long as it covers her ‘awrah , does not resemble men’s clothing, and is not so tight as to show the shape of her limbs or so thin as to show what is beneath it, and does not provoke temptation. 
And it says (17/109): 
“Wearing black for women is not a must. They may wear other colours that are worn only by women, do not attract attention and do not provoke desire.”
Many women choose to wear black, not because it is obligatory, but because it is farthest removed from being an adornment. There are reports which indicate that the female Companions used to wear black. Abu Dawud (4101) narrated that Umm Salamah said: “When the words ‘and to draw their veils all over Juyubihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)’ [al-Nur 24:31 – interpretation of the meaning] were revealed, the women of the Ansar went out looking as if there were crows on their heads because of their garments.” (Classed as authentic by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud) 
The Standing Committee (17/110) said: “This is to be understood as meaning that those clothes were black in colour.”
