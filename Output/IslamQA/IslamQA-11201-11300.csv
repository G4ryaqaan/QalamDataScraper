      No, this (i.e., fish) is not merchandise. It is like the case if he were to go fishing every day and eat what he caught.

11220,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11220,What is the meaning of Allaah’s name al-Muqeet?,"What is the meaning of Allaah’s name al-Muqeet (The Ever All-Able, All-Witness)?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Ibn
      Jareer mentioned a number of opinions concerning the meaning of this name:
      al-Muqeet means al-Hafeez (the Protector), al-Shaheed (the Witness),
      al-Hasab (the Sufficient), the One Who is in control of all things. He
      thought that the last interpretation is the correct one.
 Allaah
      is al-Muqeet, i.e., the Protector, the Witness, the One Who is Able to do
      all things.
 Al-Muqeet
      is the Preserver, the Omnipotent, the Witness; He is the One Who sends
      down provision to His creatures and shares it out among them.
 Al-Muqeet
      is the Sustainer; He is taking care of all living beings, for when He
      causes parts of them to die over time, He compensates for that. At every
      moment He gives them what they need to survive, until He wills to put an
      end to their life – then He withholds what keeps them alive, and so they
      die.
 Some
      reports give the name al-Mugheeth instead of al-Muqeet. Al-Mugheeth is
      interpreted as meaning the Helper, for He helps His slaves at times of
      difficulty when they call upon Him; He answers them and saves them. It
      also has the meaning of the One Who responds and the One Who is called
      upon. Ighaathah [help] refers to actions and istijaabah [responding]
      refers to words, but they may be used interchangeably.
 Ibn
      al-Qayyim said:
“He
      is the Helper of all His creatures, and He responds to those who are
      desperate.”","Sharh Asmaa’ Allaah ta’aala al-Husna by Dr. Hissah al-Sagheer, p. 246"

11233,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11233,Referring to the International Court of Justice,What is the ruling on referring matters to the International Court of Justice?,,,"Praise be to Allah.The saheeh evidence of the Qur’aan and Sunnah indicates 
          that it is obligatory for all the Muslims – on the individual, community, 
          governmental and international levels – to refer any disputes or arguments 
          that arise among them to the laws of Allaah, and to submit to Him and 
          accept His laws. Among this clear evidence are the aayahs (interpretation 
          of the meaning): 
“But 
          no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, 
          until they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them, 
          and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept 
          (them) with full submission 
[al-Nisaa’ 4:65] 
“Do 
          they then seek the judgement of (the days of) Ignorance? And who is 
          better in judgement than Allaah for a people who have firm Faith.” 
          
[al-Maa’idah 5:50] 
“O you who believe! Obey Allaah 
          and obey the Messenger (Muhammad), and those of you (Muslims) who are 
          in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer 
          it to Allaah and His Messenger, if you believe in Allaah and in the 
          Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination” 
          
[al-Nisaa’ 4:59] 
“And 
          in whatsoever you differ, the decision thereof is with Allaah (He is 
          the ruling Judge)” [al-Shooraa 
          42:10] 
 And there are many similar aayaat. 
 From these verses we know that it is not permissible 
          for the Muslim to refer for judgement to man-made laws, or to tribal 
          customs that go against sharee’ah. 
 My sincere advice in this matter to the rulers of 
          all Muslim states – because of the many conflicts that have arisen among 
          them and are still continuing – is that the only way that they should 
          resort to in order to resolve these conflicts among their states concerning 
          properties, rights, political boundaries, etc., is to refer to the laws 
          of Allaah. This may be done by forming a committee or sharee’ah court 
          made up of scholars of sharee’ah who are acceptable to all in terms 
          of their knowledge, understanding, fairness and piety, who will look 
          at solutions to the conflicts then will pass judgement in accordance 
          with what the sharee’ah of Islam dictates. They should realize that 
          what some of them have done, by referring to the International Court 
          of Justice and similar non-Islamic organizations comes under the heading 
          of referring to laws other than the laws of Allaah, and it is not permissible 
          to judge by those laws or to apply them to cases between Muslims. They 
          must avoid doing that; let them fear Allaah and pay heed to the punishment 
          with which He warns those who go against His laws. As Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning): 
“But 
          whosoever turns away from My Reminder (i.e. neither believes in this 
          Qur’ân nor acts on its teachings) verily, for him is a life of hardship, 
          and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of Resurrection. 
He will say: ‘O my Lord! Why 
          have you raised me up blind, while I had sight (before).’ 
(Allaah) 
          will say: ‘Like this: Our Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, 
          signs, revelations, etc.) came unto you, but you disregarded them (i.e. 
          you left them, did not think deeply in them, and you turned away from 
          them), and so this Day, you will be neglected (in the Hell-fire, 
          away from Allaah’s Mercy).’” 
[Ta-Ha 20:124-126] 
“And 
          so judge (you O Muhammad) among 
          them by what Allaah has revealed and follow not their vain desires, 
          but beware of them lest they turn you (O Muhammad) far away from some 
          of that which Allaah has sent down to you. And if they turn away, then 
          know that Allaah’s Will is to punish them for some sins of theirs. And 
          truly, most of men are Faasiqoon (rebellious and disobedient to Allaah). 
          
Do they then seek the judgement 
          of (the days of) Ignorance? And who is better in judgement than Allaah 
          for a people who have firm Faith” 
[al-Maa’idah 5:49-50] 
The aayaat which point to the same meaning are many, all of which 
          reinforce the fact that obedience to Allaah and His Messenger is the 
          means to happiness in this life and blessing in the Hereafter, and that 
          disobeying His Messenger and turning away from the Reminder of Allaah 
          and His rulings is the means to a life of hardship and misery in this 
          life and torment in the Hereafter. I ask Allaah to guide us all to the 
          truth, to make us steadfast, to put our affairs right and to help us 
          to do all that is good for our worldly and religious affairs. May He 
          cause us all to accept the judgement of Allaah and His Messenger, for 
          He is the Most Generous, Most Kind. 
May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and all his family 
          and companions.","From Majmoo’ Fataawaa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), p.5"

11277,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11277,Meaning of al-Baatin and al-Zaahir,Could you please explain to us the meaning of Allaah’s names al-Baatin (the Most Near or the Hidden) and al-Zaahir (the Most High or the Manifest)?,,,"Praise be to Allah.The meaning of these two names is explained in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “You are al-Zaahir, and there is nothing above You, and You are al-Baatin and there is nothing beneath You.” (Narrated by Muslim).
 Al-Zaahir is interpreted as referring to highness, for Allaah is High and Exalted above all things. Some scholars interpreted it as meaning being manifest: He is the One Who is manifest to people by means of their reason through the proof of His existence and the evidence for His Oneness. So He is manifest by the evidence which points to Him and His actions which lead to knowledge of Him. So He is manifest and is known by means of reason and evidence, and He is Hidden because He is not seen, unlike all the things that are visible in this world – glorified and exalted be He far above such a thing. 
Allaah is al-Zaahir by virtue of His Wisdom, power of creation, actions and all the blessings which He bestows. No one is to be seen in that regard except Him. Al-Baatin is the One Whose essential nature and attributes are veiled from men of understanding.
 It was reported that some scholars interpreted al-Baatin as meaning Close, so they said that al-Baatin is closer than anything by His Knowledge and Power, but He is above His Throne.
 Al-Baatin was also interpreted as meaning the one who knows the innermost matters (bawaatin al-umoor), just as He knows the outward appearance of all things. 
Al-Bukhaari said: Yahyaa – i.e., al-Farraa’ – said: “He is al-Zaahir over all things by His knowledge and He is al-Baatin over all things by His knowledge.” 
Some scholars interpreted it as meaning that He cannot be known through the physical faculties or senses, unlike the created things that can be known in this manner. 
And it was said that He is veiled from His creatures’ sight and imagination, so they cannot see Him or encompass Him with their minds. 
Although all of these meanings are correct, it is best to adhere to the Prophet’s interpretation, which is the best because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) knows Allaah better than anyone else in creation. Ibn Jareer said: “Al-Zaahir (is) above everything else, He is the Most High, above all things, and there is nothing higher than Him. And He is close (al-Baatin) to all things, and there is nothing closer to anything than Him.”
 Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned that whoever denies that Allaah is above all things rejects the implications of His name al-Zaahir. It is not correct to say that al-Zaahir refers only to highness of status, as gold is described as being higher (of a higher status) than silver, because the one which is described as being lower may be placed in a higher location. It is not correct to think of it only in terms of power and dominion, even though Allaah is higher in power and dominion, for He is high in every sense, in His Essence, His status and His dominion.
 His name al-Baatin does not imply being low, for being low is a shortcoming, and He is far above any such imperfection. He is the Most High and cannot be anything but High.
 The names al-Zaahir and al-Baatin are connected. Al-Zaahir is connected to the idea of highness, because the higher a thing is, the more manifest it is. The idea of being high implies being manifest, and vice versa. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is nothing above You” – he did not say “There is nothing more manifest than You”, because being manifest implies being high.
 (These names also indicate) that Allaah encompasses all things by His knowledge and greatness, and that all things are as nothing before His greatness. And He is al-Baatin which indicates that He knows what is secret and hidden, down to the smallest detail.","From Sharh Asmaa’ Allaah ta’aala al-Husna by Dr. Hissah al-Sagheer, p. 61"
11278,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11278,The meaning of Allah’s name al-Haseeb,"What is the meaning of Allah’s name al-Haseeb (the Reckoner, the Bringer to Account)?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Al-Haseeb is the One who is Sufficient. He is Sufficient for those who put their trust in Him, and He is Sufficient and does not need witnesses.
 “Certainly, Allah is Ever a Careful Account Taker of all things”
[al-Nisaa’ 4:86 – interpretation of the meaning]
It may also be interpreted as al-Hafeez (the Preserver), i.e., He keeps records of all actions, then He will requite them. Allah is the Bringer to Account of His slaves, i.e., He will bring them to account for their deeds and will requite them for them according to His Wisdom and knowledge of the  smallest and greatest of their actions. So they will be brought to account for good and evil, down the minutest detail.
 He is the One Whose blessings and gifts are known. He knows about fractions and measurements, such as people may come to know through calculations, but He knows them without calculating. For the one who is counting knows things step-by-step, and he knows the total after he has finished calculating, but the knowledge of Allah is not dependent upon procedures. 
He is the Sufficient, in both a general and a specific sense.
 In the general sense, He takes care of all His slaves with regard to the things that concern them, both spiritual and worldly, such as attaining benefits and warding off harm.
 In the specific sense, He takes care of His pious slaves who put their trust in Him in such a way as to reform their worldly and spiritual affairs. For example, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O Prophet (Muhammad)! Allah is Sufficient for you and for the believers who follow you” [al-Anfaal 8:64]
i.e., He is Sufficient for you and Sufficient for your followers. As much as a person follows the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), both outwardly and inwardly, and as much as he worships Allah, Allah will take care of him and give him support and victory. For only Allah can take care of His slaves, so He is the only One in Whom they should put their trust, Whom they should fear and worship, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Is not Allah Sufficient for His slave?” [al-Zumar 39:36]
 Allah is the Swiftest in bringing to account. When His slaves come before Him He will bring them to account and that will not present any difficulty to Him. He knows their numbers, their deeds, their lifespans and all their affairs. He has taken accounted them and He knows their amounts; He does not reckon it by counting on His fingers, but He knows it and nothing is hidden from Him. Not even the weight of an atom or a smaller or greater amount than that is hidden from Him, but it is written in a clear Record.
 Ibn al-Qayyim said:
“He is the Sufficient, He fulfils [His slaves’] needs and protects [them], and He takes care of His slaves at every moment.”","From Sharh Asmaa’ Allaahu ta’aala al-Husna, by Dr. Hissah al-Sagheer, p. 93"

As far as his comment “you are a fanatic” is concerned, fanaticism, laxity and moderation are all to be understood in reference to sharee’ah. Whatever is in accordance with sharee’ah is moderate; whatever exceeds that is extreme and whatever falls short of that is laxity.

Does this also apply to a person who has an offensive odour which is also haraam, such as smoking? Does that mean that the person who consumes these things is excused for staying away from congregational prayers and is not considered to be a sinner for staying away?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It was narrated that the Messenger

11290,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11290,How to deal with sihr (magic/witchcraft),What is the way to deal with sihr (magic/witchcraft)?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Whoever is affected by sihr should not treat it with sihr, because evil cannot be removed by evil, and kufr cannot be removed by kufr. Evil is removed by good. Hence when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about al-nushrah (treating sihr with sihr), he said: “This is the work of the Shaytan.” Nushrah means removing sihr from a person who has been affected by it by using more sihr. But if it is treated by means of the Quran and permissible medicines or good ruqyahs, there is nothing wrong with that, but treating it with sihr is not permitted, as previously stated, because sihr means worshipping the shayateen (devils). The saahir (magician, practitioner of witchcraft) does sihr or learns sihr only after worshipping and serving the shayateen, and drawing close to them by means of the things that they like. After that, they teach him the means of sihr. But, praise be to Allah, there is no reason why the person who has been affected by sihr should not be treated by means of reciting Quran and the prayers for refuge with Allah that are prescribed in sharee’ah, and permissible medicines, just as patients with all kinds of sicknesses are treated by doctors. The patient does not necessarily recover, because not every sick person does recover. A sick patient might be treated and then recover if his appointed time (of death) has not yet arrived, or he may not recover and may die from this sickness, even though he may be been seen by the most skilled physicians and knowledgeable doctors. When the appointed time of death comes, no medicine or treatment will be of any avail, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And Allah grants respite to none when his appointed time (death) comes” [al-Munaafiqoon 63:11] 
Medical treatment is of benefit when the appointed time has not yet come, and Allah decrees that His slave should be healed. The same applies in the case of one who has been affected by sihr; Allah may decree that he should recover, or He may not decree that, as a test and a trial, or for other reasons which are known to Allah. Among those reasons may be the fact that the one who is treating him does not have the right treatment for this problem. It was narrated in a saheeh report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “For every disease there is a medicine, and if that medicine is applied to the disease, he will recover by Allah’s Leave.” And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has not sent down any disease but He has also sent down the cure; the one who knows it knows it and the one who does not know it does not know it.” 
Among the treatments prescribed in sharee’ah is the treatment of sihr with recitation of the Quran. The greatest soorah in the Quran, which is al-Faatihah, should be recited over the person who has been affected by sihr. This should be repeated several times. If it is recited by a believing, righteous reader who knows that everything is subject to the will and decree of Allah, that Allah is in control of all things, that when He says to a thing ‘Be!’ it is, if the reciting is based on faith, taqwa and sincerity, and is repeated several times, then the sihr may be removed and the person may recover by Allah’s Leave. Some of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) passed by some Bedouins whose shaykh, i.e., their leader, had been bitten. They had done everything they could but he had not gotten better. They said to one of the Sahaabah, “Is there any raaqi (one who performs ruqyah) among you?” They said, “Yes.” So one of them recited Soorat al-Faatihah over him, and he immediately got up full of energy as if nothing had happened; Allah healed him of the ill-effects of that snakebite. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is nothing wrong with ruqyah so long as it does not involve shirk.” He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) performed ruqyah and had it performed for him. There is a lot of good in ruqyah, and a great deal of benefit. Al-Faatihah, Aayat al-Kursiy, “Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad”, al-Mi’wadhatayn and other aayahs may be recited over the person who has been affected by sihr, as well as good du’aa’s narrated in the ahaadeeth from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), such as the du’aa’ he said when he performed ruqyah for a sick person and said, “Allahumma Rabb al-naas, adhhib il-ba’s, washfi anta al-Shaafi laa shifaa’a illa shifaa’uka shifaa’an laa yughaadir saqaman (O Allah, Lord of mankind, remove the harm and heal him, for You are the Healer and there is no healing except Your healing, with a healing which does not leave any disease behind).” This may be repeated three times or more. And it was also narrated from him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that Jibreel (peace be upon him) performed ruqyah for him and said three times: “Bismillaah arqeeka min kulli shay’in yu’dheeka, wa min sharri kulli nafsin aw ‘aynin haasid Allah yashfeek, bismillaah arqeek (In the name of Allah I perform ruqyah for you, from every thing that is harming you, from the evil of every soul or envious eye may Allah heal you, in the name of Allah I perform ruqyah for you).” This is a great ruqyah which was narrated in a saheeh hadeeth from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It is prescribed to perform ruqyah for the one who has been bitten or stung, and the one who has been affected by sihr, and the one who is sick. There is nothing wrong with performing ruqyah for one who is sick or has been affected by sihr or bitten or stung, by reciting good du’aa’s, even if they were not transmitted from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so long as they do not contain anything that is haraam, because of the general meaning of the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “There is nothing wrong with ruqyah so long as it does not involve shirk.” 
Allah may heal the sick person and the person affected by sihr, and others, without any ruqyah and without any action on the part of other people, because He is Able to do all things, and He is Wise in all that He does. Allah says in His Holy Book:
“Verily, His Command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, ‘Be!’ and it is!”[Yaa-Seen 36:82]
To Him be praise and thanks for all that He wills and decrees, for He is wise in all that He does. 
The sick person may not be healed if his appointed time has come and it is decreed that he should die from this disease. Among the things that may be used in ruqyah are the verses which speak of sihr, which may be recited into water. These are the verses about sihr in Soorat al-A’raaf, where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And We revealed to Moosa (saying): ‘Throw your stick,’ and behold! It swallowed up straight away all the falsehood which they showed.
Thus truth was confirmed, and all that they did was made of no effect.
So they were defeated there and returned disgraced [al-A’raaf 7:117-119]
And in Soorat Yoonus (interpretation of the meaning):
“And Pharaoh said: ‘Bring me every well-versed sorcerer.’
And when the sorcerers came, Moosa said to them: ‘Cast down what you want to cast!’
Then when they had cast down, Moosa said: ‘What you have brought is sorcery, Allah will surely make it of no effect. Verily, Allah does not set right the work of Al-Mufsidoon.
And Allah will establish and make apparent the truth by His Words, however much the Mujrimoon may hate (it).’” [Yoonus 10:79-82]
And in Soorat Ta-Ha (interpretation of the meaning):
“They said: ‘O Moosa! Either you throw first or we be the first to throw?’
Moosa said: ‘Nay, throw you (first)!’ Then behold! their ropes and their sticks, by their magic, appeared to him as though they moved fast.
So Moosa conceived fear in himself.
We (Allah) said: ‘Fear not! Surely, you will have the upper hand.
And throw that which is in your right hand! It will swallow up that which they have made. That which they have made is only a magician’s trick, and the magician will never be successful, to whatever amount (of skill) he may attain.’” [Ta-Ha 20:65-69]
These aayahs are among the things by which Allah causes the ruqyah against sihr to be beneficial. If the qaari’ (reader) recites these verses into water, and also reads Soorat al-Faatiha, Aayat al-Kursiy, “Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad”, and al-Mi’wadhatayn into the water, then pours it over the person who he thinks has been affected by sihr or is being prevented by magic from having intercourse with his wife, then he will be healed by Allah’s Leave. If seven lotus leaves are ground up and added to the water as well, this is appropriate, as was mentioned by Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Hasan (may Allah have mercy on him) in Fath al-Majeed, quoting from some of the scholars in the chapter entitled Ma jaa’a fi’l-Nushrah. It is mustahabb to recite the three soorahs, namely Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad, Qul A’oodhu bi Rabb il Falaq and Qul A’oodhu bi Rabb il-Naas. The point is that these and similar treatments which are used to treat this problem of sihr, may also be used to treat the one who is prevented by magic from having intercourse with his wife. This has been tried a great deal and Allah caused it to yield results. A person may be treated with al-Faatihah alone and be healed, or with Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad and al-Mi’wadhatayn on their own, and be healed. It is very important that the person performing this treatment and the person who is being treated should both have sincere faith and trust in Allah; they should know that He is control of all things and that when He wills a thing it happens, and when He does not will a thing it does not happen. The matter is in His hand, whatever He wills happens and whatever He does not will does not happen. When both the reader and the one who is read over have faith and are sincere towards Allah, the sickness will disappear quickly by Allah’s Leave, and both physical and spiritual medicine will be beneficial.
We ask Allah to help us all to please Him, for He is All-Hearing and is ever Near.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), p. 70"
