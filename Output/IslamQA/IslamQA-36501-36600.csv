36512,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36512,The one who is delegated to distribute zakaah is not one of those who are employed to collect it,"If a rich man gives me the zakaah of his wealth to distribute it to the poor, am I one of those who are employed to collect it and can I take some of it?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Those who are employed 
    to collect the zakaah are those who are appointed by the Muslim authorities, 
    who collect it, store it and distribute it, and so on. 

    See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/142 

    But if a person is delegated by the owner of the wealth to 
    distribute his zakaah, he is acting on behalf of the owner of the wealth, 
    and is not one of those who are employed to collect it. 

    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in 
    al-Majmoo’, 6/165: 
Al-Shaafa’i and his 
    companions (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If the one who is 
    distributing the zakaah is its owner or his deputy, the share of the agent 
    employed to collect it is waived and he must give it to the seven other 
    categories (of people who are entitled to it). End quote. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was 
    asked: A rich man sent his zakaah to someone and said: “Distribute it as you 
    see fit.” Is this deputy one of those who are employed to collect it and is 
    he entitled to any of it?” 

    He replied: 
This deputy is not one of 
    those who are employed to collect it, and he is not entitled to any of it, 
    because he has been delegated only by a particular individual. This is the 
    reason – and Allaah knows best – why the Qur’aan says (interpretation of the 
    meaning):  

    “those employed to collect (the funds)”

    [al-Tawbah 9:60]
This refers to those who 
    are appointed to do this task. Therefore the one who is delegated to 
    distribute the zakaah on behalf of a particular individual is not regarded 
    as one of those who are employed to collect zakaah. And Allaah knows best. 
    End quote. 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 
    18/369. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: I 
    have some wealth on which zakaah is due, and I want to send some of it to 
    the poor in another country. I know a rich man in that country and I want to 
    send the money through him so that he can give it to the needy, but he will 
    not do that unless I pay him. Is it permissible to give him some of the 
    zakaah money in return for his doing that?  

    He replied: 
It is better for you to 
    distribute your zakaah among the poor in your own country, but if you send 
    it to another country where the poor are in greater need or because they are 
    your relatives and are poor, there is nothing wrong with that. If you 
    delegate someone to distribute the zakaah, there is nothing wrong with 
    giving him something in return that is not part of the zakaah, because what 
    you have to do is distribute it among the poor yourself or through your 
    trustworthy deputy who you have to pay from your own wealth, not from the 
    zakaah. End quote.

36513,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36513,Is Reciting the Quran at Graves Permissible?,Is it permissible to read the Quran at the grave?,Reciting the Quran at the grave is not prescribed in Islam because there is no report that says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did that.,,"Praise be to Allah. 
Reading the Quran at the grave is not prescribed in Islam because there is no report that says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did that. 
The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked: Is it permissible to read al-Fatihah or anything from the Quran for the deceased when visiting his grave, and does that benefit him? 
They replied: 
“It is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to visit graves, and he would recite du`a’s for the dead that he taught to his companions and they learned them from him. For example: “Al-salamu ‘alaykum ahl ad-diyar min al-mu’minin wa’l-Muslimin, wa inna in sha Allah bikum lahiqun, nas’al Allaha lana wa lakum al-‘afiyah (Peace be upon you, O people of the dwellings, believers and Muslims. If Allah wills we will join you. We ask Allah to grant us and you safety).” 
But there is no report that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited a surah of the Quran or any verses thereof for the dead , even though he visited them often. If that had been prescribed, he would have done it and would have taught it to his companions, seeking the reward and out of mercy towards his Ummah, and fulfilling the obligation to convey the message. For he was as Allah described him (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty. He (Muhammad) is anxious over you; for the believers (he is) full of pity, kind, and merciful.” [At-Tawbah 9:128]
The fact that he did not do that even though there were reasons why he could have done it indicates that it is not prescribed. His companions (may Allah be pleased with them) knew that and followed in his footsteps, and they limited themselves to learning lessons and making Du`a for the dead when they visited them. There is no report that they read the Quran for the dead . For them such reading was an innovation (Bid`ah), and it was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever introduces anything into this matter of ours [i.e., Islam] that is not part of it will have it rejected.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 9/38)

36514,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36514,Is it better for a woman to do a naafil Hajj even though she is exposed to crowding with men?,"You are well aware of the fact that when women go to Hajj they are faced with crowding and mixing with men during tawaaf and saa’i and at other holy sites. Is it better for women who have done the obligatory Hajj to repeat Hajj, or should they be content with the obligatory Hajj?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on 
    him) said:
 Undoubtedly repeating Hajj brings great 
    virtue for both men and woman, but in view of the great crowding in recent years, because means of transportation have become easier, and people 
    come from all over the world, and travel has become safer, and because men and women mix during tawaaf and in the places of worship, and because 
    many of them do not avoid causing fitnah – we think that not repeating Hajj is better for them, and safer for their religious commitment, and less 
    likely to cause harm to the society which may be tempted by some of them. Similarly men should avoid repeating Hajj frequently, so as to leave 
    more space for the pilgrims and to reduce the crowding. We hope that their reward for not doing it will be greater than the reward of Hajj, if 
    this is the intention.","Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn Baaz,. 16/361"

He should not speak the intention out loud, rather he should say Bismillaah and Allahu akbar when slaughtering it, because it was proven in al-Saheehayn that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) slaughtered two rams with his own hand, and he said Bismillaah and Allahu akbar.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7/130, no. 5554; Muslim, 3/1556, no. 1966; Ahmad, 3/115.

So his son put this famous stone there for him so that he could stand on it when the building grew tall… The footprints of al-Khaleel (Ibraaheem, peace be upon him) remained on the rock until the beginning of Islam. From al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah, 1/163 
Ibn Hajr said: What is meant by Maqaam Ibraaheem is the stone on which are the marks of his feet. 
Ibn Katheer said: 
The marks of his feet were clear on it and were well known; the Arabs were familiar with that during their jaahiliyyah and the Muslims also knew of that, as Anas ibn Maalik said: I saw the Maqaam on which were the marks of his toes and heels. 
But they disappeared because of people touching them with their hands. 
Ibn Jareer narrated that Qataadah said: “ ‘And take you (people) the Maqaam (place) of Ibraaheem (Abraham) [or the stone on which Ibraaheem (Abraham) stood while he was building the Ka‘bah] as a place of prayer (for some of your prayers, e.g. two Rak‘at after the Tawaaf of the Ka‘bah at Makkah)’ [al-Baqarah 2:125 – interpretation of the meaning]. This means that they were commanded to pray at that place; they were not commanded to touch it. This ummah went beyond what was prescribed for it, to an extent that no previous nation did. We have heard from those who saw the marks of his heels and toes on it, but this ummah kept touching them until they disappeared.” From Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 1/117 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
Undoubtedly Maqaam Ibraaheem is proven and that on which the glass enclosure is built is indeed Maqaam Ibraaheem. But the engraved marks that appear on it do not seem to be footprints, because what is well known from an historical point of view is that those footprints disappeared a long time ago. But these engraved marks were meant as a marker only, and we cannot be certain that these are the footprints of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him).",Islam Q&A
36522,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36522,Whoever does one of the things that are forbidden in ihraam out of forgetfulness or ignorance,"If the muhrim does one of the things that are forbidden in ihraam out of forgetfulness or because he is unaware that it is haraam, what is the ruling?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
If he does one of the things that are forbidden in ihraam out of forgetfulness or ignorance, 
    there is no blame on him, but he must correct himself as soon as he remembers or finds out, so it is essential to remind people and to teach those 
    who are ignorant. 
For example: if a man forgets and puts on regular clothes when he is in ihraam, he does not 
    have to do anything, but as soon as he remembers he has to take off these clothes. Similarly if he forgets and keeps his pants on, then he 
    remembers after he has formed the intention and started to recite the Talbiyah, he has to take off his pants immediately and he does not have to 
    do anything else. And if he was ignorant of the ruling, he does not have to anything, such as if he wore a t-shirt in which there was no 
    stitching, thinking that the muhrim can wear anything that has no stitching, he does not have to do anything. But once it is explained to him that 
    a t-shirt, even if it has no stitching, is a kind of clothing which he is forbidden to wear, then he has to take it off. 
The basic principle concerning that is that if a person does any of the things that are 
    forbidden in ihraam out of forgetfulness or ignorance, or because he is forced to do them, there is no blame on him, because Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error”
[al-Baqarah 2:286]
and Allaah has said, “I will do that.” 
And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And there is no sin on you concerning that in which you made a mistake, except in regard to 
    what your hearts deliberately intend. And Allaah is Ever Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Ahzaab 33:5]
And Allaah says concerning hunting in particular (interpretation of the meaning): 
“…and whosoever of you kills it intentionally …”
[al-Maa’idah 5:95]
It makes no difference whether the thing that is forbidden in ihraam has to do with dress, 
    perfume etc, or hunting game, or shaving the hair on one's head, etc. Some scholars differentiate between these things, but the correct view is 
    that there is no difference, because these are things that are forbidden but for which a person may be excused if he does them out of 
    forgetfulness or ignorance, or because he is forced to do them.","Fataawa Arkaan al-Islam, p. 536-537"

It was narrated from Ibn `Umar and Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “People should stop neglecting Jumu`ah prayers or else Allah will place a seal over their hearts, then they will be among the negligent.” (Narrated by Muslim, 865) 
Based on this, you should tell your boss that you are going to go to Jumu`ah prayer, and he should give you and other Muslims permission. You can tell him that you will make up the time by doing extra work. And pray to Allah to make it easy for you. 
“And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).” [At-Talaq 65:2]
Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about some workers whose bosses did not give them permission to attend Jumu`ah prayer on the grounds that they were guards on a farm. 
He replied: 
“If these workers are so far from the mosque that they would not be able to hear the Adhan without a loudspeaker, and they are outside the town, then they do not have to pray Jumu`ah. The workers may rest assured that there is no sin on them if they stay on the farm and pray Thuhr. But we advise their employer to give them permission (to attend Jumu`ah) because that is better for him and better for them; it may also soften their hearts towards him which may make them more sincere in their work, unlike if he puts pressure on them. Many workers ask to go to Jumu`ah prayer so that they can meet their friends and acquaintances, hence you see them going to Jumu`ah and talking in the marketplace until the Imam comes, then when the Imam comes they enter the mosque. 
The point of the above is that if they can hear the call to prayer, or they are inside the town, they should attend Jumu`ah; if they are outside the town and cannot hear the call to prayer, then they do not have to do anything.”
The Standing Committee was asked about a young man who works as a guard, and his employer does not allow him to pray in the mosque. He beats him if he prays in the mosque and threatens to send him back to his country.

“The five daily prayers should be offered in the mosque in congregation , so you have to perform them in congregation in the mosque. You have to be patient and seek reward in doing that, and Allah will grant you ease after hardship. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).
And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.”

But if your leaving work to pray Jumu`ah will adversely affect the factory, such as the risk of machines breaking down or fires breaking out etc., and there are other men in the factory with you, you can pray Jumu`ah in the factory, if the factory is inside the town, or it is outside and you can hear the Adhan without the aid of loudspeakers. 
If the factory is outside the town and you cannot hear the Adhan without loudspeakers, or you fear that leaving work at the time of prayer will cause some problems at work, then this is an excuse for you not to pray Jumu`ah. In that case you should pray Thuhr, in congregation is possible. 
The Standing Committee (8/188) was asked about some employees of the Telegraph and Telephone company whose work continues on Fridays at the time of the prayer; if they stop working then the wireless and telephone communications will cease. Is it permissible for them not to pray Jumu`ah? 
The Committee replied that Jumu`ah prayer is an individual obligation because of the evidence in the Quran and Sunnah and the consensus of the scholars. Then they said: 
But if there is a legitimate Shar`i excuse for someone who is obliged to pray Jumu`ah, such as if he is directly responsible for work that has to do with the security of the Ummah and guarding its interests, which means that he has to take care of that during the time of Jumu`ah prayer – such as men who work in the security forces, traffic police, those who work in wireless and telecommunications, etc., who have to be on call at the time of the last call for Jumu`ah prayer or when the Iqamah is given for a congregational prayer – they and others like them are excused for not attending Jumu`ah or prayers in congregation, because of the general meaning of the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.” [At-Taghabun 64:16]
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whatever I forbid you, avoid, and whatever I tell you to do, do as much of it as you can.”  
This excuse is not less than that of one who is excused from Jumu`ah and praying in congregation, as long as the excuse still stands, but that does not mean that he is excused from praying Thuhr, rather he must pray Thuhr on time, and if it is possible to pray in congregation he must do so, as with all of the five daily prayers. 
The Committee was also asked (8/191) about a doctor who is on call in the clinic at the time of Jumu`ah prayer to treat the sick or wounded who may need emergency treatment. Is it permissible for him not to pray Jumu`ah? 
They replied: 
“The doctor mentioned in the question is doing an important job that is of benefit to the Muslims; if he goes to Jumu`ah prayer that will result in great danger. So there is no sin on him if he does not go to Jumu`ah prayer, but he has to offer Thuhr prayer on time, and if it is possible for him to pray in congregation he must do so, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.” [At-Taghabun 64:16]
If there are other colleagues on call with him, they have to pray Thuhr in congregation. 
And they were asked (8/192) about a guard in a gas station that is about two kilometers outside the town, Is it permissible for him not to pray Jumu`ah, knowing that the station has previously been robbed and set ablaze, and his children and mahrams live there? 
They replied: 
“If the matter is as described, then it is permissible for the guard to pray Thuhr instead of Jumu`ah , so that he can guard what he mentioned, because of the general meaning of the shar’i evidence which indicates that it is allowed not to pray Jumu`ah in such cases.”
They were also asked (8/194) about a group of between 13 and 15 employees who work in a petrol refinery and pray Jumu`ah in their workplace because they cannot go out to pray Jumu`ah because of their work. 
They replied: 
“If the matter is as mentioned, you may pray Jumu`ah in your workplace, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.” [At-Taghabun 64:16]
In conclusion, if you find that the interests of the Muslims as a whole or of an individual will be affected – such as stealing of property, arson, destruction of property etc – as a result of attending Jumu`ah, it is permissible not to attend and to pray Thuhr instead. 
But if the reason for not attending is to make more profit or to increase productivity or to increase study time, or to keep this job and not lose it because this job has a higher salary, and other such worldly interests, then this is not a reason for which Shari`ah allows one to miss Jumu`ah . How can it be, when Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe (Muslims)! When the call is proclaimed for the prayer on Friday (Jumu`ah prayer), come to the remembrance of Allah [Jumu`ah religious talk (Khutbah) and prayer] and leave off business (and every other thing). That is better for you if you did but know!” [Al-Jumu`ah 62:9] 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever misses Jumu`ah three times out of negligence, Allah will place a seal over his heart.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 500; classed as authentic by Al-Albani) 
So beware of being negligent about it.

The matter is broad in scope but the best way is to eat one-third, give one-third as gifts and give one-third in charity. What one is permitted to eat may also be stored, even for a long time, so long as that will not result in any harm being caused by eating it, except in times of famine, when it is not permitted to store it for more than three days, because of the hadeeth of Salamah ibn al-Akwa’ (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever among you offers a sacrifice should not have anything of it left in his house after three days.” The following year, they said, “O Messenger of Allah, should we do what we did last year?” He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Eat some, give some to others and store some, for last year the people were having a hard time and I wanted you to help (the needy).” Agreed upon. 
With regard to the permission to eat and give away the meat of the udhiyah it makes no difference whether the sacrifice is voluntary or obligatory, or whether it is offered on behalf of a living person or a deceased one, or in fulfillment of a will, because the executor of the will takes the place of the person who made it, and the person who made the will would eat, give away and give in charity. And because this is the custom among people, and that which is done customarily is like that which is spoken.  
In the case of one who has been delegated to offer the sacrifice, if the person who appointed him has given him permission to eat of it and give some as gifts and in charity, or if that is indicated by analogy or by custom, then he may do that, otherwise he should give it to the person who appointed him, who is then in charge of the distribution of the meat.
 It is haraam to sell any part of the udhiyah, whether that is the meat or any other part, including the skin. And the butcher should not be given any part of it in return for his work or part of it, because that is like selling. 
But if a person gives the butcher some of it as a gift or as an act of charity, then he may dispose of it however he wishes, by selling it or otherwise, but he should not sell it to the one who gave it to him.",Islam Q&A

Examples of good deeds in Islam","Praise be to Allah.Significance of doing good deeds in Islam
If Allah helps him to do righteous deeds , the Muslim can earn a great deal of reward. 
There are many different kinds of good deeds that can be done by the rich and poor, old and young, male and female, depending on each person’s circumstances, ambition and energy, after the help of Allah.  
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Whoever works righteousness — whether male or female — while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter)”. [al-Nahl 16:97]
Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Hasten to do good deeds before there come tribulations like pieces of a dark night, when a man will be a believer in the morning and a kafir by evening, or he will be a believer in the evening and a kafir by morning, selling his religious commitment for worldly gain.” (Narrated by Muslim, 118)
Examples of good deeds in Islam
The kinds of good deeds that a person can do every day include the following: 
1.Praying in congregation in the mosque 
Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever goes to the mosque in the morning and evening , Allah will prepare for him an honourable place in Paradise every time he goes and comes.”  (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 631; Muslim, 669)
2.Attending funerals and offering the funeral prayer 
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever attends a funeral until he offers the (funeral) prayer will have one qirat (of reward) and whoever attends until the burial is done will have two qirats.” It was said: “What are the two qirats?” He said: “Like two great mountains.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1261; Muslim, 945) 
3.Saying “La ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu la sharika lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadir (There is no god but Allah Alone, with no partner or associate; His is the Dominion, to Him be all praise, and He is able to do all things)” one hundred times each day. 
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever says La ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu laa sharika lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadir one hundred times in a day, it will be as if he freed ten slaves, and one hundred hasanat (good deeds) will be recorded for him, and one hundred sayiat (bad deeds) will be erased from him, and it will be a protection for him against the Shaytan all that day until evening comes. No one can do anything better than that except one who does more.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3119; Muslim, 2691) 
4.Upholding the ties of kinship 
Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever would like his provision to be increased and his lifespan extended, let him uphold his ties of kinship.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5639; Muslim, 2557)
5.Observing voluntary fasts, visiting the sick and giving charity. 
Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Who among you is fasting today?” Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I am.” He said: “Who among you has attended a funeral today?” Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I have.” He said: “Who among you has fed a poor person today?’ Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I have.” He said: “Who among you has visited a sick person today?” Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I have.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “These (traits) are not combined in a person but he will enter Paradise.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1028) 
6.Saying Subhan Allah wa bi hamdih (Praise and glory be to Allah) one hundred times. 
Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever says Subhan Allah wa bi hamdih (Praise and glory be to Allah) one hundred times, morning and evening, his sins will be erased even if they are like the foam of the sea.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6042; Muslim, 2691) 
7.Tasbeeih, tahmid and takbir, and enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and praying Duha. 
Abu Dharr narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “For every bone of the son of Adam a charity must be given each day. Every tasbihah [saying Subhan Allah (Glory be to Allah)] is a charity, every tahmidah [saying al-hamdu Lillah (praise be to Allah)] is a charity, every tahlilah [saying La ilaha ill-Allah (There is no god but Allah)] is a charity, every takbirah [saying Allahu akbar [Allah is Most Great]) is a charity, enjoining what is good is a charity, forbidding what is evil is a charity, and two rak’ahs offered in the mid-morning (Duha) is sufficient.” (Narrated by Muslim, 720)
8.Reading Quran. 
‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever reads a letter of the Book of Allah will be credited with a good deed, and a good deed gets a tenfold reward. I do not say that Alif-Lam-Mim is a letter, rather alif is a letter, lam is a letter and mim is a letter.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2910; he said it is hasan sahih. Also classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi) 
And there are many other good deeds . The Muslim should seek the help of his Lord to do good deeds , and do his best to do them. He should persist in doing these good deeds even if they are little, for that is better than doing a lot of good deeds then stopping. 
‘Aishah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O people, you should do whatever good deeds you can, for Allah does not get tired (of giving reward) until you get tired. And the most beloved of good deeds to Allah is that in which a person persists, even if it is little. If the family of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) started to do something, they would persist in it.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 43; Muslim, 782)

That is done is public places. Also, he does not pray – is the money that he spends on them haraam?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If a man has issued the last of three talaaqs (divorces), or he has divorced her once or twice and her ‘iddah has ended, then she becomes a stranger (non-mahram) to him, and it is not permissible for her to be alone with him or to touch her or to look at her. 
The relationship of an ex-husband with his ex-wife is like his relationship with any other non-mahram woman. The fact that they have children does not justify his looking at her, being alone with her or travelling with her. He can go out with his children without her being there, or she can be present with one of her mahrams, without doing any of the haraam things that we have mentioned. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
A thrice-divorced woman is a stranger (non-mahram) to the man like any other non-mahram woman, so the man does not have the right to be alone with her, just as he does not have the right to be alone with any non-mahram woman. And he cannot see of her what he cannot see of any non-mahram woman, and there are no special rulings concerning the relationship between them (other than the rulings governing all interactions between non-mahrams). 
Al-Fataawa al-Kubra, 3/349. 
With regard to accepting what the divorced husband spends on his children, there is no reason not to do so, even if he does not pray. She should remind her children of the importance of advising their father to pray, and may Allaah guide him through this advice. 
If the mother fears that her children may be adversely affected by their kaafir father or that he may lead them to do something that Allaah has forbidden, it is not permissible for her to allow them to go out with him, because their going out with him is causing them harm.

Why should you avoid removing hair or cutting nails if you are offering udhiyah?


Should your family avoid removing hair or cutting nails if you are offer udhiyah?","Praise be to Allah.Can you cut hair or nails if you are offering sacrifice?
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“If anyone wants to offer a sacrifice , and the month of Dhul Hijjah has begun, either because the new moon has been sighted or because thirty days of Dhul Qi`dah have passed, then it is haram for him to remove anything of his hair or nails or skin until he has slaughtered the sacrifice.  Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When you see the new moon of Dhul Hijjah – according to another version, When the ten days (of Dhul Hijjah) begin – and any one of you wants to offer a sacrifice, let him refrain (from cutting) his hair and nails.” (Narrated by Ahmad and Muslim)
According to another version, “Let him not remove anything from his hair and nails until he has offered the sacrifice.” And according to yet another version, “He should not touch his hair or skin.” 
If he forms the intention to offer the sacrifice during the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah , then he should refrain from that from the moment he forms that intention, and there is no sin on him for anything he may have done before forming the intention.  
Why should you avoid removing hair or cutting nails if you are offering udhiyah?
The reason for this prohibition is that when the person who wants to offer the sacrifice joins the pilgrims in some of the rituals of Hajj – namely drawing closer to Allah by slaughtering the sacrifice – he also joins him in some of the features of ihram, namely refraining from cutting his hair etc.
Should your family avoid removing hair or cutting nails if you are offer udhiyah?
This ruling applies only to the one who is going to slaughter the sacrifice. It does not apply to the one on whose behalf a sacrifice is offered . The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “If any one of you wants to offer a sacrifice.” He did not say, “… is going to have a sacrifice offered on his behalf.” And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to offer the sacrifice on behalf of the members of his household, and it is not narrated that he told them to refrain from that (cutting their hair and nails etc). 
Based on this, it is permissible for the family of the person who is going to offer the sacrifice to remove things from their hair, nails and skin during the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah. 
What to do if you remove hair or cut nails in Dhul-Hijjah
If the person who wants to offer the sacrifice does remove anything from his hair, nails or skin then he has to repent to Allah and not do it again, but he does not have to offer any expiation , and that does not prevent him from offering the sacrifice as some of the common people think. 
If he does any of those things out of forgetfulness or ignorance, or some hair falls unintentionally, then there is no sin on him. If he needs to remove it, then he may do so, and there is no blame on him, such as if a nail breaks and it annoys him, so he cuts it, or if a hair gets in his eye and he removes it, or he needs to cut his hair in order to treat a wound and the like.”

36573,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36573,Someone appointed him to buy something for him; is it permissible for him to increase the price without that person’s knowledge?,"Is it permissible to take a sum of money in return for doing a service for someone? For example, someone asked me to buy something for him, because I have knowledge of such things. Then one of my friends agreed to give me that thing for a cheap price, because of my standing with him. Can I increase the price a little for the one who asked me to buy it and keep the difference for myself without him knowing?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If someone has appointed you to buy something for him, you do 
    not have the right to increase its price, because you have been entrusted 
    with that, and the basic principle is that any loss or gain goes back to the 
    person who appointed you, unless he allows you to take some of it. 

    It is permissible for you to ask him for a fee in return for 
    acting on his behalf, or to tell him that you will buy the item and then 
    sell it to him. If the seller gives it to you for free, then according to 
    the scholars it belongs to the one who appointed the other to buy it, not to 
    the one who was appointed (the agent). 

    It says in Mataalib Uli’l-Nuha (3/132): “If a seller 
    gives someone who is acting as an agent a gift, after he bought something 
    from him, it is like decreasing the price, so it is part of the transaction 
    and so it belongs to the one who appointed him.” This means that any 
    reduction in price is for the benefit of the one who appointed the person to 
    buy the item; the same applies to any gift that is given by the seller to 
    the agent. 

    The Standing Committee was asked: 

    Someone else appointed me to buy something for him, and its 
    price was five pounds, for example, but the man gave it to him for four and 
    a half pounds. Does he (the agent) have the right to take the remaining 
    money, which is half a pound (fifty pence), or not? 

    The Committee replied: 
This is regarded as 
    appointing someone else to do something on one's behalf, and it is not 
    permissible for the person appointed as an agent to take anything from the 
    wealth of the one who appointed him, except with his permission, because of 
    the general meaning of the evidence which states that the wealth of a Muslim 
    man is haraam to others unless he gives it willingly.

The Muslim must be 
    honest in his dealings. It is not permissible for him to lie and to take 
    people’s wealth unlawfully. That includes the case of a man who appoints his 
    brother to buy something for him; it is not permissible for him (the agent) 
    to take anything more than the price that he paid for the goods. Similarly 
    it is not permissible for the one who sold it to him to write a price other 
    than the real price on the bill in order to deceive the one who appointed 
    him, so that he will pay more than the real price and the agent will pocket 
    the difference, because this is a kind of coopering in sin and iniquity, and

I came to Saudi and I have done the obligation of Hajj three times. The last time I intended that it should be on behalf of my deceased father, but I heard of a ruling that a person who does not pray is regarded in sharee’ah as a kaafir, and I was very upset when I thought about my father’s situation. My question is: is this Hajj permissible, and will it expiate for his shortcoming with regard to prayer?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This question was put to Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) who said: 
This questioner mentions in her question that 
    she had done the obligation of Hajj three times. The correct view is that Hajj is obligatory only once in a lifetime, because it was proven that 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Hajj is once in a lifetime, and any more than that is voluntary.” So your 
    saying that you have done this obligation three times is a mistake. 
With regard to your having done Hajj on 
    behalf of your father who did not pray, the kuffaar do not benefit from righteous deeds, and it is not permissible to seek forgiveness for them, 
    because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is not (proper) for the Prophet and 
    those who believe to ask Allaah’s forgiveness for the Mushrikoon, even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are the 
    dwellers of the Fire (because they died in a state of disbelief)”
[al-Tawbah 9:113]
But since your father did pray sometimes, or there is some doubt as to whether he can be 
    regarded as a kaafir, there is nothing wrong with your doing Hajj on his behalf and saying, “O Allaah, give the reward for this to my father if he 
    was a believer.” Connect that to the condition of your father being a believer. There is nothing wrong with that, because making conditions is 
    permissible with regard to matters of worship and du’aa’. 
With regard to acts of worship, the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Dabaa’ah bint al-Zubayr (may Allaah be pleased with her), when she wanted to do Hajj but 
    she was sick, “Do Hajj and make a condition, because your condition is valid with your Lord.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5089; Muslim, 1207. 
With regard to du’aa’: Allaah says in the 
    verse on li’aan (interpretation of the meaning):

    invoking of the Curse of Allaah on him if he be of those who tell a lie (against her)”

 Should I go against my intention and proceed on the basis of what is written in the records or not?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The scholars differed concerning the ruling on one who 
    divorces his wife by saying “I divorce you thrice”. The majority of scholars 
    are of the view that this means that divorce has taken place three times; 
    others are of the view that divorce takes place only once. 

    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    was asked: 

    A man divorced his wife by saying “I divorce you thrice”; 
    what is the ruling on that?

     He replied: 

    If a man divorces his wife three times with one word, such as 
    saying, “You are thrice divorced”, the majority of scholars are of the view 
    that the woman is indeed thrice divorced and becomes forbidden for her 
    husband until she has been married to another man in a serious marriage in 
    which the new husband has intercourse with her and they only separate as a 
    result of death or divorce, not a tahleel marriage (i.e., a marriage of 
    convenience aimed at making it permissible for her to remarry her former 
    husband). 

    They quoted as evidence for that the fact that ‘Umar ibn 
    al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) counted such a divorce as being 
    three and judged among people accordingly. 

    Other scholars were of the view that this is to be regarded 
    as a single divorce, and the husband may take her back so long as the ‘iddah 
    has not yet ended. If the ‘iddah has ended then she may marry him with a new 
    marriage contract. They quoted as evidence for that the report narrated in
    Saheeh Muslim from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) who 
    said:  “At the time of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him), the time of Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) 
    and the first two years of the caliphate of ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him), a threefold divorce was counted as one. ‘Umar said: “People are 
    being hasty with regard to a matter in which they should not rush. Let us 
    count it as three and judge between people accordingly .” According to 
    another report narrated by Muslim: Abu’l-Sahba’ said to Ibn ‘Abbaas (may 
    Allaah be pleased with them): “Was not three counted as one at the time of 
    the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and 
    the time of Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) and the first three 
    years of the time of  ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him)?” He said: 
    “Yes,” 

    They also quote as evidence the report narrated by Imam Ahmad 
    in al-Musnad with a jayyid isnaad from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him), that Abu Rakaanah divorced his wife by saying “I divorce 
    you thrice”, then he regretted it, so the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) returned her to him with one word and said, “This is 
    only one (divorce).” This hadeeth and the one before it are to be understood 
    as referring to divorcing by saying “I divorce you thrice”, in order to 
    reconcile these two hadeeths and the verse in which Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “The divorce is twice”

    [al-Baqarah 2:229] 

    “And if he has divorced her (the third time), then she is 
    not lawful unto him thereafter until she has married another husband. Then, 
    if the other husband divorces her, it is no sin on both of them that they 
    reunite, provided they feel that they can keep the limits ordained by 
    Allaah. These are the limits of Allaah, which He makes plain for the people 
    who have knowledge”

    [al-Baqarah 2:230]
This was the view of Ibn 
    ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) according to a saheeh report 
    narrated from him; according to the other report narrated from him he shared 
    the view of the majority. The view that they should be regarded as one 
    divorce was narrated from ‘Ali, ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Awf and al-Zubayr ibn 
    al-‘Awwaam (may Allaah be pleased with them). 

    This was also the view of a number of the Taabi’een, Muhammad 
    ibn Ishaaq the author of al-Seerah, and a number of the earlier and 
    later scholars. It was also the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn 
    Taymiyah and his student Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on them). This 
    is also my view, because that is following all of the texts, and because it 
    is also more merciful and kind to the Muslims. 

    Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/281, 282. 
It seems that the qaadi 
    was also of this view, which is that the threefold divorce counts as one 
    divorce. Based on this there is nothing wrong with taking her back. 

    But after the ‘iddah is over you cannot take her back, rather 
    you have to make a new marriage contract with her. 
With regard to taking her 
    back after the ‘iddah is over – i.e., after three menstrual cycles – this is 
    not valid, because once a woman’s ‘iddah is completed she becomes a 
    “stranger” for her husband and she is not permissible for him except with a 
    new marriage contract.

Her family came to her on their way to Makkah and took her with them without the husband’s knowledge or approval. Is her Hajj valid?",It is not permissible for a Muslim woman to go to Hajj without her husband’s permission.,"Can a woman go out without her husband’s permission?


Can a woman go to Hajj without her husband’s permission?","Praise be to Allah.Can a woman go out without her husband’s permission?
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Before replying, I would like to point out that it is not permissible for a woman to go out without her husband’s permission , even if that is in the same city, so how can she go for Hajj without his permission? 
Can a woman go to Hajj without her husband’s permission?
It is not permissible for a wife to go to Hajj without her husband’s permission . The husband who promised to take his wife for Hajj has to fulfil his promise and take her for Hajj, especially since this promise is stated as a condition in the marriage contract. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The most deserving of conditions to be fulfilled are those by means of which intimate relations become permissible for you.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2729; Muslim, 1418) 
If this promise was made after the marriage contract, the scholars differed as to whether it should be fulfilled. The correct view is that it must be fulfilled so long as that will not cause harm to the one who made the promise, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) described breaking promises as one of the attributes of the hypocrites, as a warning against breaking promises.

36596,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36596,Can You Offer Udhiyah on behalf of the Dead?,Can I offer udhiyah (sacrifice) on behalf of my deceased parents?,You can offer udhiyah on behalf of the dead: 1- if the udhiyah is offered on their behalf as well as on behalf of the living; 2- if the udhiyah is offered in fulfillment of their last wishes; and 3- . if the udhiyah is offered voluntarily and independently of the living.,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The basic principle concerning the udhiyah is that it is prescribed for the living, as the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his Companions used to offer the sacrifice on behalf of themselves and their families . With regard to what some of the common folk think, that the sacrifice may be offered on behalf of the dead, there is no basis for that. 
Udhiyah on behalf of the dead may be of three types: 

When it is offered on their behalf as well as on behalf of the living, such as when a man offers a sacrifice on behalf of himself and the members of his family, and intends thereby both those who are alive and those who are dead . This is permissible, and the basis of that is the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) offered the sacrifice on behalf of himself and the members of his family, some of whom had previously died. 
Offering the sacrifice on behalf of the dead in fulfillment of their last wishes (wasiyyah). This is obligatory except in the case of one who is unable to do it. The basis for this is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Then whoever changes the bequest after hearing it, the sin shall be on those who make the change. Truly, Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.” [al-Baqarah 2:181]

Offering the sacrifice on behalf of the dead voluntarily and independently of the living – such as offering a separate sacrifice on behalf of one's father or mother. This is permissible. The Hanbali jurists have stated that the reward for that will reach the deceased and benefit him, by analogy with giving charity on behalf of the dead. 

But we do not think that singling out the dead for offering a sacrifice on their behalf is part of the Sunnah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not offer a sacrifice specifically on behalf of any of his deceased loved ones. He did not offer a sacrifice on behalf of his paternal uncle Hamzah even though he was one of his dearest relatives, or on behalf of his children who died during his lifetime, who were three married daughters and three sons who died in infancy, or on behalf of his wife Khadijah who was one of his most beloved wives. And it is not narrated that any of his Companions offered a sacrifice on behalf of any of their deceased loved ones. 
We also think that what some people do, offering a sacrifice on behalf of a deceased loved one in the first year after his or her death, which they call Udhiyat al-Hufrah (the sacrifice of the grave), and they think that no one else can share the reward of it, is wrong – as is offering a voluntary sacrifice on behalf of their deceased loved ones or in accordance with the will, and not offering a sacrifice on behalf of oneself and one’s family, which some people do. If they knew that when a man offers a sacrifice paid for with his own money on behalf of himself and his family, that includes all the members of his family, both living and dead, then they would not do this.

36599,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36599,He treated the financial director and he gave him some money,I work as a doctor in one of the hospitals and I treated a patient who is in charge of financial affairs. He gave me some money without me doing any work. Am I entitled to this money? Is it permissible for me to donate it to a charitable cause? Please note that I cannot return it.,,,"Praise be to Allah.If this 
    money belongs to the state, then it is essential to know under what category 
    a person could obtain it, such as if it comes under the heading of helping 
    the needy, rewarding higly-skilled persons, and so on. If you fit the 
    description, then it is permissible for you to take the money, otherwise you 
    should give it to those who fit the description. If you cannot do that, then 
    spend it as needed for your work, and do not take any of it for yourself. 
This 
    director should fulfil the trust with which he has been charged, and not 
    give this money to anyone except those who are entitled to it. 
If you can 
    advise him concerning that, then this is what you must do, because the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Help your 
    brother whether he is a wrongdoer or is wronged.” A man said: “O Messenger 
    of Allaah, I can help him if he is wronged but what if he is the wrongdoer, 
    how can I help him?” He said: “Stop him or prevent him from doing wrong. 
    That is how you help him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6952. 
If this 
    director is giving you this from his own money, then do not accept anything 
    from him, because that  comes under the heading of giving gifts to workers 
    that is forbidden in sharee’ah, because of the report narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 2597 and Muslim (1832) from Abu Humayd al-Saa’idi (may Allaah 
    be pleased with him), who said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) appointed a man from al-Azd to be in charge of 
    collecting the zakaah, and when he came, he said: “This is for you and this 
    was given to me as a gift.” He (the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him)) said: “Why doesn’t he sit in the house of his father or 
    the house of his mother and see whether he is given anything or not? By the 
    One in Whose hand is my soul, none of you takes anything from it but he will 
    come carrying it on his neck on the Day of Resurrection, even if it is a 
    camel that is groaning or a cow that is mooing or a sheep that is bleating.” 
    Then he raised his hand until we could see the whiteness of his armpit and 
    said: “O Allaah, have I conveyed (the message)? O Allaah, have I conveyed 
    (the message)?” three times. 
According to 
    a version narrated by Muslim: Then he addressed us and praised and glorified 
    Allaah, then he said: “I appointed a man from among you to do this task 
    which Allaah has enjoined upon me, and he comes and says, ‘This is your 
    wealth and this is a gift that was given to me.’ Why doesn’t he sit in the 
    house of his father and mother so that gifts will be brought to him if he is telling the truth.”
