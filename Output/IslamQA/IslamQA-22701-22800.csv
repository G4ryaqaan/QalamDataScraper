22704,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22704,Being Successful in Life,How to can one obtain success and prosperity in this world and the hereafterHereafter.What kind of success or prosperity that does iIslam want the ummah iIslamto gain in this world.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Peace of mind, contentment, happiness and freedom from worries and anxiety… these are what everyone wants, and these are the ways in which people can have a good life and find complete happiness and joy. There are religious means of achieving this, and natural and practical means, but no one can combine all of them except the believers; although other people may achieve some of them, they will miss out on others. 
Here follows a summary of the means of achieving this aim for which everyone is striving. In some cases, those who achieve many of them will live a joyful life and a good life; in other cases, those who fail to achieve all of them will live a life of misery and hardship. And there are others which are in between, according to the means they are able to attain. These means include the following: 
1 – Faith and righteous deeds:
This is the greatest and most fundamental of means. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Whoever works righteousness — whether male or female — while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter).” [al-Nahl 16:97]
Allah tells us and promises us that whoever combines faith with righteous deeds will have a good life and a good reward in this world and in the Hereafter. 
The reason for this is clear: those who believe in Allah – with sincere faith that motivates them to do righteous deeds that change hearts and attitudes and guides them to the straight path in this world and the Hereafter – follow principles and guidelines by means of which they deal with everything that happens to them, be it the causes of happiness and excitement or the causes of anxiety, worry and grief. 
They deal with the things that they like by accepting them and giving thanks for them, and using them in good ways. When they deal with them in this manner, it creates in them a sense of excitement and the hope that it will continue and that they will be rewarded for their gratitude, which is more important than the good things that happen to them. And they deal with bad things, worries and distress by resisting those that they can resist, alleviating those that they can alleviate, and bearing with goodly patience those that they cannot avoid. Thus as a result of the bad things they gain a lot of benefits, experience, strength, patience and hope of reward, which are more important and which diminish the hardships they have undergone and replace them with happiness and hope for the bounty and reward of Allah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) expressed this in a saheeh hadeeth (authentic report) in which he said: “How wonderful is the situation of the believer, for all his affairs are good. If something good happens to him, he gives thanks for it and that is good for him; if something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience, and that is good for him. This does not apply to anyone but the believer.” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 2999). 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us that the believer is always gaining and the reward for his deeds is always multiplying, no matter what happens to him, good or bad. 
2 – Being kind to people in word and deed, and all kinds of doing good. This is one of the means of removing worry, distress and anxiety. By this means Allah wards off worries and distress from the righteous and immoral alike, but the believer has the greater share of this, and is distinguished by the fact that his kindness to others stems from sincerity and the hope of reward, so Allah makes it easy for him to be kind to others because of the hope that this will bring good things and ward off bad things, by means of his sincerity and hope of reward. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“There is no good in most of their secret talks save (in) him who orders Sadaqah (charity in Allah’s Cause), or Ma‘roof (Islamic Monotheism and all the good and righteous deeds which Allah has ordained), or conciliation between mankind; and he who does this, seeking the good Pleasure of Allah, We shall give him a great reward.”[al-Nisa 4:114]
Part of this great reward is relief from worry, distress, troubles, etc. 
3 – Another of the means of warding off anxiety that stems from nervous tension and being preoccupied with disturbing thoughts is to occupy oneself with good deeds or seeking beneficial knowledge. This will distract one from dwelling on the matters that are causing anxiety. In this way a person may forget about the things that are making him worried and distressed, and he may become happy and more energetic. This is another means that believers and others have in common, but the believer is distinguished by his faith, sincerity and hope of reward when he occupies himself with the knowledge that he is learning or teaching, or with the good deeds that he is doing. 
The work with which he occupies himself should be something that he likes and enjoys, for that is more likely to produce the desired results. And Allah knows best. 
4 – Another thing that may ward off worry and anxiety is focusing all one’s thoughts on the present day, and not worrying about the future or grieving about the past. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sought refuge with Allah from worry and regret, from regret for things in the past which cannot be put right or changed, and worry which may come because of fear for the future. So one should focus only on the present day, and focus one's efforts on getting things right today. If a person is focused on the present, he will do things properly and forget about worry and regret.
When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said a du’a (supplication) or taught a du’a to his ummah (followers), as well as urging them to seek the help of Allah and hope for His bounty, he was also urging them to strive to attain the thing they were praying for through their own efforts and to forget about the thing which they were praying would be warded off from them because du’a (supplication) must be accompanied by action. So a person must strive to attain that which will benefit him in worldly and spiritual terms, and ask his Lord to make his efforts successful, and he should seek His help in this, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Strive for that which will benefit you and seek the help of Allah, and do not be helpless. If anything (bad) happens to you, do not say, ‘If only I had done such-and-such, then such-and-such would have happened.’ Rather you should say, ‘Qaddara Allah wa ma sha a fa’ala (Allah decrees, and what He wills He does),’ for (the words) ‘If only’ open the door to the Shaytan.” (Narrated by Muslim). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) connected the matter of striving to achieve good things with the matter of seeking the help of Allah and not giving in to feelings of helplessness which are a harmful kind of laziness, and with the matter of accepting things in the past which are over and done with, and acknowledging that the will and decree of Allah will inevitably come to pass. He described matters as being of two types: 
1 – Matters which a person may strive to achieve or to achieve whatever he can of them, or to ward them off or alleviate them. In such cases a person must strive and make the effort, and also seek the help of Allah. 
2 – Matters where such is not possible, so he must have peace of mind, accept them and submit to Allah’s will. 
Undoubtedly paying attention to this principle will bring happiness and relieve worry and distress. 
5 – One of the greatest means of feeling content and relaxed and of acquiring peace of mind is to remember Allah a great deal (dhikr). That has a great effect in bringing contentment and peace of mind, and relieving worry and distress. Allah says: 
“Verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.” [al-Ra’d 13:28]
Remembering Allah (dhikr) has a great effect in achieving this aim because it has a special influence and because of the hope that it brings of reward. 
6 – Another of the means of bringing happiness and relieving worry and distress is striving to eliminate the things that cause worry and to achieve the things that bring happiness. That may be done by forgetting about bad things in the past which cannot be changed, and realizing that dwelling on them is a waste of time. So a person must strive to stop himself from thinking of them, and also strive to stop himself from feeling anxious about the future and the things that he may imagine of poverty, fear and other bad things that he thinks may happen to him in the future. He should realize that the future is something that is unknown, he cannot know what good or bad things are going to happen to him. That is in the hand of the Almighty, the Most Wise, and all that His slaves can do is to strive to attain the good things and to ward off the bad things. A person should realize that if he diverts his thoughts from worrying about his future and puts his trust in his Lord to take care of his situation, and puts his mind at rest concerning this, if he does this, then his heart will be at peace and his situation will improve and he will be relieved of worry and anxiety. 
One of the most effective ways of dealing with worries about the future is to recite this du’a which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite: 
“Allahumma aslih li deeni alladhi huwa ‘ismatu amri, wa aslih li dunyaya allati fiha ma’ashi, wa aslih li akhirati allati ilayha ma’adi, waj’al al-hayata ziyadatan li fi kulli khayr, wa’l-mawta rahatan li min kulli sharr (O Allah, correct my religious commitment which is the foundation of my life, and correct my worldly affairs in which is my livelihood, and grant me good in the Hereafter to which is my return. Make my life a means of accumulating good, and make death a respite for me from all evil).” (Narrated by Muslim, 2720). 
And he said, “Allahumma rahmataka arju fa la takilni ila nafsi tarfata ‘aynin wa aslih li shani kullahu, la ilaha illa anta (O Allah, for Your mercy I hope, so do not abandon me to myself even for a moment. And correct all my affairs. There is no god but You).” (Narrated by Abu Dawood with a saheeh isnad [chain of transmitters], no. 5090; classed as hasan/good by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Kalim al-Tayyib, p.49).  
If a person utters these du’as, which ask that his spiritual and worldly affairs may be set right or corrected, with proper presence of mind and sincerity of intention, whilst striving to achieve this, Allah will grant him what he has prayed for, hoped for and striven for, and He will turn his worry into joy and happiness. 
7 – If a person experiences anxiety and distress because of a disaster, then one of the most effective means of relieving himself of that is to think of the worst scenario to which that may lead, and try to accept that. When he has done this, then he should try to alleviate it as much as possible. By means of this acceptance and these efforts, he will relieve himself of his worries and distress, and instead of worrying he will strive to bring about good things and to deal with whatever he can of the bad things. If he is faced with things that cause fear or the possibility of sickness or poverty, then he should deal with this by striving to make himself accept it, or something even worse, with contentment, because by making himself accept the worst-case scenario, he lessens the impact of the thing and makes it seem less terrible, especially if he occupies himself with efforts to ward it off as much as he can. Thus as well as striving to achieve something good which will distract him from his worries about calamity, he will also renew his strength to resist bad things, and put his trust and reliance in Allah. Undoubtedly these matters are of great benefit in attaining happiness and peace of mind, as well as bringing the hope of reward in this world and in the Hereafter. This is something which is well known from the experience of many who have tried it. 
8 – Steadfastness of heart and not being disturbed about the imaginary things that bad thoughts may bring to mind. For when a person gives in to his imagination and lets his mind be disturbed by these thoughts, such as fear of disease and the like, or anger and confusion stirred up by some grievous matter, or the expectation of bad things and the loss of good things, it will fill him with worries, distress, mental and physical illness and nervous breakdowns, which will have a bad effect on him and which causes a great deal of harm, as many people have seen. But when a person depends on Allah and puts his trust in Him, and does not give in to his imagination or let bad thoughts overwhelm him, and he relies on Allah and has hope of His bounty, this wards off his worries and distress, and relieves him of a great deal of mental and physical sickness. It gives indescribable strength, comfort and happiness to the heart. How many hospitals are filled with the mentally sick victims of illusions and harmful imagination; how often have these things had an effect upon the hearts of many strong people, let alone the weak ones; how often have they led to foolishness and insanity. 
It should be noted that your life will follow your train of thought. If your thoughts are of things that will bring you benefit in your spiritual or worldly affairs, then your life will be good and happy. Otherwise it will be the opposite. 
The person who is safe from all of this is the one who is protected by Allah and helped by Him to strive to achieve that which will benefit and strengthen the heart and ward off anxiety. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him.” [al-Talaq 65:3]
i.e., He will be sufficient for all that is worrying him in his spiritual and worldly affairs. The one who puts his trust in Allah will have strength in his heart and will not be affected by anything he imagines or be disturbed by events, because he knows that these are the result of vulnerable human nature and of weakness and fear that have no basis. He also knows that Allah has guaranteed complete sufficiency to those who put their trust in Him. So he trusts in Allah and finds peace of mind in His promise, and thus his worry and anxiety are dispelled; hardship is turned to ease, sadness is turned to joy, fear is turned to peace. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound, and to bless us with strength and steadfastness of heart, and complete trust, for Allah has guaranteed all good things to those who put their trust in Him, and has guaranteed to ward off all bad and harmful things from them. 
If bad things happen or there is the fear of such, then you should count the many blessings that you are still enjoying, both spiritual and worldly, and compare them with the bad things that have happened, for when you compare them you will see the many blessings that you are enjoying, and this will make the bad things appear less serious. 
See al-Wasail al-Mufeedah li’l-Hayat al-Sa’eedah by Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Sa’di 
Ibn al-Qayyim summed fifteen ways through which Allah may dispel worries and regret. These are as follows: 
1-     Tawheed al-Ruboobiyyah (belief in the Oneness of Divine Lordship)
2-     Tawheed al-Uloohiyyah (belief in the Oneness of the Divine nature)
3-     Tawheed of knowledge and belief (i.e., Tawheed al-Asma’ wa’l_Sifaat, belief in the Oneness of the Divine names and attributes)
4-     Thinking of Allah as being above doing any injustice to His slaves, and above punishing anyone for no cause on the part of the slave that would require such punishment.
5-     The person’s acknowledging that he is the one who has done wrong.
6-     Beseeching Allah by means of the things that are most beloved to Him, which are His names and attributes. Two of His names that encompass the meanings of all other names and attributes are al-Hayy (the Ever-Living) and al-Qayyoom (the Eternal).
7-     Seeking the help of Allah Alone.
8-     Affirming one's hope in Him.
9-     Truly putting one’s trust in Him and leaving matters to Him, acknowledging that one's forelock is in His hand and that He does as He wills, that His will is forever executed and that He is just in all that He decrees.
10- Letting one's heart wander in the garden of the Quran, seeking consolation in it from every calamity, seeking healing in it from all diseases of the heart, so that it will bring comfort to his grief and healing for his worries and distress.
11- Seeking forgiveness.
12- Repentance.
13- Jihad.
14-Salah (prayer).
15-Declaring that he has no power and no strength, and leaving matters to the One in Whose hand they are.
We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound from worries and to relieve us of distress and anxiety, for He is the All-Hearing, Ever-Responsive, and He is the Ever-Living, Eternal.

22705,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22705,When he wakes up and finds some wetness on his clothes and doesn’t know what it is,"I have an awkward question. What do you do when, upon waking up, you are unsure if you need a fardh ghusal? In other words, you are not sure if you had emmitted semen whilst sleeping for whatever reson (the signs aren't visible, or only partially etc.) and you don't know whether a bath has become obligatory upon you. Please advise me on this situation.",,,"Praise be to Allah.When a person wakes up and has had an erotic dream, but he does not find any wetness on his clothes, then he does not have to do ghusl, according to scholarly consensus, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked by a woman, “O Messenger of Allah, Allah is not shy of (telling you) the truth. Does a woman have to do ghusl if she has an erotic dream?” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Yes, if she sees water.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 282; Muslim, 313). This indicates that it is not obligatory to do ghusl is one does not see water. Al-Mughni, 1/269. 
But if one finds wetness, this must mean one of three things: 
1 – That one is certain that it is maniy (semen), in which case ghusl is obligatory according to scholarly consensus. Al-Mughni, 1/269.
2 – That one is certain that it is not maniy, in which case ghusl is not obligatory, but this liquid must be washed away, because in this case the ruling is the same as the ruling on urine. Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 1/280.
3 – If he is not sure what it is, and does not know whether it is maniy (semen) or madhiy (prostatic fluid). In this case there is a difference of opinion among the scholars: 
Al-Nawawi stated in al-Majmoo’ (2/146) that the rulings on both maniy and madhiy apply, so he should do ghusl to remove the janaabah (impurity following sexual activity) on the basis that it may be maniy, and he should cleanse his clothes of the impurity on the basis that it might be madhiy – because he cannot discharge his duty of purifying himself without doing that. 
The madhhab of Imam Ahmad, which was also the view preferred by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, is that if he was thinking thoughts of desire before he fell asleep, or if he had played with his wife or looked at her, then this wetness should be counted as madhiy, because the liquid that is emitted because of those things is usually madhiy and the basic principle is that it is not anything else. So he should cleanse his clothes of the madhiy by sprinkling them with water, but he does not have to do ghusl. 
But if he did not think thoughts of desire, or play with or look at his wife before falling asleep, then this wetness is to be considered as maniy, because of the report narrated by ‘Aa’ishah who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about a man who finds some wetness and does not remember having an erotic dream. He said: ‘He should do ghusl.’ And he was asked about a man who thought that he had had an erotic dream but he did not find any wetness. He said, ‘He does not have to do ghusl.’” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 236; classed as hasan by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 216.
 Al-Khattaabi said in Ma’aalim al-Sunan: “The apparent meaning of this hadeeth is that ghusl is obligatory if one sees wetness, even if he is not certain that it is maniy. This opinion was narrated from a group of the Taabi’een, including ‘Ata’, al-Shu’bi and al-Nakha’i.”
 This wetness has to have come out for a reason, and there is no apparent reason other than an erotic dream, and the water that usually comes out because of an erotic dream is maniy. So this uncertainty may be dealt with by going by what is most usual.
 See al-Mughni, 1/270; Sharh al-‘Umdah, 1/353.
 Both opinions are valid, but if you follow the second view it will be sufficient, in sha Allah. If you want to be on the safe side and be sure that your prayer is valid, and you follow the first opinion, that will be better.

22706,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22706,Mixing with relatives who backbite,"I have recently started to make a conscious effort to become a good practicing muslim. Beyond the basics tenants of faith I have also started to read about and gain knowledge about Islam. Keeping ties with relatives is good practice in Islam. To gain the pleasures of Allah (SWT) I am making a conscious effort to meet them whom previously i used to avoid. It seems though the more I and my family mix with relatives the more they talk behind our backs and spread baseless slanderous remarks. This is very hurtful and it takes a lot of patience to ignore and be indifferent to people with such habits. What would be the correct way to deal with the such relatives? Previously i would have confronted such people with anger, but now i know nothing will be gained only bad feelings and anger. Should I leave such people for Allah to deal with? Please advise on this also which duas can i recite to increase my patience?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The attribute of patience is a high status with which Allah blesses whomsoever He wills among His slaves, to make it easy for them to obey His commands and heed His prohibitions. Your attempts to bring people together and to get closer to your relatives is a praiseworthy effort which points to your success and correct thinking. For many people, if they are faced with even a part of what you have suffered, quickly lose patience and respond to cutting off of ties in like manner, because they think that upholding family ties is only obligatory when relatives respond in the same manner. This is a mistaken notion and the fact that it is mistaken is indicated by the hadeeth which was narrated from Abu Hurayrah, which says that a man said, “O Messenger of Allah, I have relatives with whom I uphold the ties of kinship but they cut me off; I treat them well but they mistreat me; I am patient with them but they treat me in an ignorant manner.”  The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If it is as you say, then it is as if you are stuffing hot ashes [in their mouths], and you will have with you [an angel] from Allah to support you against them so long as you continue to be like that.” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 2285).  
In this hadeeth, a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) complaining of his relatives’ bad treatment of him, and in his complaint he mentioned something similar to what you have mentioned: he upheld the ties of kinship but they cut him off, he treated them well but they treated him badly. Yet despite that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told him that if he was telling the truth, then his situation with them would be like one fills their mouths with ashes, so he is the one who is doing the right thing, and he would continue to have support from Allah against them. The general meaning of the hadeeth is to encourage the upholding of family ties even with those who doe not themselves uphold those ties. Praise be to Allah that this is what you have done and have forced yourself to do. I ask Allah to help you to do that which is good. 
After that there is nothing more that you can do except to follow one good deed with another, one kind action with another. If they mistreat you then do to them the opposite of that which they have done to you. 
You should note that when you do that, you are doing it only to earn the pleasure and mercy of Allah. Do not expect any response to your good deed from them. But try not to tell people what they are doing to you. If you think that one of the causes of this problem is too much contact with them, there is nothing wrong with your reducing your visits with them. 
Pray to Allah to guide them; pray to Him when you are certain of a response, for Allah is Able to turn their hatred into love and their neglect into close ties. 
With regard to your question about du`as that will help you to be patient when faced with difficulties, there are many such du`as, and we will tell you some of them here: 
-1- 
It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “When faced with difficulties the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would say: ‘Laa ilaaha ill-Allah al-‘Azeem al-Haleem, laa ilaaha ill-Allah Rabb il-‘Arsh il-‘Azeem, laa ilaaha ill-Allah Rabb ul-samawaati wa Rabb ul-‘Arsh il-Kareem (There is no god except Allah, the Almighty, the Forbearing; there is no god except Allah the Lord of the Mighty Throne; there is no god except Allah, Lord of the heavens and Lord of the noble Throne).’”  (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7426). 
According to a report narrated by Muslim: “When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was concerned about an important matter or when he was worried…” (Muslim, 2130). 
-2- 
It was narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was distressed by something, he would say, ‘Ya Hayyu, ya Qayyoom, bi rahmatika astagheeth (O Ever-Living, O Eternal One, by Your mercy I seek help).’” (narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3524); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 4777). 
We also want to tell you of something important which will help you to be more patient and will give you certain faith in Allah, especially when you are upset and worried. This is something which many people neglect. Do you know what it is? 
It is prayer, for prayer has a great effect in bringing peace to the heart and in dispelling worries and distress. It is one of the greatest means of being patient. This is indicated by the Quran and Sunnah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And seek help in patience and As-Salaah (the prayer) and truly, it is extremely heavy and hard except for Al-Khaashi‘oon [i.e. the true believers in Allah — those who obey Allah with full submission, fear much from His punishment, and believe in His Promise (Paradise) and in His Warnings (Hell)]”
[al-Baqarah 2:45]
Prayer is the greatest thing by means of which help may be sought.
 And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Indeed, We know that your breast is straitened at what they say.
So glorify the praises of your Lord and be of those who prostrate themselves (to Him).
And worship your Lord until there comes unto you the certainty (i.e. death)” [al-Hijr 15:97-99]
 Imaam Ibn Jareer al-Tabari said in his Tafseer: “ ‘So glorify the praises of your Lord’: with regard to matters which are worrying you, turn to Allah and give thank to Allah and praise Him, and pray, and Allah will take care of that which is troubling you.
 This is similar to the hadeeth narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): ‘When something troubled him, he would turn to prayer.’” (7/553)
 Finally I ask Allah the Almighty, the Lord of the Mighty Throne, to bless us and you with certain faith, for He is Able to do that.

22713,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22713,Wearing gloves made of pigskin,"I'm working with a company where the workers always use pig skin gloves. To my understanding, anything that comes from pig is haram and if touched, I have to wash my hand 7 times plus 1 time with soil. In this case, what should I do?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We have previously stated in the answer to question no. 1695 that pigskin is najis (impure) and does not become taahir (pure) by means of tanning. 
Simply touching something impure does not make the body impure, unless there is some wetness either in the impure substance or on the body. 
Shaykh Ibn Jibreen said: 
If the body or clothes are dry and touch something impure that is also dry, that does not matter, because the impurity is only transferred when it is wet. Fataawa Islamiyyah, 1/194 
Based on this, the hand does not become impure simply by touching these gloves that are made of pigskin, unless the hand or the gloves are wet. 
If the hands become impure by touching the pigskin when there is some wetness, then you have to wash your hands. It is sufficient to wash them once, because there is no command to wash something impure seven times, one of which is with dust or dirt, except in the case of impurity caused by a dog. 
Some scholars likened the pig to the dog, so they said that one should wash seven times in the case of pig-related impurity, one of which should be with dust or dirt. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “This is a weak analogy, because pigs are mentioned in the Qur’aan and they existed at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and there is no report which likens them to dogs. So the correct view is that pig-related impurity is like any other kind of impurity, and there is no need to wash seven times, one of which should be with dust or dirt.”  Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 1/356. 
So the Muslim should strive to keep his body and clothes clean and pure, and avoid wearing these gloves that are made of pigskin, because that involves touching something impure and exposes his hands and clothes to the risk of becoming impure, which would affect the validity of his prayers. But if he needs to wear these gloves because he cannot find anything else, then it is permissible for him to wear them, so long as he is careful to avoid contaminating his body or clothes, and he hastens to wash off any impurity if he gets it on him, so that he does not transfer it anywhere else or forget to wash it off his hands or clothes. 
There are permissible kinds of animal skins and leathers available which mean that there is no need for these impure types. We ask Allah to help us to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.

22722,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22722,Ruling on gathering to make du`a and recite Quran,"In the Muslim community on our campus, there arose a controversy on issue of coming together on a set date to make dua'h (supplications), therein the whole Quran is recited(leaflets of the Quran are distributed and read simultaneously) and supplications made, for such reasons as; success in examination and beginning of semester exam. 
We want to ask if such prayers is established in the Shareeah of Islam. It will be appreciated if your responce is backed by Quran, Sunnah and Ijmaa of the salaf. 
Your Fatwa, backed with the requested evidences, will Insha Allah bring to rest the controversy.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The ruling on gathering to recite Quran, whereby each of the people present takes a juz’ (part) of the Quran at the same time, so that each of them can complete the juz’ that he has. 
The answer to this is what was stated in a fatwa of the Standing Committee (2/480), which was as follows: 
Firstly: gathering to recite and study the Quran, whereby one of them recites and the others listen, and they study it together and explain the meanings, is something that is prescribed in Islam and is an act of worship that Allah loves and for which He rewards greatly. It was narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh and by Abu Dawood from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No people gather in one of the houses of Allah, reciting the Book of Allah and studying it together, but tranquillity descends upon them and mercy encompasses them, and the angels surround them, and Allah mentions them to those who are with Him.” 
It is also prescribed to recite du`a upon completing the Quran, but not every single time, and there is no specific form of du`a which is to be followed as if it were a Sunnah, because none of that has been proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him); rather this is something that some of the Sahaabah did (may Allah be pleased with them). 
Similarly there is nothing wrong with inviting those who attended the recitation to a meal, so long as that is not taken as a habit after every reading. 
Secondly: 
Giving ajza’ (parts) of the Quran to those who attend the gathering so that each of them may read a part of the Quran by himself is not regarded as meaning that each of them has completed the Quran.  
Their intention of reading Quran for the purpose of seeking blessing is not enough, because the purpose of reading Quran is to draw closer to Allah and to memorize Quran, ponder its meanings, understand its rulings, learn lessons from it, earn reward and make one's tongue get used to reciting it, etc. And Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and companions.” 
Secondly: 
There is no evidence to support the belief that this action (gathering to read Quran in the manner mentioned) will have the effect of bringing a response to du`a, therefore it is not prescribed. There are many well-known means of seeking an answer to du`as. just as there are many well-known impediments to receiving a response. The person who is making du`a should pursue the means of receiving a response and avoid the impediments, and he should think well of his Lord, because Allah is as His slave thinks He is. 
See also question no. 5113. 
Note: Evidence is required of the one who claims that something is prescribed in Islam, otherwise the basic principle with regard to acts of worship is that they are not allowed unless there is proven evidence that they are prescribed. Based on this, the evidence that this belief is not prescribed is the fact that there is no evidence to suggest that it is permitted.

I tried to convince them but I did not succeed. They threatened to cut me off if I went ahead and married her, but I did not pay attention to their threat. I went ahead and married her, and my family have carried out their threat and cut me off completely.
, I am happy with my wife but I feel very sad about my family’s attitude and their letting me down treatment at the time when I needed them to stand by my side. I have tried to reconcile with them after my marriage and I have asked some good people to mediate, but without success. Now after nearly a year I feel that we are very far apart and that the rift between us is even deeper. Am I committing sin in my attitude, and does my mother have the right to use her right that I should honour her as a means to force me to do what she wants and and take away my right to decide my future and to choose my life partner? May Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Our advice to parents and siblings is not to 
    prevent sons from getting married to whomever they want, if she is religiously-committed and of good character. 
They should strive to make their sons happy; 
    marrying a son to a woman he does not like puts him in a difficult situation: either he will divorce her or he will live with her even though he 
    does not like her and his heart is attached to another. This is harmful for him and for her, and exposes the family to disintegration. 
The parents do not have the right to force 
    their son to marry someone whom he does not like, and it is not permissible for them to cut him off if he goes against them in that. It is haraam 
    for a believer to forsake his fellow-believer unless there is a shar’i reason for doing so. 
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for a Muslim to forsake his brother for more than three days.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6065. The 
    sin is more serious if the forsaking for no reason involves a son, mother, brother or other relative, because in that case he is combining two 
    sins: forsaking a Muslim and severing the ties of kinship. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him) said: 
The parents have no right to force their son 
    to marry someone he does not want. If he refuses he is not being disobedient; it is like forcing him to eat something he does not want. 
    al-Ikhtiyaaraat, p. 344 
Based on this, what you did was not a sin, but you have to continue to honour your mother and 
    uphold the ties of kinship with your sisters as much as you can. Try to reconcile with them. Go to your mother, kiss her head and hand, for she 
    only wants you to be happy. Tell her that you are happy and ask her for her approval. 
Do the same with your sisters. 
If they continue to cut you off, then ask 
    Allaah’s help and continue to honour them and uphold the ties of kinship with them. Remember the words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him): “The upholder of kinship ties is not the one who is kind to them if they are kind to him, rather the upholder of kinship ties 
    is the one who, if his relatives cut him off, he upholds the ties of kinship with them.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5991.

That was a sign of his truthfulness, and that he was indeed the promised Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
The description of the Seal of Prophethood has been narrated in the saheeh Sunnah. It was an area of raised skin the size of a pigeon’s egg, between the shoulders of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It was surrounded by moles and on it were some hairs. 
Al-Qurtubi said: 
The proven ahaadeeth are agreed that the Seal of Prophethood was something raised near his left shoulder, the size of a pigeon’s egg. 
There is no proof that the name of Allaah or the name Muhammad were written on the Seal, or any other words. 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Baari (6/650): 
With regard to what has been narrated about it being like the mark of a cupping glass, or like a black or green mole, or that the words “Muhammad Rasool Allaah (Muhammad the Messenger of Allaah)” or “Sir fa anta’l-mansoor (Go forth for you have Divine support)” etc were written on it, none of these reports have been proven. Do not be deceived by what was narrated in Saheeh Ibn Hibbaan because he was mistaken when he classed that as saheeh. And Allaah knows best. 
There follow some of the ahaadeeth that have been narrated concerning the Seal of Prophethood: 
1 – Muslim (2344) narrated that Jaabir ibn Samurah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “I saw the Seal by his shoulder, like a pigeon’s egg, resembling his body” i.e., its colour was like the rest of his body. 
2 – Muslim (2346) also narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Sarjis said: “I saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and I ate bread and meat with him (or he said, thareed – a meat dish)… then I went behind him and I looked at the Seal of Prophethood between his shoulders, near the top of his left shoulder, the shape of a hand with the fingers together (but smaller in size, the size of a pigeon’s egg), with moles on it.”  
See Sharh Muslim by al-Nawawi. 
3 – al-Tirmidhi narrated in al-Shamaa’il that Abu Zayd ‘Amr ibn Akhtab al-Ansaari said: “I touched his back, and my fingers touched the Seal.” He was asked, “What is the Seal?” He said, “A number of hairs growing together.”

Significance of documenting marriage","Praise be to Allah.Conditions of valid marriage
In order for a marriage to be valid , there must be agreement from both parties, and the presence of the woman’s wali (guardian) and two Muslim witnesses of good character, and there should be no impediments in the case of either partner. 
If these conditions are met, and the contract is done by means of the proposal and acceptance by the wali and the husband, then the marriage is done. 
Significance of documenting marriage
Recording and documenting the marriage are done only to protect people’s rights and to avoid disputes. 
Based on this, if you agree to do the marriage in the manner described above, and on the basis that you will delay the registration and documentation until you go back to your country or until it becomes easier for you to go to an Islamic center, then there is nothing wrong with that. 
You should announce the marriage , and inform your neighbors and relatives of it, so that legitimate marriage will be made distinct from illicit relationships. 
It is preferable to hasten to register the marriage at the first opportunity, and strive to do that so as to ward off any suspicion and so as to protect people’s rights, especially if Allah blesses you with children.

22747,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22747,Fasting and Praying to Have Supplications Answered,"Can one go to Al Haram (the Sacred Mosque) to pray for one's needs, e.g to pray for cure from sickness , to pray to have children, etc. Also, can one fast for some days for the purpose of requesting one's needs from Allah for the reasons stated above? (i.e. to pray for children, etc).",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is no reason why a Muslim should not pray in al-Masjid al-Haram for the purpose of supplication, but it is better for him not to restrict his intention in the prayer to supplication. Rather his intention should be to worship Allah through this prayer and to hope for its reward in the Hereafter. Moreover, prayer includes dhikr (remembrance of Allah), reciting the Quran, bowing, prostrating and du’a(supplication), so the du’a should just be a part of the prayer; it is not the primary purpose. Al-Masjid al-Haram is one of the blessed and most venerated places, so if a person prays and calls upon Allah whilst prostrating, for example – then he will have combined the virtue of the place with the virtue of the action. If this is done during the last third of the night, he will also add the virtue of the time. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
With regard to the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “As for ruku’ (bowing position), glorify your Lord therein, and as for sujood (prostration) strive in du’a therein, because then it is more likely that you will be answered” (narrated by Muslim, 479, from the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him)) – this contains the command to glorify Allah in ruku’, and the command to supplicate when prostrating indicates that du’a in sujood is more likely to be answered than in ruku’. Hence he said, “because then it is more likely that you will be answered”. And he said, “The closest that the slave is to his Lord is when he is prostrating.” (Narrated by Muslim 482 from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him)). This is a command that du’a should be said in sujood. Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 22/378 
And he said: 
Du’a is answered when rain is falling, when battle is joined, when the adhan and iqaamah (call to prayer) are given, following prayers, when prostrating, and when offered by one who is fasting, one who is travelling and one who is oppressed, and so on. All of this is narrated in well-known haadeeths (reports) in the books of Saheeh and Sunan. Du’a is also likely to be answered in the sacred places such as ‘Arafah, Muzdalifah, Mina, the Multazim and other sacred places in Makkah, and in the mosques in general. The greater the virtue of the mosque – such as the three Sacred Mosques [in Makkah, Madeenah and Jerusalem] – the better prayers and du’as are in them. Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 27/129-130 
On the other hand it may be said: 
Doing righteous deeds in the hope that du’a will be answered is something that is prescribed in sharee’ah. Hence doing wudu and praying in al-Masjid al-Haram may be included among the righteous deeds that may be done before starting du’a in the hope that that the du’a will be answered.   
It was narrated from ‘Uthman ibn Hunayf (may Allah be pleased with him) that a blind man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: Pray to Allah to heal me. He said, “If you wish, you may delay the reward until the Hereafter, for that is better, or if you wish, I will supplicate for you.” He said, Supplicate. So he told him to do wudu and do it well, and to pray two rak’ahs (units of prayer), and to say this du’a: “Allahumma inni as’aluka wa atawajjahu ilayka bi Muhammadin Nabi al-rahmah. Ya Muhammad inni qad tawajjahtu bika ila rabbiy fi hajati hadhihi li tuqda. Allaahumma shaffi’hu fiyya (O Allah, I ask of You and I turn my face towards You by the virtue of Muhammad the Prophet of Mercy. O Muhammad, I have turned my face by virtue of you to my Lord concerning this need of mine so that it may be met. O Allah, accept his intercession concerning me).”  
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3578; Ibn Majah, 1385; this hadeeth was classed as saheeh (authentic) by al-Tirmidhi and by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Jami’, 1279 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded him to do wudu and pray two rak’ahs before he supplicated; this indicates that prayer is one of the righteous deeds by virtue of which a person’s du’a may be more likely to be answered, and that may be one of the causes of the du’a being answered. 
With regard to fasting, what has been said with regard to prayer may also be said with regard to fasting. The intention behind it should be to worship Allah by means of this great act of worship, and to attain the reward for it in the Hereafter, and to fear Allah and earn His pleasure. Then if he is fasting, it is mustahabb (desirable) for the fasting person to supplicate a lot, for the du’a of the fasting person will be answered, especially at the time of breaking the fast.

    the bone of a dead person is like breaking his bone when he is alive.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 3207). This indicates that the dead person has a

The same ruling applies to men, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Water is for water.” 
With regard to his fast, it is valid, because a wet dream is not something that happens by choice. Similarly, thinking is something which is forgiven by Allah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has forgiven my Ummah for wrong thoughts that cross their minds , so long as they do not speak of them or act upon them.”

The Muslim should beware of attributing words to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) without knowing how sound they are, because telling lies about him is not like telling lies about anyone else. 
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever tells lies about me, let him take his place in Hell.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 107; Muslim, 3. And he said: “Do

And he said: “Whoever narrated a hadeeth from 
    me knowing that it is false, then he is one of the liars.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1). 
The best way of sending blessings upon the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is that which he taught to his companions: 
Al-Bukhaari (6357) and Muslim (406) narrated 
    that ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Abi Layla said: Ka’b ibn ‘Ujrah met me and said to me, Shall I not give you a gift? The Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) came out to us and we said, “O Messenger of Allaah, we know how to send salaams upon you, but how should we send blessings 
    upon you?” He said, “Say: Allaahumma salli ‘ala Muhammad wa ‘ala aali Muhammad kama salayta ‘ala aali Ibraaheem, innaka hameedun majeed; 
    Allaahumma baarik ‘ala Muhammad wa ‘ala aali Muhammad kama baarakta ‘ala aali Ibraaheem, innaka hameedun majeed (O Allaah, send prayers upon 
    Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent prayers upon the family of Ibraaheem, verily You are Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory. O 
    Allaah, send blessings upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent blessings upon the family of Ibraaheem, verily You are Worthy of 
    Praise, Full of Glory). 
Al-Bukhaari (3369) and Muslim (6360) narrated 
    from Abu Humayd al-Saa’idi (may Allaah be pleased with him) that they said: “O Messenger of Allaah, how should we send blessings upon you?” The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Say Allaahumma salli ‘ala Muhammadin wa azwaajihi wa dhurriyyatihi 
    kama salayta ‘ala aali Ibraaheem, wa baarik ‘ala Muhammadin wa azwaajihi wa dhurriyyatihi kama baarakta ‘ala aali Ibraaheem, innaka hameedun 
    majeed (O Allaah, send prayers upon Muhammad and his wives and progeny as You sent prayers upon the family of Ibraaheem, and send blessings 
    upon Muhammad and his wives and progeny as You sent blessings upon the family of Ibraaheem, verily You are Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory). 
Al-Suyooti (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said: I read in al-Tabaqaat by al-Taaj al-Subki, quoting from his father, the words: “The best words with which a person can send blessings 
    upon the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) are the words that appear in the Tashahhud. 
He said: Whoever says these words has sent 
    blessings upon the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) for certain, and whoever says any other words, there is some doubt as 
    to whether he has sent blessings in the required manner, because they said, ‘How should we send blessings upon you?’ and he said, ‘Say…’ So he 
    stated that sending blessings upon him is done in that manner. 
He said: When I was young, when I sent 
    blessings upon the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) I used to say, ‘Allaahumma salli wa baarik wa sallam ‘ala Muhammad 
    wa ‘ala aali Muhammad, kama salayta wa baarakta wa salamta ‘ala Ibraaheem was ‘ala aali Ibraaheem, innaka hameedun majeed (O Allaah, send 
    prayers and blessings and peace upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent prayers and blessings and peace upon Ibraaheem and the 
    family of Ibraaheem), but then it was said to me in a dream, Are you more eloquent or concise or more knowledgeable about the meanings of words 
    than the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? If there had been any more eloquent words, the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) would not have chosen these words. So I sought forgiveness for that and went back to the words of the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
And he said: If anyone swears to send the best of prayers upon the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), then these words are the best he can say.

“O (you) Messengers! Eat of the Tayyibaat [all kinds of Halaal (lawful) foods which Allah has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables, fruits)] and do righteous deeds. Verily, I am Well‑Acquainted with what you do” [Al-Mu’minoon 23:51]
 “O you who believe (in the Oneness of Allah — Islamic Monotheism)! Eat of the lawful things that We have provided you with, and be grateful to Allah, if it is indeed He Whom you worship” [Al-Baqarah 2:172]

22758,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22758,Is covering the head a shar’i obligation?,Could you give the scholars or mazhab names that their opinion stated that man also obligatory to cover their head.,,,"Praise be to Allah.We do not know of anyone among the scholars 
    who said that covering the head is obligatory for men, but a number of scholars have said that it is mustahabb, and they describe baring one’s 
    head in front of people as being one of the things that undermine a man's status and character, especially if the man is elderly or is a scholar; 
    if one of these people uncovers his head, that is worse than if anyone else does it. 
The correct view is that it is not one of the 
    things that undermine a man's status and character in all eras and in all environments, rather the ruling on that varies according to people’s 
    customs. 
Al-Shaatibi (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    divided people’s customs into two categories: 
1 – Those concerning which there is shar’i 
    evidence as to whether it is good or bad. In this case reference is to be made to sharee’ah, and what is customary among the people is of no 
    importance. 
For example, uncovering the ‘awrah is 
    reprehensible according to sharee’ah, even though many people are accustomed to doing that. 
Removing impurity is something that is good 
    and is enjoined by sharee’ah, although many people do not pay attention to impurity on their clothes and do not protect themselves from that. 
2 – Things which are customary among people 
    and there is no shar’i evidence to prohibit it or enjoin it. 
Such things are of two types: 

    (a)
    Established customs that do not change, such as the desire for food and drink. 
(b)Customs that change, such as whether an action is regarded as good or bad, which varies from one 
    society to another.
Al-Shaatibi described this type by saying, 
    “Such as uncovering the head, which varies from one place to another; in the lands of the east (i.e. Egypt and lands to the east) it is 
    reprehensible for people of prominent status, and in the lands of the west (i.e., North Africa and Islamic Spain) it is not reprehensible. The 
    shar’i ruling varies accordingly; for people in the east it is to be regarded as undermining a man’s status and character, whereas for the people 
    in the west it is not. 
Al-Muwaaqifaat, 
    2/284 
The point is that covering the head for men is one of the issues concerning which reference 
    should be made to what is customary among the people. A man should do what is customary in the society in which he lives, so long as that does not 
    go against sharee’ah, and so that he will not stand out by being different from them in his clothing etc in the manner that is forbidden in 
    sharee’ah.

Also my father is very controlling, picking and choosing what he wishes to believe in terms of religion, he likes to show off his wealth and power and build his name, can you give me any supplications which will help to make him a more mild mannered and diplomatic man? I would be very grateful if you could help me in this matter.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The presence of the wali (guardian) is one of the conditions of marriage, and a woman’s marriage is not valid unless this condition is met. This is the correct view and is the view of the majority of scholars. See question no. 2127. 
The person who has the most right to be a woman’s guardian is her father, but if it is proven that he is not qualified for this role then it moves to the next closest relative, such as her grandfather for example. 
For more information on this issue, with evidence, please see question no. 7193 and 31119. 
Secondly: 
With regard to the conditions and qualities that should be present in the husband, the most important of these is religious commitment. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If there comes to you one with whose religious commitment and character you are pleased, then marry [your daughter or female relative under your care] to him, for if you do not do that there will be fitnah (tribulation) on earth and much corruption.”  Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1005) and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 1084. 
See also question no. 6942 and 5202. 
Thirdly: 
One of the shar’i conditions of marriage is the consent of the wife, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “A previously-married woman should not be married without consulting her and a virgin should not be married without asking her permission.” They said, “O Messenger of Allaah, how does she give her permission?” He said, “If she remains silent.”  Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4741; Muslim, 2543. 
No one has the right to force a girl to marry anyone, but at the same time she does not have the right to get married without her guardian’s permission. 
The presence of the guardian is an important condition for a marriage to be valid, but a girl should not be forced into marrying someone who she does not want to marry, and she is not regarded as disobeying her parents in this case. Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said: “The parents do not have the right to force their son to marry someone whom he does not want, and if he refuses he is not being disobedient, like eating something that he does not want.” Al-Ikhtiyaaraat, p. 344 
Fourthly: 
With regard to your father and the way he is, we offer the following advice: 
(i) Make du’aa’ for him in his absence. There is no specific du’aa’, so pray to Allaah to reform him and open his heart.
(ii) Seek the help of some of your father’s friends or relatives whom you trust to try to change him.
(iii) Give him some books or tapes in your language that will encourage him to have a good attitude and warn him against the opposite, and give them as a gift using a good approach when you do so. Allaah may make this a cause of his reforming.
We ask Allaah to help you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.

22765,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22765,When to Read Evening Adhkar,"Is there a set time for reciting the morning and evening dhikrs, and if there is a set time but I do not remember until after that time has ended, should I still recite them, or not?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The correct view is that there is a set time for reciting the morning and evening dhikrs, because of the time mentioned in many ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in which he said: “Whoever says such and such in the morning…” and “whoever says such and such in the evening…” 
But the scholars differed to the exact start and end of the time in the morning and the evening. Some of the scholars said that the time in the morning begins when the dawn comes, and ends when the sun rises. Others said that it ends when the forenoon (al-duha) ends, but the preferred time for dhikr is from when dawn begins until the sun has risen. With regard to the evening, some scholars said that the time (for dhikr) begins at the time of ‘Asr and ends when the sun sets, and others said that the time lasts until one-third of the night has passed. And some of them said that the time for the evening dhikr starts after sunset. 
Perhaps the most appropriate view is that a person should strive to recite the morning dhikrs between dawn and sunrise, then if he misses that it will be acceptable if he recites them before the time of the forenoon (al-duha) ends, which is shortly before the time for Zuhr prayer. And he should recite the evening dhikrs between the time of ‘Asr and Maghrib, then if he misses that it will be acceptable if he recites them before one-third of the night has passed. The evidence for this preference is the fact that the Qur’aan urges us to remember Allah in the early morning (bukoor) and in the late afternoon (‘ashiy), which is the time between ‘Asr and Maghrib. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘and glorify the Praises of your Lord, before the rising of the sun and before (its) setting’ [Qaaf 50:39]
This is the interpretation of what is mentioned in the ahaadeeth, ‘Whoever says such and such in the morning… and in the evening’. What is meant by this is before the sun rises, and before it sets. The time for that is between dawn and sunrise, and between ‘Asr and Maghrib. And Allah says: 
‘and glorify the praises of your Lord in the ‘Ashi (i.e. the time period after the midnoon till sunset) and in the Ibkaar (i.e. the time period from early morning or sunrise till before midnoon)’ [Ghaafir 40:55]
Ibkaar means the first part of the day, and ‘ashiy means the latter part. So the time for these dhikrs is after Fajr and after ‘Asr.” 
(Summarized from al-Waabil al-Sayyib, 200. See also Sharh al-Adhkaar al-Nawawiyyah by Ibn ‘Allaaj, 3/74, 75, 100). 
There are also dhikrs to be recited during the night, as was narrated in the hadeeth: “Whoever recites the last two verses of Soorat al-Baqarah at night, that will be sufficient for him.” (al-Bukhaari, 4008; Muslim, 807). And it is known that the night starts at sunset (Maghrib) and ends at dawn. So the Muslim must strive to recite every dhikr that is connected to a specific time at the right time, but if he misses it, should he make it up or not? 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “With regard to making it up if he forgets it, I hope that he will be rewarded for that.”

22769,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22769,"Will an adulterer be deprived of al-hoor al-‘ayn? What is the meaning of the hadeeth “Whoever commits adultery, the same will be done to him (i.e., his womenfolk)”?","If a man commits zina then repents, will he be deprived of al-hoor al-‘ayn in the Hereafter? And what is the meaning of the phrase “the same will be done to him (i.e., his womenfolk), even within the walls of his house?” If that refers to his mahrams.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If an adulterer or anyone else who has committed a sin repents sincerely, Allaah will accept his repentance and expiate for his bad deeds, as is indicated by a great deal of evidence in the Qur’aan and Sunnah. For example, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say: O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Zumar 39:53] 
Indeed, if his repentance is good, his bad deeds may be replaced with good, by the immense grace and mercy of Allaah, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who invoke not any other ilaah (god) along with Allaah, nor kill such person as Allaah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.
The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace;
Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Furqaan 25:68-70] 
What is implied by the forgiveness of Allaah and His acceptance of repentance is that He will not punish him. 
But if a person persists in committing zina and does not repent from it, then it is proven that such a person will suffer different kinds of punishment, in this world, in the grave and in the Hereafter. We do not find any text that states that he will be deprived of al-hoor al-‘ayn, but some of the scholars have reached this conclusion by analogy with the proven warning concerning one who dies without repenting from drinking wine, who will not drink it in the Hereafter; and one who does not repent from wearing silk in this world, who will not wear it in the Hereafter. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) listed the punishments that will befall the one who commits zina, if he does not repent:
 “He exposes himself to missing out on the enjoyment of al-hoor al-‘ayn in the blessed abode of the Paradise of ‘Aden (the Garden of Eden). For Allaah will punish the one who wears silk in this world by depriving him of it on the Day of Resurrection; and He will punish the one who drinks wine in this world by depriving him of it on the Day of Resurrection; so by the same token He will punish the one who enjoyed haraam intimacy in this world. Indeed, everything of haraam things that a person enjoyed in this world, he will be deprived of its legitimate counterpart in the Hereafter.” 
(Rawdat al-Muhibbeen by Ibn al-Qayyim, 365-368) 
With regard to the hadeeth which says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said “Whoever commits adultery, the same will be done to him (i.e., his womenfolk), even within the walls of his house”, this is a fabricated (mawdoo’) hadeeth, as was stated by al-Suyooti and Ibn ‘Arraaq, and by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah, 2/155.
Based on that, there is no point to your objection. Even if the hadeeth were saheeh, it could be interpreted in a sound manner, which is that a man who commits zina and persists in it is one of the immoral and corrupt, and this corruption will have an effect on his family, because it will influence his family and make them corrupt as well. If the head of the household is careless about his own attitude, he will be even more careless about his family, and he will not discipline them to follow their religion properly. As a result, it is not unlikely that they will fall into the same sins as he did, because their faith is weak. In fact there are many stories from real life which point to such cases. This is one of the punishments which are hastened in this world, by means of which Allaah punishes those who violate the honour of the Muslims, so Allaah causes their honour to be violated in turn, as a fitting punishment. Allaah does whatsoever He wills, in accordance with the utmost wisdom and perfect justice, and He is never unjust towards anyone. He is not to be questioned as to what He does, and He is the Most Wise, All-Knowing.",Islam Q&A
22782,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22782,How should the Muslim honour his parents?,"My problem may be summed up by staying that my father and mother are always arguing, because my father is sarcastic and offensive, and his character is very unfriendly and difficult to know.
 My brothers and I are very afraid of him. We do not talk to him except in shallow terms. I want to please my Lord and attain Paradise, and I have read about the importance of honouring one’s parents. But I am very confused. How can I honour my father when I do not know how?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allah has mentioned kind treatment of parents alongside the command to worship Him alone. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents” [al-Isra’ 17:23] 
“Worship Allah and join none with Him (in worship); and do good to parents…” [al-Nisa’ 4:36]
This is indicative of the importance of honouring one’s parents and treating them well. 
Honouring one’s parents means obeying them, respecting them, praying for them, lowering one's voice in their presence, smiling at them, lowering the wing of humility to them, not showing displeasure towards them, striving to serve them, fulfilling their wishes, consulting them, listening to what they say, not being stubborn towards them and respecting their friends both during their lifetime and after they have died. 
That also includes not travelling without their permission, not sitting in a place higher than theirs, not starting to eat before they do, and not showing preference to your wife or child over them. 
Honouring them also means visiting them, offering them gifts, thanking them for bringing you up and treating you kindly when you were small and after you grew up. 
It also means striving to reduce the arguments between them, by offering sincere advice and reminding them as much as you can, and making excuses to the one who is wronged, and saying and doing things to calm them down. 
No matter how your father treats you, you should follow the good manners described above, so as to avoid everything that may make him angry or upset, so long as that does not lead to sin or disobedience towards Allah, because the rights of Allah come before the rights of other people.

I used to live a happy life, although unislamic (except I used to pray and fast and reasonable hijab). Then since i got married, I started to become religious Alhamdulillah. But this is when my problems started. I always think to myself that I was not that bad in my life before marriage (as compared to other people who are much more unreligious), and I have not done many sins. So why is all this happening to me and what is the solution?",,,"Praise be to Allah.and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allah, who said: “Allah has shared out your attitudes among you just as He has shared out your provisions. Allah gives worldly provision to those whom He loves and those whom He does not love, but He gives religion only to those whom He loves. So whoever is given religion, Allah loves him…” (Narrated by Ahmad, 3490; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 714). Based on this hadeeth, you should praise Allah a great deal for this blessing which He has bestowed upon you by enabling you to adhere to His religion. Note that trials are the nature of this world which is the world of tests and trials. 
“and We shall make a trial of you with evil and with good. And to Us you will be returned”
[al-Anbiya’ 21:35 – interpretation of the meaning]
In the face of every trial the Muslim’s attitude should be that of one who is certain that Allah does not decree for him anything but that which is good for his worldly and spiritual affairs. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “How wonderful is the affair of the believer, for his affairs are all good, and this applies to no one but the believer. If something good happens to him, he is thankful for it and that is good for him. If something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience and that is good for him.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2999). 
Everything that you have mentioned in your question comes under the heading of being tested by means of things that no person would want. What you must do is to bear it with patience and realize that all of that comes for Allah for the purpose of good which He wants for you. 
Adherence to the commands of Allah is not the cause of the trials that have befallen you, because one of the things stated by sharee’ah is that righteousness is one of the causes of happiness and that the opposite is the cause of misery. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings): 
“Whoever works righteousness — whether male or female — while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision)” [al-Nahl 16:97]
“then whoever follows My Guidance he shall neither go astray, nor shall be distressed.
But whosoever turns away from My Reminder (i.e. neither believes in this Quran nor acts on its teachings) verily, for him is a life of hardship” [Ta-Ha 20:123-124]
Faith brings true happiness in both this world and in the Hereafter, and turning away from the remembrance of Allah causes misery and hardship. True happiness is in the heart and is not cancelled out by whatever trials may befall the believer. Indeed the trials of this world happened to the Prophets too, as it says in the hadeeth: “The people who are most sorely tried are the Prophets, then those who are closest to them, then those who are next closest.” (Ahmad, 26539; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilat al-Saheehah, 1165). According to another version, “A man will be tested according to the level of his religious commitment, and the trials will keep affecting a slave of Allah until he is left walking on the face of the earth with no burden of sin whatsoever.” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 4013; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan Ibn Maajah, 3249).  As stated above, in the first hadeeth quoted, ease and hardship in this life are not related to a person’s religious commitment. 
What we advise you to do is to strive to make yourself be patient and keep away from corrupt thoughts and from thinking negatively about Allah. Do not let your adherence to Islam weaken because of these thoughts. One of the most important means that will help you to achieve this is making du’aa’. Indeed, difficulties may be a means of a person making more du’aa’ to his Lord, which will open the door to much good for him. Choose the du’aa’s from the Quran and Sunnah that are appropriate to seeking relief from distress, such as the prayer of Ayyoob: 
“Verily, distress has seized me, and You are the Most Merciful of all those who show mercy”
[al-Anbiya’ 21:83 – interpretation of the meaning]
Be certain that you will receive a response, and do not be in too much of a hurry, for Allah is more merciful towards His slave than a mother to her child. Strive to protect yourself with dhikr as prescribed in sharee’ah. 
Another thing that will help you to be patient is to read the seerah (biography) of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the trials and hardships that he endured. You should also ponder the reward for those who are patient in this world and in the Hereafter. One of the most useful books on this topic is ‘Uddat al_Saabireen by Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him). [Note: an abridged translation of this book is available in English under the title “Patience and Gratitude”, Ta-Ha Publishers, London, UK]
