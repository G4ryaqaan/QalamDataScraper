41003,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41003,How Many Names Does Allah Have?,"Are there only ninety-nine names of Allah, or are there more than that?","Scholars agree that the Beautiful Names of Allah are not limited to 99 names. The hadith: Allah has 99 names, etc., does not mean that Allah does not have any names apart from these, rather it means that whoever learns these 99 of His names will enter Paradise.",,"Praise be to Allah.Al-Bukhari (2736) and Muslim (2677) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has ninety-nine names, one hundred less one. Whoever learns them will enter Paradise.” 
Some of the scholars (such as Ibn Hazm – may Allah have mercy on him) understood this hadith as meaning that the names of Allah are limited to this number. (Al-Muhalla, 1/51)
But what Ibn Hazm said is not supported by the majority of scholars. Rather some of them (such as al-Nawawi) narrated that the scholars agreed that the names of Allah are not limited to this number. It seems that they regarded the view of Ibn Hazm as odd and as something that should not be paid any attention.
In support of the view that the beautiful names of Allah are not limited to this number, they quoted the report narrated by Ahmad (3704) from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no-one who is afflicted by distress and grief, and says: ‘Allahumma inni ‘abduka ibn ‘abdika ibn amatika nasyati bi yadika, madin fiyya hukmuka, ‘adlun fiyya qada-uka. As-aluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw anzaltahu fi kitabika aw ‘allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw istatharta bihi fi ‘ilm il-ghayb ‘indaka an taj’al al-Qurana rabi’a qalbi wa nura sadri wa jala-a huzni wa dhahab hammi (O Allah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave, son of Your maidservant; my forelock is in Your hand, Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You which You have named Yourself with, or revealed in Your Book, or You taught to any of Your creation, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You, that You make the Quran the life of my heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety),’ but Allah will take away his distress and grief, and replace it with joy.” He was asked: “O Messenger of Allah, should we learn this?” He said: “Of course; everyone who hears it should learn it.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Sahihah, 199) 
The phrase “or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You” indicates that there are beautiful names of Allah that He has kept with Him in the knowledge of the Unseen, and which none of His creation has come to know. This indicates that there are more than ninety-nine Names. 
Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said concerning this hadith in Majmu’ al-Fatawa (6/374):  
“This indicates that Allah has more than ninety-nine names.” 
And he said (22/482): 
Al-Khattabi said: 
“This indicates that He has names that He has preserved with Him, and that indicates that the words “Allah has ninety-nine names , whoever learns them will enter Paradise” mean that there are ninety-nine of His names which whoever learns them will enter Paradise. This is like saying, “I have one thousand dirhams which I have prepared to give to charity,” even if his wealth is greater than that. In the Quran Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah, so call on Him by them.” [al-A’raf 7:180]
Allah has commanded us to call upon Him by His names in general terms, He did not say that He has only ninety-nine names. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) stated in Sharh Sahih Muslim that the scholars were unanimously agreed on that, and he said: 
“The scholars unanimously agreed that this hadith does not mean that Allah has only ninety-nine names, or that He does not have any other names apart from these ninety-nine. Rather what the hadith means is that whoever learns these ninety-nine will enter Paradise. The point is that one may enter Paradise by learning them, not that the number is limited to these names.” 
And Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin was asked about that and replied: 
“The names of Allah are not limited to a certain number. The evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the sahih hadith: “O Allah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave… I ask You by every name belonging to You which You have named Yourself with, or revealed in Your Book, or You taught to any of Your creation, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You.” 
What Allah has preserved in the knowledge of the unseen with Him cannot be known and what is not known is unlimited. 
With regard to the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Allah has ninety-nine names, one hundred less one. Whoever learns them will enter Paradise,” this does not mean that He does not have any names apart from these, rather it means that whoever learns these ninety-nine of His names will enter Paradise. This is like when the Arabs say: “I have one hundred horses which I have prepared for jihad for the sake of Allah,” which does not mean that the speaker has only these hundred horses, rather these hundred are prepared for this purpose.” (Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 1/122)

41006,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41006,A Christian Asking About Repentance,"If a man decides after a life of sinfulness to come to God and promise to reform his life, I understand that Islam says that he will be forgiven and therefore inherit the promises etc.
My question though is what has happened to the weight of this man's sin, as in sinning he has offended God and therefore this sin has to be atoned for; who is going to atone for his sin, if God is just going to forgive him on the promise of his being good and faithful? Surely as we saw with Adam there has to be a consequence for sin...",,,"Praise be to Allah.Who has guided us to Islam, for we would not have been guided had He not guided us. 
First of all, we thank you for your question, and we ask Allah to bless you with guidance. 
Allah has created us for a great purpose, which is to worship Him Alone with no partner or associate. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone)” [al-Dhaariyaat 51:56]
This is the purpose of life: to worship Allah alone. 
So Allah has not created us to eat and drink… or to relax and play… or to strive and work hard… rather He has created us to worship Him and not to be ungrateful to Him; to remember him and not forget Him.  
This is the purpose of life, and what a beautiful purpose it is. When man lives to worship his Lord and Master, to serve His religion and establish His command, with his body on earth and his heart with Allah and the Hereafter, then he understands the reality of this life and how insignificant this world is, and that what is left of this life should not be wasted in passing pleasures and temporary desires. O Allah, bless us with Your guidance.
Because worship requires explanation and guidance, Allah sent His Messengers: 
“Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the (coming of) Messengers” [al-Nisa’ 4:165]
Whoever submits is guided, and whoever turns away is doomed and lost. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, proofs have come to you from your Lord, so whosoever sees, will do so for (the good of) his ownself, and whosoever blinds himself, will do so to his own harm, and I (Muhammad) am not a watcher over you” [al-An’aam 6:104]
If a person submits (becomes Muslim), he has chosen happiness for himself: 
“And whosoever has embraced Islam (i.e. has become a Muslim by submitting to Allah), then such have sought the Right Path”
[al-Jinn 72:14 – interpretation of the meaning]
Because man is vulnerable to making mistakes and forgetting, and to falling into sin, Allah has prescribed repentance for His slaves and has opened the door of repentance until the Hour begins, and He invites His slaves to repent sincerely. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Turn to Allah with sincere repentance! It may be that your Lord will expiate from you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise)…” [al-Tahreem 66:8] 
“And all of you beg Allah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful” [al-Noor 24:31]
See also question no.  14289.
 It should be noted that sins are of two types: 
1 – Transgressions against the rights of Allah. 
2 – Transgressions against the rights of created beings. 
With regard to the first type: 
Transgressions against the rights of Allah – such as adultery, drinking alcohol, neglecting obligatory duties such as prayer, zakaah, etc. These sins are punishable according to sharee’ah, such as adultery and drinking, for which the hadd punishment is to be carried out on the one who does them, and that is an expiation and a purification for him. If the hadd punishment is not carried out on him, but he repents to Allah, then Allah will accept his repentance and turn his bad deeds (sayi’aat) into good deeds (hasanaat). 
Whoever meets Allah with these sins, without having repented or had the hadd punishment carried out on him, is subject to the will of Allah on the Day of Resurrection: if He wills He will punish him and if He wills He will forgive him. 
Al-Bukhari (18) and Muslim (1709) narrated from ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit (may Allah be pleased with him) – who was present at the Battle of Badr and was one of the prominent figures on the night of al-‘Aqabah – that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, when there was a group of his companions around him: “Give me your oath of allegiance (bay’ah), pledging that you will not associate anything with Allah, you will not steal, you will not commit adultery, you will not kill your children, you will not fabricate lies and you will not disobey with regard to anything that is right and proper. If you fulfil that, your reward will be with Allah, but whoever commits any of these actions, his punishment will be in this world and it will be an expiation for him. Whoever does any of these things then Allah conceals him, it will be up to Allah: if He wills He will forgive him and if He wills He will punish him.” So they gave their oath of allegiance to him on that basis. 
According to a report narrated by al-Bukhari (6416): “Whoever does any of these things will be punished in this world and that will be an expiation for him and a purification.” 
Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath (1/68): It is understood from this hadeeth that carrying out the hadd punishment is an expiation for sin, even if the person who is punished does not repent. This is the view of the majority of scholars… 
Ahmad (1365) narrated that ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever commits a sin in this world and is punished for it, Allah is too just to punish His slave a second time. Whoever commits a sin in this world then Allah conceals that and forgives him, Allah is too generous to go back to something that He has forgiven.” 
This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Arnaa’oot in Tahqeeq al-Musnad, and al-Haafiz classed a similar report from al-Tabaraani as hasan.  
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who invoke not any other ilaah (god) along with Allah, nor kill such person as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.
The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace;
Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Furqaan 25:68-70]
“Verily, Allah forgives not (the sin of) setting up partners (in worship) with Him, but He forgives whom He wills, sins other than that, and whoever sets up partners in worship with Allah, has indeed strayed far away.” [al-Nisa’ 4:116]
This verse has to do with the one who does not repent. He is subject to the will of Allah, unless he commits shirk (the sin of associating other with Allah), because shirk cannot be forgiven. 
With regard to the second type of sins:                                      
Transgressions against the rights of people, such as transgressing against their wealth by stealing it or seizing it by force, etc., or transgressing against their honour by means of gossip and slander, or harming them physically by striking them, etc. Repentance from this type of sin is subject to the condition that the rights be restored to the people, or they agree to forgive the offender. 
Whoever does not do that will remain subject to the effects of his sin until the Day of Resurrection, when an amount commensurate with his offence will be taken from his good deeds (hasanaat), as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever has wronged anyone with regard to his honour or anything else, let him settle the matter today before there is no dinar and no dirham, and if he has any righteous deeds, an amount commensurate with his wrongdoing will be taken from him, and if he has no good deeds (to his credit) some of the bad deeds of his companion will be taken and added to his burden.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2317. 
From this we know that the view that the sinner must be punished in this world is a view for which there is no evidence, but if a person is punished (in this world) that will be an expiation for him, and if he is not punished then he repents from his sin, Allah will accept his repentance. 
Even more false than this is the view of those who say that the punishment for sin may be borne by someone other than the sinner, as some ignorant people say concerning Adam (peace be upon him), claiming that his progeny – including the Prophets – bore the burden of his sin until God sent down His only son to be crucified and slain to free the world of sin! This is a lie and a fabrication against Allah and against His Prophets, and is a kind of injustice of which the divinely-revealed laws are free, because Allah does not punish anyone for the sins of another. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And no bearer of burdens shall bear another’s burden” [Faatir 35:18]
Allah is too merciful and too just to punish the offspring for the sins of their father, especially since he repented and Allah accepted his repentance. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Then the Shaytaan (Satan) made them slip therefrom (the Paradise), and got them out from that in which they were. We said: ‘Get you down, all, with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be a dwelling place for you and an enjoyment for a time.’
Then Adam received from his Lord Words. And his Lord pardoned him (accepted his repentance). Verily, He is the One Who forgives (accepts repentance), the Most Merciful” [al-Baqarah 2:36-37]
“Then they both ate of the tree, and so their private parts became manifest to them, and they began to cover themselves with the leaves of the Paradise for their covering. Thus did Adam disobey his Lord, so he went astray.
Then his Lord chose him, and turned to him with forgiveness, and gave him guidance” [Ta-Ha 20:121-122]
So two things apply in the case of Adam: he was punished for his sin, and he repented from it and Allah accepted his repentance, and He chose him and honoured him. 
The point is that whoever lives a life filled with disobedience and sin only has to turn to his Lord, the most Merciful and Most Generous, and seek His forgiveness and repent, in order for Allah to accept his repentance, as Allah has promised (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say: O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Zumar 39:53]
This is part of the kindness that Allah has made in this tolerant sharee’ah. It was decreed for the Children of Israel that the innocent among them kill the wrongdoers so that their repentance would be accepted [cf. al-Baqarah 2:54], then Allah lifted this heavy burden from this nation on whom He has had mercy.  
Finally we ask Allah to bless the questioner and guide him and open his heart to Islam, so that he may become a member of the Muslim ummah (nation) which accepts Allah as its Lord, Islam as its religion and Muhammad as its Prophet.

41017,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41017,Overstepping the mark in making du`a’?,"Some brothers are very detailed in their du`a, for example they say, “O Lord, give me a colour TV and a furnished apartment…” and so on. I am afraid that this is a kind of overstepping the mark in making du`a. If the person is the Haram in Makkah, especially during Ramadaan, is it not better for him to ask for what is good in this world and the next by reciting the du`as that are known from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? I came to your site looking for information on overstepping the mark in making du`a but I could not find a detailed answer. I hope that you can explain this matter. Thank you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.You should note – may Allah help us and you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him – that du`a is a weapon that has been forsaken by many people, but du`a is worship. 
It was narrated from al-Nu’maan ibn Basheer (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “ Du`a is worship.” Then he recited (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And your Lord said: Invoke Me [i.e. believe in My Oneness (Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your (invocation). Verily, those who scorn My worship [i.e. do not invoke Me, and do not believe in My Oneness, (Islamic Monotheism)] they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!” [Ghaafir 40:60].
Al-Albanisaid (it is) saheeh. See Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi, no. 2685. 
And it was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is nothing dearer to Allah than du`a.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaniin Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi, no. 2684. 
And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does not ask of Allah, He becomes angry with him.” Classed as hasan by al-Albani. See Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi, no. 2686. 
If you understand this, you should be keen to make a lot of du`a. 
Secondly: There is etiquette to be followed when making du`a and there are things which should be avoided, some of which we will sum up as follows: 
1-Starting with oneself when making du`a.
2-It is mustahabb to raise the hands when making du`a.
3-The person making du`a should be in a state of complete purity.
4-He should face the qiblah when making du`a.
5-He should manifest humility before Allah (“call upon Him in humility and in secret” [al-An’aam 6:63 – interpretation of the meaning]). In Badaa’i’ al-Fawaa’id Ibn al-Qayyim said that not being humble when making du`a is a kind of overstepping the mark in du`a. (Badaa’i’ al-Fawaa’id, 3/12).
6-He should beseech Allah in his du`a.
7-He should not look for a speedy response. In al-Saheehayn it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “You will be answered so long as you are not in a hurry and say, ‘I made du`a but I did not receive a response.’” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6340; Muslim, 2735. For when a Muslim calls upon his Lord, one of three things happens, as was mentioned in the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “There is no Muslim who calls upon his Lord with a du`a in which there is no sin or severing of family ties, but Allah will give him one of three things: Either He will answer his prayer quickly, or He will store (the reward for) it in the Hereafter, or He will divert an equivalent evil away from him.” They said: “We will say more du`a.” He said: “Allah’s bounty is greater.” Narrated by Ahmad, 10749; al-Tirmidhi, 3573. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaniin Mishkaat al-Masaabeeh, 2199.
8-It should be noted that one should praise and glorify Allah in du`a, and send blessing upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It was narrated that Faddaalah ibn ‘Ubayd said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) heard a man making du`a after his prayer, but he did not send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “This man is in a hurry.” Then he called him and said to him or to someone else: “When any one of you has finished praying (and makes du`a), let him start by praising Allah, then let him send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), then after that let him ask for whatever he wants.” Al-Albanisaid: it is a saheeh hadeeth. (See: Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 2765.
Thirdly: With regard to overstepping the mark in making du`a, this involves a number of things: 
1-Being too detailed in one's du`a, as described in the question (“O Allah, give me a furnished apartment and a colour TV etc”). Rather what is prescribed is to make du`a in concise words as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do. He used to ask Allah for the best in this world and in the Hereafter. It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mughaffal that he heard his son say: “O Allah, I ask You for the white palace on the right side of Paradise if I enter it.” He said: “O my son, ask Allah for Paradise and seek refuge with Allah from the Fire, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: ‘Among this ummah will be people who overstep the mark in purifying themselves and in making du`a.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 690; classed as saheeh by al-Albaniin Saheeh Abi Dawood.
2-Calling upon Allah in ways that Allah has forbidden or that are means that lead to something forbidden (because the means come under the same rulings as the ends). This was stated by Ibn al-Qayyim in Badaa’i’ al-Fawaa’id, 3/12. So whatever is a means to something haram is also haram.
Usually those who use televisions use them to watch and listen to haram things, so if the person who is praying for that is one of these people, then his du`a for this TV is a kind of overstepping the mark in making du`a, because he is asking Allah to give him something by means of which he will disobey Him. 
So it is clear that this du`a is overstepping the mark in two ways: 
1-Because it is detailed
2-Because it is a means to something haram, and the means come under the same rulings as the ends.
This applies if the person who is making the du`a is going to use it for something haram, as most people do.",Islam Q&A

	2 – Getting used to ignoring

3 – If you do not know anything about the person who is buying them, then the basic principle is that it is permissible.
It is not permissible to sell them if the vendor knows that the one who buys them is going to use them in ways that Allah has forbidden, because that is a kind of helping in sin and transgression.

    job. Her husband is obliged to spend on her on a reasonable basis, according 
    to what he can afford. See question no.

Secondly: 
If her work 
    is permissible, and she falls sick and going to work is too difficult for 
    her, or will delay her recovery or make her sicker, then the husband must 
    pay attention to that. It is not permissible for him to demand that his wife 
    do something that will cause her harm. 
The husband 
    must treat his wife in a kind and reasonable manner. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and live 
    with them honourably”
[al-Nisa’ 
    4:19]
It is not reasonable or 
    honourable to demand that the wife go to work when she is sick. 
The Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined the men of his 
    ummah to treat women well: “(I urge you) to treat women well.” (Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 3331; Muslim, 1468. 
What this 
    hadeeth means is: accept this advice and follow it: treat them kindly and 
    live with them honourably. 
Fath 
    al-Baari. 
The husband should not 
    doubt his wife’s sincerity; his life with her should be based on trust and 
    honesty, not suspicion and doubt. 
If the 
    husband is not convinced by the medical reports which prove that his wife is 
    sick, and he is not convinced by the signs of sickness that he sees in her, 
    then he will never be convinced by anything. So the wife should try (to 
    convince him) in a gentle manner and treat him in a way that is better; may 
    Allaah guide him to that which is best for his family.

41090,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41090,How purification from the najaasah of a dog is done,How is purification from the najaasah (impurity) of a dog done? Is it essential to wash seven times or is once enough?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Muslim (279) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The purification of the vessel of one of you, if a dog licks it, is to wash it seven times, the first time with soil.” 
And Muslim (280) narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Mughaffal said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If a dog licks the vessel of one of you, let him wash it seven times and rub it with soil the eighth time.” 
In these two ahaadeeth the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained how purification from the najaasah of a dog is to be done, which is by washing the vessel seven times, one of which should be with soil. Both are required. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (1/73): 
There is no difference of scholarly opinion concerning the fact that the najaasah of a dog must be washed seven times, one of which should be with soil. This is the view of al-Shaafa’i. End quote. 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (2/598): 
The scholars differed concerning the licking of a dog. Our view is that it makes whatever it licked naajis (impure), and the vessel must be washed seven times, one of which must be with soil. This is the view of the majority of scholars. Ibn al-Mundhir narrated the view that it is obligatory to wash it seven times from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn ‘Abbaas, ‘Urwah ibn al-Zubayr, Tawoos, ‘Amr ibn Dinar, Maalik, al-Awzaa’i, Ahmad, Ishaaq, Abu ‘Ubayd and Abu Thawr. Ibn al-Mundhir said: This is also my opinion. End quote. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
If the najaasah is somewhere other than on the ground and it is the najaasah of a dog, then it must be purified by washing it seven times, one of which must be with soil. End quote. 
Majmoo’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (11/245). 
It is better if the first washing is the one that is done with soil, but if it is done otherwise that still achieves the purpose and purifies the place. 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (2/598): 
It is mustahabb to use the soil in the first washing, and if that is not done then it is better to do it in any other time other than the seventh. But if it is done in the seventh it is permissible. It says in the reports in the Saheeh: “seven times” and “seven times, the first time with soil”; in one report it says “the last time” instead of “the first time.” In other reports it says, “seven times, the seventh with soil” and “seven times and the eighth time sprinkle it with soil.” Al-Bayhaqi and others narrated all these reports, which indicates that it is not essential that it be done the first time, rather that it be done one of those times. End quote. 
Washing with soil may be done in several ways: 
1-Washing with water then sprinkling soil on it
2-Sprinkling soil on it and following it with water
3-Mixing soil with water and washing the vessel with it.
This was stated by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen in Sharh Buloogh al-Maraam, hadeeth no. 14.",Islam Q&A
41098,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41098,Ruling on selling metals which are in the stores of the company that is keeping them,"What is the ruling on buying and selling metals in the following fashion: 

The company which owns the metals stores them with one of the companies that specializes in that, and a lease or contract is written up to that effect. Then when a person, company or bank comes to buy the metals from the company that owns them, they pay for them but the metals remain with the storage company as they are, and all that happens is that the contract is transferred to the purchaser’s name. Is this regarded as acquisition and taking possession?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      It is proven that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
      Allaah be upon him) forbade selling a product in the place where it had 
      been bought until the traders moved it to their own place. Narrated by Abu 
      Dawood, 3499; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 

    And it was proven that he  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said to Hakeem ibn Hizaam: “Do not sell that which is not in 
    your possession.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1232; classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
The scholars (may Allaah 
    have mercy on them) stated that what is meant by taking possession varies 
    according to the object sold. Taking possession of gold and silver, for 
    example, is different from taking possession of land and real estate. There 
    is a difference in taking possession between that which can be moved and 
    that which cannot. 

    It seems that it is difficult to move these metals from one 
    place to another, because the amount is very large and requires trucks, 
    stores, and cranes, etc. 

    So there is a real need for them to remain with the storage company. Hence I think there is no reason why they cannot be sold in the manner described, and it is sufficient to transfer the contract to the name of the purchaser. And Allaah knows best.",Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Barraak
