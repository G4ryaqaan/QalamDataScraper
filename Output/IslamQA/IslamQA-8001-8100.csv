Can you miss prayer or delay it if you are unable to do Istinja’?","Praise be to Allah.When a person relieves himself, he must cleanse himself of impurities either with water – which is best and most perfect – or with something other than water which will remove the impurities, such as toilet paper, fabric, stones or something else. 
In Islam, How Does One Clean Himself After Using The Toilet?
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
When a person relieves himself, he must do one of the following three things: 

Purify himself with water: This is permissible and the evidence for it is the Hadith of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to relieve himself , then another boy and I would bring a vessel of water and a short spear [to use as a Sutrah for the prayer he was going to do after doing Wudu] and he would cleanse himself with the water.”  (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 149; Muslim, 271) 

The reason for this is that the basic way of removing impurities is to use water. Just as you use water to remove any impurities from your foot, so too you use it to remove any impurities resulting from relieving yourself.  

Purify himself using stones: Doing Istijmar (using stones to cleanse oneself after relieving oneself) is sufficient. This is indicated by the words and actions of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). With regard to his words, Salman (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade us to use less than three stones for the purpose of Istijmar.” (Narrated by Muslim,  262) 

With regard to his actions, Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went out to answer the call of nature and asked me to bring him three stones. I found two stones and searched for a third but could not find one. So I took a piece of dried dung and brought it to him. He took the two stones and threw away the dung and said, ‘This is a filthy thing.’” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 122) 
The Hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), which states that he gathered some stones for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and brought them to him in his garment, put them down next to him, and then went away (narrated by Al-Bukhari, 154) indicates that Istijmar is permissible.

Purify himself with stones then with water: I do not know of any report to this effect from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but there is no doubt that this is more effective in cleaning.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 1/103-105) 

Can you miss prayer or delay it if you are unable to do Istinja’?
Based on the above, you have no excuse for not praying or for delaying the prayer beyond the appointed time because you are unable to do Istinja’ (wash with water after relieving yourself), since you can remove the impurity and cleanse yourself of it using tissues and the like. 
Everyone can carry some tissues with him in his pocket to clean himself with. Moreover, it is not clear from the question what is stopping you from cleaning yourself with water after relieving yourself, especially since you say, “Should I make Wudu and pray or miss the prayer?”  What that means is that water is available, so you can bring some water to the toilet and use it to clean yourself. If you do not do that then you have to remove the impurity using tissues and the like, do Wudu, and then pray. It is not permissible for you to delay the prayer until its time has passed.

8015,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8015,Can a Muslim Marry a Hindu?,I have a Muslim friend who is in love with a Hindu girl. His family being Orthodox won’t accept this. Would it be a sin if I help my friend in getting married with that girl?,It is not permissible for a Muslim man to marry a Hindu woman and it is not permissible for you to help your friend to marry this Hindu girl.,"Can a Muslim man marry a non-Muslim woman?


Can a Muslim Marry a Hindu?","Praise be to Allah.Can a Muslim man marry a non-Muslim woman?
It is not permissible for a Muslim to marry any non-Muslim woman unless she is one of the People of the Book , i.e., a Jewish or Christian woman. If he does that then his marriage is invalid; that is adultery, not marriage; and he is a sinner who is committing a major sin. 
The evidence for that is the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Made lawful to you this day are At-Tayyibat [all kinds of Halal (lawful) foods, which Allah has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]. The food (slaughtered cattle, eatable animals) of the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them. (Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time when you have given their due Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage), desiring chastity (i.e. taking them in legal wedlock) not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends.” [al-Maidah 5:5]
So Allah has permitted the believing men to marry chaste believing women and chaste women from among the People of the Book. 
Imam al-Tabari said, commenting on this verse: 
“…and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time” this means free woman from among those who were given the Scripture, i.e., the Jews and Christians who follow the Tawrat (Torah) and Injil (Gospel). “Before your time” O believers in Muhammad from among the Arabs and all of mankind. You may marry them also “when you have given their due Mahr” i.e., when you give the mahr or dowry to those whom you marry from among your (Muslim) chaste women or their chaste women.” (Tafsir al-Tabari, 6/104)
Can a Muslim Marry a Hindu?
It is not permissible for a Muslim man to marry a Magian (Zoroastrian), Hindu, communist or idol-worshipping woman, etc. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And do not marry Al-Mushrikat (idolatresses) till they believe (worship Allah Alone). And indeed a slave woman who believes is better than a (free) Mushrikah (idolatress), even though she pleases you…” [Al-Baqarah 2:221]
Based on this, it is not permissible for you to help him to disobey Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression.” [al-Maidah 5:2]
You should advise him to call her to Islam and explain to her that Allah has forbidden him to marry her unless she becomes Muslim. If she becomes Muslim, then he can marry her, but if she insists on continuing to follow her religion, then he should fear Allah and not marry her, and he should be patient in doing so; then Allah will compensate him with something better, for “Whoever gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with something better.” 
We ask Allah to guide us to the straight path and to keep us from slipping.

          dog out of the house and not keep it inside, unless it is for one of 
          three reasons, namely hunting, farming or herding livestock. The Prophet 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) said: “Whoever keeps a dog, unless it is a dog for hunting, 
          herding or farming, his reward will decrease by two qiraats (i.e., a

8034,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8034,The meaning of “The bonds of Islam will be undone one by one”,"The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “The bonds of Islam will be undone one by one. Each time one bond is undone, the people will move to the next one (and adhere to that). The first bond to be undone will be ruling (al-hukm) and the last one will be prayer (al-salaah).” 
What does this hadeeth mean? And what is meant by the undoing of ruling (al-hukm)?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The hadeeth mentioned was narrated by Imaam Ahmad in his 
          Musnad, al-Tabaraani in 
          al-Mu’jam al-Kabeer, and 
          Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh, 
          with a jayyid isnaad from Abu Umaamah al-Baahili (may Allaah be pleased 
          with him) from the Prophet  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who said: 
“The bonds of Islam will be undone one by one. Each time one bond 
          is undone, the people will move to the next one (and adhere to that). 
          The first bond to be undone will be ruling (al-hukm) 
          and the last one will be prayer (al-salaah).” 
            
The meaning of this hadeeth is apparent, which is that 
          the more Islam becomes “strange”, the more people will go against its 
          teachings and will undo its bonds, which is a reference to its obligations 
          and commandments. As the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Islam began as a 
          stranger and will go back to being a stranger as it started, so give 
          glad tidings to the strangers.” (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh). 
          
 The meaning of the phrase “the first bond to be undone 
          will be ruling (al-hukm)” 
          is apparent; it refers to the failure to rule according to the sharee’ah 
          of Allaah. This is what is happening today in most of the so-called 
          Muslim countries. It is known that what is obligatory upon all is to 
          rule according to the sharee’ah of Allaah in all things, and to beware 
          of ruling according to laws and customs which go against the sharee’ah, 
          because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“But no, by your Lord, they can 
          have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes 
          between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, 
          and accept (them) with full submission [al-Nisaa’ 4:65]   
          
“And so judge 
          (you O Muhammad) among them by what Allaah has revealed and follow not 
          their vain desires, but beware of them lest they turn you (O Muhammad) 
          far away from some of that which Allaah has sent down to you. And if 
          they turn away, then know 
          that Allaah’s Will is to punish them for some sins of theirs. And truly, 
          most of men are Faasiqoon (rebellious and disobedient to Allaah). 
Do they then seek the judgement 
          of (the days of) Ignorance? And who is better in judgement than Allaah 
          for a people who have firm Faith [al-Maa’idah 5:49-50] 
          
“And whosoever 
          does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, such are the Kaafiroon (i.e. 
          disbelievers — of a lesser degree as they do not act on Allaah’s Laws 
          [al-Maa’idah 5:44] 
 “And 
          whosoever does not judge by that which Allaah has revealed, such are 
          the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers — of a lesser degree). [al-Maa’idah 
          5:45] 
 “And 
          whosoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed (then) such (people) 
          are the Faasiqoon [the rebellious i.e. disobedient (of a lesser degree)] 
          to Allaah [al-Maa’idah 5:47] 
 The scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) explained 
          that the rulers of the Muslims are obliged to rule according to the 
          sharee’ah of Allaah in all the Muslims’ affairs and in all the conflicts 
          that arise among them, in obedience to these verses. They explained 
          that the one who rules by anything other than that which Allaah revealed, 
          if he believes that it is permissible for him to do so, is guilty of 
          major kufr which puts him beyond the pale of Islam… But if he believes 
          that this is not permissible, but he rules by something other than that 
          which Allaah revealed for a bribe or for some other purpose, although 
          he believed that that is not permissible, and that it is obligatory 
          to rule according to that which Allaah revealed, then he is guilty of 
          lesser kufr, lesser zulm and lesser fisq. 
 We ask Allaah, may He be glorified, to make all the 
          Muslim rulers rule and judge according to the sharee’ah and to make 
          their people adhere to it, and to cause them to beware of whatever goes 
          against it, for He is the Most Generous, Most Kind. Undoubtedly ruling 
          according to sharee’ah and acting in accordance with it is in our best 
          interests in this world and in the Hereafter, and will be a source of 
          pride in this world and in the Hereafter. It will keep us safe from 
          the plots of our enemies and help us to be victorious over them, as 
          Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): 
 “O you who believe! 
          If you help (in the cause of) Allaah, He will help you, and make your 
          foothold firm” [Muhammad 47:7] 
 “and 
          (as for) the believers, it was incumbent upon Us to help (them)” [al-Room 
          30:47] 
 “Verily, Allaah 
          will help those who help His (Cause). Truly, Allaah is All-Strong, 
          All-Mighty. 
Those (Muslim rulers) who, if 
          We give them power in the land, (they) enjoin Iqaamat-as-Salaah

          (the males in mosques)], to pay the Zakaah and they enjoin Al-Ma‘roof 
          (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and forbid 
          Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism and all that Islam has forbidden) 
          [i.e. they make the Qur’aan as the law of their country in all the spheres 
          of life]. And with Allaah rests the end of (all) matters (of creatures) 
          [al-Hajj 22:40-41] 
 “Verily, We will indeed make victorious Our Messengers 
          and those who believe (in the Oneness of Allaah  Islamic Monotheism) 
          in this world’s life and on the Day when the witnesses will stand forth, 
          (i.e. Day of Resurrection) 
The Day when their excuses will 
          be of no profit to Zaalimoon (polytheists, wrongdoers and disbelievers 
          in the Oneness of Allaah). Theirs will be the curse, and theirs will 
          be the evil abode (i.e. painful torment in Hell-fire)” [Ghaafir 
          40:51-52]

With regard to the words of the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “and the last one will 
          be prayer (al-salaah)”, 
          this refers to large numbers of people who do not pray and who are negligent 
          with regard to salaah. This is what is happening today in many Muslim 
          countries. We ask Allaah to put the Muslims’ affairs right and to help

That she will be with the one who was best in character and conduct with
        her in this world;

That she will choose between them;

That she will be with the last of her husbands.

The best and most correct of these views is the third one, concerning
    which there is a hadeeth attributed to the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him) (marfoo’): “Any woman whose husband dies and she marries someone else after
    him, she will be with the last of her husbands.” This was classed as saheeh by
    Al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) in Saheeh Al-Jaami’, 2704, and in Al-Silsilah
    al-Saheehah, 1281.
This is by way of general response to the question. A detailed
    discussion of the evidence for the three points of view follows:
The evidence for the first view:
Al-Qurtubi said:
Abu Bakr ibn al-Najjaad said: Ja’far ibn Muhammad ibn Shaakir told
    us, ‘Ubayd ibn Ishaaq al-‘Attaar told us, Sinaan ibn Haaroon told us, from
    Humayd from Anas: that Umm Habeebah the wife of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) said: “O Messenger of Allaah, if a woman had two husbands in this
    life, then they all died and came together in Paradise, with which of them would she be
    – the first or the last?” He said: “With the one whose attitude and conduct
    with her was best, O Umm Habeebah; a good attitude brings one the best of this world and
    the Hereafter.”
(Al-Tadhkirah fi Ahwaal al-Mawtaa wa’l-Aakhirah, 2/278).
I say: this hadeeth is da’eef jiddan (very weak), and has
    two things wrong with its isnaad: ‘Ubayd ibn Ishaaq al-‘Attaar and Sinaan ibn
    Haaroon. The former is da’eef jiddan, and the latter is da’eef.
The views of the ‘ulamaa’:
It was reported that Yahyaa ibn Ma’een said: ‘Ubayd ibn
    Ishaaq al-‘Attaar is nothing (i.e., what he says is not to be taken into account).
Abu Haatim al-Raazi said: we think that he is a good person, but he is
    not very reliable and there are some odd things in his ahaadeeth.

    (p.72), it says: his hadeeth is matrook (to be ignored, not accepted).
Al-Dhahabi said: he was classed as da’eef (weak) by Yahyaa.
    Al-Bukhaari said: he has some some munkar ahaadeeth. Al-Azdi said: his hadeeth is matrook.
    Al-Daaraqutni said: (he is) da’eef. Abu Haatim, on the other hand, accepted
    him! Ibn ‘Udayy said: in general his ahadeeth are munkar.
(Meezaan al-I’tidaal, 5/24)
Ibn ‘Udayy said in al-Kaamil (5/347): this hadeeth is one
    of his munkar reports. And he said: most of what he reported is either munkar
    with regard to the isnaad (chain of narrators) or munkar with regard to the matn
    (text of the hadeeth).
With regard to Sinaan ibn Haaroon:
Ibn Hibbaan said:
His ahaadeeth are very munkar, he narrated munkar
    reports from al-mashaaheer.
Yahyaa ibn Ma’een said: the hadeeth of Sinaan ibn Haaroon
    al-Burjami are nothing (are not to be accepted).
(Al-Majrooheen, 1/354)
al-‘Aqeeli mentioned him in al-Du’afaa’ (2/171)
    and mentioned this hadeeth narrated by him.
= Therefore, this hadeeth is not valid to be used as evidence. It is da’eef
    jiddan (very weak), so this opinion does not count.
The second view
which is that a woman will choose between her husbands.

I could not find any evidence for those who state this.
In al-Tadhkirah fi Ahwaal al-Mawtaa wa’l-Aakhirah (2/278),
    this matter is mentioned, then the author says: and it is said that she will have the
    choice, if she had a husband.”
Al-‘Ajlooni said: … and it was said that she will be with the
    best of them in character and conduct, and it was said that she will have the choice. (Kashf
    al-Khafaa’, 2/392).
This is the view regarded as most correct by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen
    (may Allaah preserve him), as stated in his Fataawaa, 2/53)
The third view
This view is supported by plenty of evidence:
Imaam al-Tabaraani said:

3130 Bakr told us, he said, Muhammad ibn Abi’l-Sirri
      al-‘Asqallaani told us, he said, al-Waleed ibn Muslim told us, he said, Abu Bakr ibn
      ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Abi Maryam told us, from ‘Atiyah ibn Qays al-Kilaa’i who
      said: Mu’aawiyah ibn Abi Sufyaan proposed marriage to Umm al-Darda’ after
      Abu’l-Darda’ had passed away. Umm al-Darda’ said: I heard
      Abu’l-Darda’ say: I heard the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of
      Allaah be upon him) say: any woman whose husband dies and she marries someone else after
      him, she will be with the last of her husbands, and I would not choose you over
      Abu’l-Darda’. So Mu’aawiyah wrote to her (saying), you have to fast, for it
      is a protection.
(al-Mu’jam al-Awsat, 3/275)
I say: there are two problems with this hadeeth: the fact that Abu Bakr
      ibn Abi Maryam is da’eef, and the fact that al-Waleed ibn Muslim did not
      clearly state haddathanaa ([So and so] told us) in the rest of the isnaad.
The views of the ‘ulamaa’:
Ibn Hibbaan said:
Abu Bakr ibn Abi Maryam was one of the best of the people of al-Shaam,
      but he had a bad memory and would narrate things about which he was obviously confused.
      The problem is not so bad that everything he narrated deserves to be rejected (matrook),
      but neither is he so trustworthy that what he says can be taken as evidence. In my view
      his reports should not be used as evidence if the isnaad is only through him. (al-Majrooheen,
      3/146)
The tadlees (deception) of al-Waleed ibn Muslim is well known.
      His tadlees gives the impression that all the narrators are equal, by inserting the
      name of a da’eef narrator between the names of two thiqah (trustworthy)
      narrators. Hence the scholars stipulated that the reports of narrators of this type can
      only be accepted if they clearly state “haddathanaa” ([So and so] told
      us) in every stage of the isnaad after their name is mentioned.
(See: al-Tabyeen li Asmaa’ al-Mudalliseen, by Sabt Ibn
      al-‘Ajami, p. 235; and Tabaqaat al-Mudalliseen, by al-Haafiz ibn Hajar, p. 51)
Imaam Abu’l-Shaykh al-Asbahaani said:
Ahmad ibn Ishaaq al-Jawhari told us, he said, Ismaa’eel ibn
      Zaraarah told us, he said, Abu’l-Maleeh al-Raqqi told us from Maymoon ibn Mahraan
      from Umm al-Darda’ from Abu’l-Darda’ that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings
      of Allaah be upon him) said that a woman will be with the last of her husbands.
(Tabaqaat al-Muhaaditheen bi Asbahaan, 4/36)
I say, the men of the hadeeth (isnaad) are thiqaat mashhooroon
      (trustworthy and well known), apart from Ahmad ibn Ishaaq al-Jawhari, for whom I cannot
      find any biographical details apart from the fact that Abu’l-Shaykh himself stated
      that this was one of his hasan ahaadeeth.
If this is indeed the case, then this is the best isnaad
      concerning this matter. And Allaah knows best.
Al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadi said:
4803 Samurah ibn Hajar Abu Hajar al-Khurasaani went and settled in
      Al-Anbaar, where he narrated from Hamzah ibn Abi Hamzah al-Nusaibi and ‘Ammaar ibn
      ‘Ata’ al-Khurasaani and al-Rabee’ ibn Badr; Ishaaq ibn Bahlool al-Tanookhi
      narrated from him, he informed us, ‘Ali ibn Abi ‘Ali told us, Abu Ghaanim
      Muhammad ibn Yoosuf al-Azraq told us, my father told us, he said, my grandfather told us,
      Samurah ibn Hajar Abu Hajar al-Khurasaani told us from Hamzah al-Nusaibi from ibn Abi
      Maleekah from ‘Aa’ishah that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
      him) said:
“A woman will be with the last of her husbands.”
(Taareekh Baghdaad, 9/228)
I said, this hadeeth is da’eef jiddan (very weak); it
      includes Hamzah al-Nusaibi, who is da’eef jiddan.
The views of the ‘ulamaa’:
Imaam al-Nasaa’i said:
The hadeeth (of Hamzah ibn al-Nusaibi) is to be rejected (matrook).
(al-Du’afaa’ wa’l-Matrookeen, p. 39)
Ibn al-Jawzi said:
Ahmad said: the hadeeth (of Hamzah ibn al-Nusaibi) is to be rejected (matrooh).
      Yahyaa said: he is nothing, he is not even worth a penny. Al-Bukhaari and al-Raazi said:
      his hadeeth is munkar. Al-Nasaa’i and al-Daaraqutni said: the hadeeth (of
      Hamzah ibn al-Nusaibi) is to be rejected (matrook). Ibn ‘Udayy said: he
      fabricates ahaadeeth. Ibn Hibbaan said: he is the only thiqah (trustworthy) narrator who
      transmitted fabricated ahaadeeth and it looks as if he is deliberately narrating them; it
      is not permissible to report from him.
(al-Du’afaa’ wa’l-Matrookeen by Ibn al-Jawzi, 1/237)
Al-Bayhaqi said:
Muhammad ibn ‘Abd-Allaah al-Haafiz informed us,
      Abu’l-‘Abbaas Muhammad ibn Ya’qoob told us, Yahyaa ibn Abi Taalib told us,
      Ishaaq ibn Abi Taalib told us, Ishaaq ibn Mansoor told us, ‘Eesaa ibn ‘Abd
      al-Rahmaan al-Sulami told us, from Abu Ishaaq from Silah from Hudhayfah (may Allaah be
      pleased with him), that he said to his wife, “If you want to be my wife in Paradise,
      do not marry anyone after I die, for in Paradise a woman will be with the last of her
      husbands in this world. This is why Allaah forbade the wives of the Prophet 
 (peace and
      blessings of Allaah be upon him) to marry anyone after he died, because they will be his
      wives in Paradise.” (al-Sunan, 7/69)
I say: the isnaad includes Abu Ishaaq al-Subay’i, who is mudallis
      and may mix things up, so the report is da’eef.
The views of the ‘ulamaa’:
See: Man rumiya bi’l-Ikhtilaat by al-Taraabulsi (p. 64) and
      Tabaqaat al-Mudalliseen by Ibn Hajar (p. 42).
It was classed as da’eef by al-‘Allaamah al-Shaykh
      al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (1281).
A report narrated by Ibn ‘Asaakir (19/193/1) from ‘Ikrimah:
Asmaa’ bint Abi Bakr was married to al-Zubayr ibn al-‘Awwaam,
    who was strict with her. She came to her father and complained to him about that, and he
    said: O my daughter, have patience, for if a woman has a righteous husband, then he dies,
    and she does not marry anyone after him, they will be joined together in Paradise.
Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:
The men of this report are thiqaat (trustworthy), but there is Irsaal
    ( a break in the chain), because ‘Ikrimah never met Abu Bakr, but he may have heard
    this report from Asmaa’ bint Abi Bakr. And Allaah knows best.
Al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 3/276.
Conclusion
The view that a woman will be with the husband who was best in
    character and conduct with her in this world has no saheeh evidence to support it.
The view that a woman will have the choice of whichever husband she
    wishes to be with has no evidence to support it at all.
The view that she will be with the last of her husbands is the view
    that is most likely to be correct, because the hadeeth of Umm al-Dardaa’ is likely to
    be hasan and marfoo’ (attributed to the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings
    of Allaah be upon him)). It is supported by the reports of Hudhayfah and Asmaa’ which
    are mawqoof (their isnaads stop at the Sahaabi and are not directly attributed to
    the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)). They are fit to be taken as a
    corroboration of the marfoo’ report and as proof that there is a reasonable basis for
    this view.
The hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-‘Allaamah Shaykh
    al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (1281).
In any case, we prefer it to mere opinion.
And Allaah knows best.
O Allaah, bestow Your blessings and peace upon Muhammad and his family
    and companions.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
