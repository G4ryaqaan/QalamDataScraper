11107,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11107,Is it better for one who is sick not to fast in Ramadaan?,"Is it better for a sick person not to fast, or to put up with the difficulties and fast?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If fasting will be too difficult for the one who is sick, it is better for him not to fast, and to make up the days that he did not fast later on. It is not mustahabb for him to fast if it is too difficult. 
The evidence for that is as follows: 
1 – Ahmad (5832) narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: The Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah loves His concessions to be accepted just as He hates for acts of disobedience to be committed.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 564. 
2 – al-Bukhaari (6786) and Muslim (2327) narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was never given the choice between two things but he would choose the easier of them, unless it was a sin. If it was a sin he would be the furthest away from it. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
This shows that it is mustahabb to choose the easier and gentler option, so long as it is not haraam or makrooh. 
Rather it is makrooh for one who is sick to fast if fasting is too difficult for him. His fasting may be haraam if there is the fear that he may be harmed because of fasting. 
Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: (2/276): 
In the case of one who is sick, two scenarios may apply: 
1 – He is not able to fast at all, so he has to break his fast and it is obligatory for him not to fast. 
2 – If he is able to fast but that will cause him harm and be difficult for him. In this case it is mustahabb for him to break his fast and not to fast; in this case only an ignorant person would fast. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni, 4/404: 
If a sick person is able to put up with fasting and does so, then he has done something which is makrooh, because of the harm that results from that and because he has neglected the concession granted by Allaah. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (6/352): 
From this we realize the mistake made by the mujaahideen and sick people for whom fasting is difficult and may even cause them harm, but they refuse to break the fast. We said that they are making a mistake when they do not accept the kindness of Allaah and the concession He has granted, and they are harming themselves. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And do not kill yourselves”

3.	The punishments vary according to the sins committed. Please see the answer below for details.","What is al-Barzakh?


Punishment in al-Barzakh","Praise be to Allah.What is al-Barzakh?
What is meant by al-barzakh is the period between a person's death and his resurrection on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever dies as a Muslim, obeying Allaah, will be in a blessed state , and whoever dies as a kafir, disobeying Allaah, will be punished. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning);
“The Fire, they are exposed to it, morning and afternoon. And on the Day when the Hour will be established (it will be said to the angels): ‘Cause Fir‘aun’s (Pharaoh) people to enter the severest torment!’” [Ghafir 40:46]
Punishment in al-Barzakh
The punishments vary according to the sins committed. A hadeeth was narrated in Saheeh al-Bukhari which describes the torments of al-barzakh which will befall some of those who committed major sins. 
Samurah ibn Jundub (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) often used to ask his Companions, ‘Did any one of you see a dream?’ So dreams would be described to him by those who Allah willed should speak. One morning, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“Last night, two people came to me (in a dream), and woke me up and said, ‘Let’s go!’ I set out with them, and we came across a man who was lying down, with another man standing over him, holding a big rock. He threw the rock at the man's head, smashing it. 
The rock rolled away, and the one who had thrown it followed it, and picked it up. By the time he came back to the man, his head had been restored to its former state. Then he (the one who had thrown the rock) did the same as he had done before. I said to my two companions, ‘Subhan Allah! Who are these two persons?’ They said, ‘Move on!’ So we went on, and came to a man who was lying flat on his back, with another man standing over him, holding an iron hook. He put the hook in the man's mouth and tore off that side of his face to the back (of his neck), and he tore his nose and his eye from front to back in a similar manner. Then he turned to the other side of the man's face and did likewise. No sooner had he finished the second side but the first side was restored to its former state, then he went back and did the same thing again. I said to my two companions, ‘Subhan Allah! Who are these two persons?’ 
They said, ‘Move on!’ So we went on, and came to something like a tannoor (a kind of oven, lined with clay, usually used for baking bread).  – I think the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, in that oven there was much noise and voices. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) added:  - We  looked into it and saw naked men and  women. A flame of fire was reaching them from underneath, and when it reached them, they cried out loudly. I asked them, ‘Who are these?’ They said to me,  ‘Move on!’ So we went on and came to a river – I think he said, red like blood. – In the river there was a man swimming, and on the bank there was a man who had gathered many stones. Whilst the swimmer was swimming, the man who had gathered the stones approached him. The swimmer opened his mouth and the man on the bank threw a stone into it, then the swimmer carried on swimming. 
Each time he came back, he opened his mouth again, and the man on the bank threw another stone into his mouth. I said to my two companions, ‘Who are these two persons?’ They said, ‘Move on, move on!’ We went on and came to a man who had the most repulsive appearance imaginable. Beside him there was a fire, which he was kindling, and he was running around it. I asked my companions, ‘Who is this man?’ They said, ‘Move on, move on!’ So we went on until we reached a garden of deep green dense vegetation, with all kinds of spring colours. In the midst of this garden was a very tall man, whose head I could hardly see because of his great height. Around him there were children, a great number such as I have never seen. I said to my companions, ‘who is this man, and who are these children?’ 
They said, ‘Move on, move on!’ So we went on, until we came to a huge garden, bigger and better than any I have ever seen. My two companions said to me, ‘Go up.’ So we went up into it, until we reached a city built of gold and silver bricks. We went to the gate and asked for it to be opened. It was opened and we entered the city, where we found men with one side of their bodies more handsome than the most handsome person you have ever seen, and the other side uglier than the ugliest person you have ever seen. My two companions ordered those men to throw themselves into the river. There was a river flowing through the city, and its water was pure white. The men went and threw themselves in the river, and came out with the ugliness in their bodies gone, and they were in the best shape. (My two companions) said to me, ‘This is the Paradise of ‘Aden (the Garden of Eden), and that is your place.’ I looked up and saw a palace like a white cloud. They said to me, ‘That is your place.’ I said to them, ‘May Allah bless you both, let me enter it.’ 
They said, ‘For now you will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day).’ I said to them, I have seen many wonders this night. What do all these things mean that I have seen?’ They said: ‘We will tell you. The first man you came across, whose head was being smashed with the rock, is the man who studies the Quran then he neither recites it nor acts upon it, and he goes to sleep, neglecting the obligatory prayers. The man you came across whose mouth, nose and ears were being torn from front to back, is the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells a lie that is so serious that it spreads all over the world. The naked men and women whom you saw in a structure that resembled an oven are the adulterers and adulteresses. The man you saw swimming in the river with rocks being thrown into his mouth is the one who consumed riba (usury). 
The ugly-looking man whom you saw kindling a fire and walking around it was Malik, the keeper of Hell. The tall man whom you saw in the garden was Ibraheem, and the children around him were the children who died (young) in a state of fitrah (natural state of mankind, i.e., Islam).’ – Some of the Muslims asked, ‘O Messenger of Allah, what about the children of the mushrikeen?’ He said, ‘And the children of the mushrikeen too.’ – ‘As for the men who were half handsome and half ugly, they were people who had mixed a good deed with another deed that was bad, but Allah forgave them.’”  (Narrated by Muslim, no. 7047)

          smoking, or pray for himself to be cursed. Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning): 
“They swear by Allaah their strongest oaths, that if only you 
          would order them, they would leave (their homes for fighting in Allaah’s 
          Cause). Say: 
          ‘Swear you not; (this) obedience (of yours) is known (to be false). Verily, 
          Allaah knows well what you do.’” [al-Noor 24:53] 
Question: But this [aayah] 
          has to do with the munaafiqeen (hypocrites), and our friend is sincere.
  Answer: This [ayah] is general [in meaning]. Every person who 
          wants to worship Allaah should not swear an oath concerning his worship; 
          let him strive of his own free will, not under compulsion. 
  Question: so this way is wrong and he will be sinning if he does 
          it? 
  Answer: No, what is denounceable is the fact that he is trying 
          to confirm something through this oath. 
  Question: So we can say that this is an action which is not prescribed 
          in Islam? 
Answer: Yes, undoubtedly. And Allaah knows best.",Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen

Now the woman is pregnant. I would like to know if I can marry her in order to solve the problem (I mean cover the scandal) so the baby will find a father and gets the name. Actually, unfortunately, I would prefer abortion and I wish to convince her to do that, but don't know if this is considered killing a person. If so, I would feel guilty because of that. I believe the embryo is about 6-8 weeks. Please, I need your help as soon as possible.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly, my brother in Islam, I offer you my condolences for the faith that you lost during the times when you were committing adultery. For the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When an adulterer commits illegal sexual intercourse, then he is not a believer at the time he is doing it, and when a drinker of an alcoholic liquor drinks it, then he is not a believer at the time of drinking it, and when a thief steals, then he is not a believer at the time of stealing, and when a robber robs, and the people look at him, then he is not a believer at the time of doing robbery.” (al-Bukhari) 
Have you not read what your Lord says in His Book? 
“And come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a Fahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits: a great sin, and an evil way that leads one to Hell unless Allah forgives him).” [17:32 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Do you not know that Allah sees you wherever you are, and He hears you when you speak? 
Do you not remember the great blessings that Allah has bestowed upon you? For He is the One Who heals you when you are sick, the One Who feeds you when you are hungry and gives you to drink when you are thirsty. And He has given you the greatest blessing that He has bestowed upon mankind, the blessing of Islam.
“Is there any reward for good – other than good?” [55:60 – interpretation of the meaning] 
My brother, ask yourself: Whose dominion do you live under? Whose provision do you eat from? By Whose command do you live? Is it not the dominion of Allah, the provision of Allah, the command of Allah? So how can you disobey Allah? 
Perhaps you have forgotten the hadeeth (narration) of the Mi’raj (ascension), in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“… then we proceeded and came to something like a tannoor (a kind of oven).” [The narrator] said: “I think he said, ‘in which there were clamouring voices.’” He [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] said: “We looked into it and there we saw naked men and women. Flames were coming to them from the bottom of it, and when the flames reached them, they made an uproar. I said to them [i.e., the two angels who were accompanying him], ‘Who are these?’ They said, ‘Proceed, proceed!’… I said to them, ‘I have seen strange things this night. What is this that I have seen?’ They said, ‘We will tell you…. The naked men and women in the structure that resembled a tannoor oven are the adulterers and adulteresses.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari). 
So you must hasten to repent sincerely before death overtakes you, for the gate of repentance is open until the sun rises from the west or before the soul reaches the throat [at death]. Allah rejoices over the repentance of His slave, and He will change his bad deeds (sayyiat) into good deeds (hasanat). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who invoke not any other ilah (god) along with Allah, nor kill such a person as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.
The torment will be doubled for him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace;
Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And whosoever repents and does righteous good deeds; then verily, he repents towards Allah with true repentance.” [25:68-71] 
Secondly, with regard to your question, “Do I have to marry her?”: this is the issue of the adulterer marrying the woman with whom he committed adultery. The answer is that it is not permissible for him (the adulterer) to marry her, or for her to marry him, until the label of adultery no longer applies to them. That label can only be removed through repentance. 
It is not permissible for you to marry her even if she is Jewish or Christian, because she is a zaniyah (adulteress). Even if she is Muslim, it is not permissible for you to marry her because she is a zaniyah. And it is not permissible for her to accept you as a husband because you are a zani (adulterer). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The adulterer — fornicator marries not but an adulteress — fornicatress or a polytheist; and the adulteress –fornicatress, none marries her except an adulterer — fornicator or a polytheist [and that means that the man who agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan or idolatress) or a prostitute, then surely, he is either an adulterer — fornicator, or a Mushrik (male polytheist, pagan or idolater). And the woman who agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrik or an adulterer — fornicator, then she is either a prostitute or a Mushrikah]. Such a thing is forbidden to the believers (of Islamic Monotheism).” [24:3] 
The phrase “Such a thing is forbidden to the believers” indicates that this marriage is forbidden. 
“It is essential that both of you repent to Allah, give up this sin, regret the evil actions that have occurred in the past, resolve not to return to them, and do many righteous deeds, so that Allah may accept your repentance and turn your bad deeds (sayyiat) into good deeds (hasanat). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘And those who invoke not any other ilah (god) along with Allah, nor kill such a person as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.
The torment will be doubled for him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace;
Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And whosoever repents and does righteous good deeds; then verily, he repents towards Allah with true repentance.” [25:68-71] 
If you want to marry her, you have to be sure that she is not pregnant by waiting to see if she menstruates. If it becomes apparent that she is pregnant, it is not permissible for you to marry her until after she delivers the baby, in accordance with the hadeeth (narration) of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), in which he forbade a man to use his water to irrigate the crops of another.” 
(Fatwas of the Standing Committee in al-Buhooth al-Islamiyyah magazine) 
Thirdly, you say, “so the baby will find a father and gets the name.” This is the matter of attributing the child of adultery: who is he to be named after? 
The answer is that the majority of scholars have said that the child of adultery should not be named after the adulterer, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The child goes to the owner of the bed and the adulterer gets nothing but the stones (despair, i.e., to be stoned to death).” (Agreed upon.) 
Fourthly, you say, that you would prefer the woman to get rid of the baby. This is the issue of abortion, and the ruling on that is as stated in the report of the Committee of Senior Scholars (Hay at Kibar al-‘Ulama) which is as follows: 
“1 – It is not permissible to abort the pregnancy at any of its various stages except for a legitimate shar’i (legal) reason, and within very narrow limits.
2 – If the pregnancy is in the first stage, which is forty days, and aborting it will serve a legitimate shar’i interest or ward off some harm, then it is permissible to abort it. But aborting it at this stage for fear of difficulty in bringing up children or in providing for them or teaching them, or fear for their future, or because the couple feel that they have enough children – this is not permitted.
3 – It is not permissible to abort the pregnancy once it has become an ‘alaqah (clot) or mudghah (chewed lump of flesh) [i.e., after 40 days’ gestation] unless a trustworthy medical committee has stated that allowing the pregnancy to continue poses a danger to the health of the mother, such that there is the fear that she will die if the pregnancy continues. In this case it is permissible to abort the pregnancy, after exhausting all other means of trying to ward off that danger. 
After the third stage, and after the completion of four months of pregnancy, it is not permissible for you to abort the pregnancy unless a group of trustworthy specialist doctors decide that leaving the foetus in his mother’s womb will lead to the death of the mother; this is after exhausting all possible means of keeping the foetus alive. Performing an abortion subject to these conditions is permitted in order to ward off the greater of the two harms, and to preserve the greater of the two interests.”  (Quoted from al-Fatawa al-Jami’ah)

Moving forward and standing beside the Imam


Pulling someone out of the row to stand beside you","Praise be to Allah.Praying alone behind the row
We have stated in the answer to question no. 1947  that it is not acceptable to pray standing on one's own behind the row. This is the well-known view of Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him), and is the view favoured by more than one of the scholars. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about this matter and he gave a detailed answer in which he said: 
Discussion of this matter covers two topics: 

Is the prayer of one who prays on his own behind the row valid or not? 
 If we say that it is not valid, and he finds the row full , what should he do? 


With regard to the first topic, the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differed concerning it. 

Some of them said that the prayer of one who prays on his own behind the row is valid, whether he has an excuse or not, but some of them stated that this is makrooh if one does not have an excuse. This is the view of the three Imams, Malik, Ash-Shafa’i and Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on them). 
They quoted as evidence the fact that the prayer of a woman who prays behind the row is valid, and they said that men and women are equal with regard to Islamic rulings. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not tell Abu Bakrah (may Allah be pleased with him), when he bowed before joining the row, to repeat his prayer. [The Hadith of Abu Bakrah was narrated by Al-Bukhari, 783.) 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) brought Ibn 'Abbas from behind to stand beside him during the prayer [Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 117 and Muslim, 763]. If it permissible for a person to stand alone during part of the prayer, then it should be permissible for him to do so during the whole of the prayer, because if that invalidates the prayer it should make no difference whether it is done to a lesser extent or a greater, like standing in front of the Imam.  
They responded to the Hadiths which forbid praying standing alone behind the row by saying that what is meant is that prayer done in such a manner is lacking (but not invalid). This is like the Hadith in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) says, “There is no prayer when food is ready” [Muslim, 650], and so on. 
Some of the scholars said that the prayer of one who prays on his own behind the row is not valid. This is the view of Imam Ahmad that is well known among his companions. There is another report from him in which he agrees with the other three Imams. 
Those who favour this view based it on reports and rational thinking: 

The report is that which was narrated by Imam Ahmad (15862) from ‘Ali ibn Shayban (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw a man praying behind the row and when he finished he said to him: “Repeat your prayer, for there is no prayer for the one who prays on his own behind the row.” This is a sound Hadith for which there are corroborating reports which suggest that it is authentic. 
As for rational thinking, the jama’ah (congregation ) is a coming together, in which people are in the same place, doing the same actions. So the people who are gathered act in unison, following the Imam , and they are gathered in the same place, namely the rows . If we say that it is permissible for them to be separate from one another, how can they be a unified gathering? 

These scholars responded to the evidence quoted by those who say that it is permissible for a woman to stand on her own behind the row of men by saying that the Sunnah indicates that this is a ruling which applies only to women, as in the Hadith of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “The orphan and I stood behind him – meaning behind the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – and the old woman stood behind us,” [Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 234; Muslim, 658], because it was not appropriate for her to stand beside the men. 
With regard to the Hadith of Abu Bakrah, he did not stand on his own except for a short while and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Don’t do it again.” 
With regard to the Hadith of Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) he did not stand behind the row, rather he was passing by and not standing and praying. 
With regard to their view that what is meant by the Hadith which says there is no prayer for one who stands behind the row is that his prayer is lacking but is still valid, this interpretation is to be rejected because the basic principle concerning negation in Arabic is that it is usually to be understand as meaning that the thing referred to does not exist; if it is not possible to interpret it in this manner, then it is to be understood as meaning that it is not valid; only if it cannot be interpreted in this manner may it be understood as meaning that it is lacking or imperfect.  The Hadith in question may be understood as meaning that such a prayer is invalid, so it should be interpreted in that manner. 
With regard to their quoting the Hadith, “There is no prayer when food is ready,” their interpretation is not valid on two counts: 

The reason for this is that the mind may be distracted because of the food being ready. Distraction of the mind does not mean that the prayer is invalidated, as is clear from the Hadith about waswasah (whispers from the devil) in which it says that satan comes to the worshipper and says, “Remember such and such, remember such and such,” that he had not remembered, and he carries on until (the worshipper) does not know how many rak’ahs he has prayed. [Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 608; Muslim, 389].
The Hadith, “There is no prayer for the one who stands on his own behind the row” clearly indicates that the prayer is not valid, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told him to repeat his prayer and stated that reason for that was that there is no prayer for the one who stands on his own behind the row.

In the Hadith of Wabisah (may Allah be pleased with him) it is stated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw a man praying on his own behind the row, and he told him to repeat his prayer. [Narrated by Abu Dawood, 682; At-Tirmidhi, 230] 
Thus it is clear that the most correct view is that standing in the row is obligatory and that the prayer of one who prays on his own behind the row is invalid, and he must repeat his prayer because he has omitted the duty of standing in the row. 
But this duty, like others, is waived if there is no room in the row, or if a person is unable to do it because of a legitimate Shar’i excuse, or he is physically unable to do it, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.” [At-Taghabun 64:16]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When I command you to do something, do as much of it as you can.”  [Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 7288; Muslim, 1227]  So he should stand in the row wherever he finds a space. If he cannot find a space then this obligation is waived in this case. It is also waived if a person cannot stand in the row for a Shar’i reason. 

An example of the first scenario is: If he finds the row is full, then he can pray standing on his own, because there is no obligation if one is unable to fulfil it. 
An example of the second scenario is: If a woman is on her own with a group of men, she should pray standing on her own behind the row, as is proven in the Sunnah. What is taught in the Sunnah can be taken as a basis for analogy for saying that a man may pray on his own behind the row if he cannot find any space in the row, because a physical excuse is like a Shar’i excuse.  

Explanation: If a man comes and finds the row is full, then he may either move forward and stand beside the Imam, or he can pull someone out of the row to stand beside him, or he can pray on his own, apart from the congregation, or he can pray with the congregation behind the row. 
Moving forward and standing beside the Imam
With regard to moving forward and standing beside the Imam: 

This is going against the Sunnah which is for the Imam to stand on his own, distinct from the congregation by standing in front of them and doing the actions of the prayer before them. This is not refuted by the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood beside Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) [as narrated by Muslim, 412], because in this case the one who came and stood is the Imam who came and stood beside his deputy. Moreover, Abu Bakr could not go back and stand in the row, and it was in the interests of the congregation for him to stand beside the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and relay his Takbirs.
For a person who finds the row full to come and stand beside the Imam causes annoyance to the congregation in order for him to reach the Imam.
It also denies those who come after him the opportunity to stand in a row; if he stands on his own and someone else comes along they will form a row.

Pulling someone out of the row to stand beside you
With regard to pulling someone out of the row to stand beside him, this includes three wrongful actions: 

It creates a gap in the row, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us to form compact rows and forbade us to leave gaps for the devil. [Ahmad, 5691; Abu Dawood, 666; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Sahihah.
It wrongs the person who is pulled out, by moving him from a better spot to a worse spot.
It distracts him from his prayer and he may argue with him and criticise him when he has finished praying.

This is not altered by the report which states that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to a person whom he saw praying on his own behind the row: “Why did you not join the row or pull someone out?” because this is a weak Hadith which cannot be used as evidence. [Narrated by At-Tabarani in Al-Awsat, 8/374. Al-Haythami said: (it is) very inauthentic]. 
As for leaving the congregation and praying on his own, this is omitting an obligatory duty when one is able to do it, so it is a sin. 
Praying with the congregation behind the row is doing one’s duty to the best of one's ability. The one who prays with the congregation must do two things: 

Pray in congregation
Stand in the row with them.

If he is unable to do one of them then he must do the other. 
If it is said that the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “There is no prayer for one who stands alone behind the row” are general in meaning and it makes no difference whether the row is full or not, the answer is that this indicates that the prayer of one who stands alone is invalid because he has omitted the obligation of standing in a row. But if he is not able to do it then this obligation is waived. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) could not have declared a person’s prayer to be invalid for not doing something that he was not able to do. 
Similar examples are to be found in the Hadiths in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no prayer for the one who does not recite the Essence of the Quran (i.e., Surat Al-Fatihah)” [Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 756; Muslim, 394] and “There is no prayer for the one who does not have Wudu” [Narrated by Imam Ahmad, 9137; Abu Dawud, 101; Ibn Majah, 399] – if the latter is authentic. For the one who is unable to recite Al-Fatihah or to do Wudu should pray without them, and his prayer will be sufficient. But he should recite a passage of Quran that is equivalent in length to Al-Fatihah, or he should remember Allah (say Dhikr) if he is unable to recite any Quran, and he should do Tayammum if he is unable to do Wudu’. 
In conclusion, standing in the row is obligatory. If a person comes and the row is full, he should pray with the congregation behind the row, and not go forward to stand beside the Imam or pull someone out to stand beside him, nor should he abandon the prayer in congregation . 
The view that it is permissible to pray in congregation standing alone behind the row if one has an excuse for doing so is the view favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and Shaykh ‘Abd Al-Rahman Al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on them both), and there are some who say it is valid in all cases.
