What is the ruling on this promise?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly:
It is haraam to swear by anything other than Allaah, whether that be one’s father or leader, or on one’s honour or status, etc, because it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever swears an oath then let him swear by Allaah or else keep silent.” Agreed upon. And he said: “Whoever swears an oath, let him not swear by anything other than Allaah. Narrated by al-Nasaa’i. And he said: “Whoever swears an oath by anything other than Allaah has committed shirk.”
Secondly:
The Muslim should not regard anything as equal with Allaah, such as his homeland, the king or the leader, when pledging to work for them. Rather he should say: “I pledge to Allaah that I will do my best to do my duty to Allaah alone, then I will serve my country and help the Muslims, and I will follow the rules of the Scouts that do not go against the sharee’ah of Allaah.
Thirdly:
A person’s actions should be in accordance with the laws of Allaah, and it is not permissible for him to promise that he will act according to the laws of a state or some other human group at all.
And Allaah is the Source of strength.","Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 1/231"

How valid is this Hajj?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We ask Allaah to reward this boss greatly, 
    and to make more people like this among the Muslims, people who make things easy for the Muslims and help them to obey Allaah. 
Your Hajj done in this manner is valid and 
    there is nothing wrong with it if you are able to pay off the installments from your salary. But if your salary is not enough to pay off the 
    installments without delay, or it may lead to you not having enough to spend on the people under your care, then it is better to delay Hajj until 
    Allaah makes it easy for you. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on 
    him) was asked about a person who takes a loan in order to do Hajj. He replied: 
There is nothing wrong with that if he is 
    able to pay it off. 
Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 
    16/393 
The half of the expenses that your boss pays 
    is regarded as a gift, so there is nothing wrong with accepting it and doing Hajj with it.  See question no.

34504,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34504,Problem of a mosque which is said to have been built on land belonging to the waqf of another mosque,"We have a mosque that was built by one of the charitable foundations on land that was bought from an individual person. The problem here is that some of the elders say that that this land on which the mosque was built is a waqf belonging to another mosque. 

We would like to point out to you the following: 

1.     The person who sold this land to the foundation has documents authenticated by the court.

2.     The people in charge of the mosque to which it is said that this land belongs have not asked for this land up till now, knowing that it has been more than a year since they started building it.

3.     The elders do not have any documents indicating that this land is a waqf belonging to that mosque.

4.     The charitable foundation that built the mosque is prepared to buy the land again if it is proven in court that it is a waqf belonging to this mosque.

5.     The mosque which was built on this land is a jaami’ mosque [mosque in which Friday prayers are held] and there is only one other mosque in this village, which belongs to the Sufis and is filled with innovations and no Jumu’ah prayer is held there.

6.     This mosque – praise be to Allaah – is based on the Sunnah. 
Our question here is: 

What is the ruling on praying in this mosque? What is your opinion on those who warn people against praying in this mosque on the basis that it is built on land concerning which there is some doubt? 

Please advise us, may Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Prayer in the mosque is valid, and no 
    attention should be paid to what some of the elders are saying with no foundation. Based on what you have said, the documents that the person who 
    sold you the land had are proof that the owner of the land does indeed own it, unless something to the contrary can be proven. So the words of 
    some of the elders do not  carry any weight here, especially since those who are in charge of the waqf of that land are present and have not asked 
    for it. 
So carry on praying in the mosque, and do not 
    pay any attention to words that are thrown about with no shar’i proof. Those who warn against praying there should fear Allaah, and not repeat the 
    words of others so long as it is contrary to the facts. They should support their words with shar’i evidence, otherwise it is not permissible for 
    them not to pray in this mosque, let alone warn others and stop them from praying there. 
You say in your question, “The charitable 
    foundation that built the mosque is prepared to buy the land again if it is proven that it is a waqf”. It is not permissible to sell a waqf, but 
    if the mosque to which this land was donated as a waqf has no need of it, it is permissible to sell it to someone who will build a mosque on it, 
    which is what has been done. That is if it is proven that this is a waqf.

    correct, and the evidence for that is that Allaah has described in the 
    Qur’aan the stages of the creation of Adam. Allaah says (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 

    “Verily, the likeness of ‘Eesa (Jesus) before Allaah is 
    the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then (He) said to him: ‘Be!’ 
    — and he was”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:59]

    This dust was moistened until it became sticky mud or clay 
    that stuck to the hands. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And indeed We created man (Adam) out of an extract of 
    clay (water and earth)”

    [al-Mu’minoon 23:12]

    “Verily, We created them of a sticky clay”

    [al-Saaffaat 37:12]

    Then it became dried (sounding) clay of altered mud. Allaah 
    says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And indeed, We created man from dried (sounding) clay of 
    altered mud”
    [al-Hijr 15:26]

    Then when it dried it became sounding clay like the clay of 
    pottery. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “He created man (Adam) from sounding clay like the clay of 
    pottery”

    [al-Rahmaan 55:14]

    Then Allaah moulded it into the form that He wanted and 
    breathed into him (his) soul created by Him. Allaah says (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 

    “(Remember) when your Lord said to the angels: ‘Truly, I 
    am going to create man from clay’.
So when I have fashioned 
    him and breathed into him (his) soul created by Me, then you fall down 
    prostrate to him”

    [Saad 38:71-72]

    These are the stages through which the creation of Adam 
    passed according to the Qur’aan. As for the stages of creation which the 
    progeny of Adam pass through, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And indeed We created 
    man (Adam) out of an extract of clay (water and earth).
Thereafter We made him 
    (the offspring of Adam) as a Nutfah (mixed drops of the male and female 
    sexual discharge and lodged it) in a safe lodging (womb of the woman).
Then We made the Nutfah 
    into a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood), then We made the clot into 
    a little lump of flesh, then We made out of that little lump of flesh bones, 
    then We clothed the bones with flesh, and then We brought it forth as 
    another creation. So Blessed is Allaah, the Best of creators”
    [al-Mu’minoon 23:12-14] 

    With regard to the wife of Adam – Hawwa’ (Eve) – Allaah tells 
    us that He created her from him, as He says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“O mankind! Be dutiful to 
    your Lord, Who created you from a single person (Adam), and from him (Adam)

    If that involves deceit and cheating the purchaser, who may 
    think that the new product is the same as the old product, or it involves 
    using a registered trademark or trade name, then doing that is haraam, 
    because it involves deceit and transgression against the rights of others. 
    The Islamic Fiqh Council has issued a statement forbidding transgression 
    against the intangible rights of others (such as copyright and patents etc). 
    The text of this statement is as follows: 

    Trade names, business names, trademarks, written works, 
    inventions and patents are all rights that belong to their owners or 
    authors. According to modern customs and usage they have acquired 
    considerable monetary value. These rights are respected in sharee’ah and it 
    is not permissible to transgress against them.

    From Majallat al-Majma’, issue no. 4, volume 3, p. 
    1167. 

    This applies equally to both Muslims and kaafirs who are not 
    at war against Muslims. 

    With regard to kaafirs who are at war against Muslims, 
    although their wealth is not protected by sharee’ah, copying their 
    trademarks and distributing fake goods with these trademarks is a deception 
    of the buyer, because these trademarks may be something that the buyer is 
    looking for in the product. 

    But if the goods are similar in appearance and design, but 
    the trade name is different, then there is nothing wrong with that, subject 
    to the condition that the clothes are not of types that are forbidden (such 
    as clothing that is unique to the kuffaar and distinguishes them from 
    others, or clothing that does not cover the ‘awrah, or clothing that is tight and shows the shape of the woman’s body).

    then some of the fuqaha’ say that it is permissible to bury the deceased in a coffin in that case. 
It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah 
    (2/312): 
Putting the deceased in a coffin was unknown at the time of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the time of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them), and the best for the Muslims is to follow 
    their way. Hence it is makrooh to put the deceased in a coffin, whether the ground is hard, soft or wet. If the deceased left instructions that he 
    be placed in a coffin, those instructions should not be carried out. The Shaafa’is said that it is permissible if the ground is soft or wet, but 
    according to them such instructions should not be carried out except in such cases.” 
Ibn Qudaamah said: 
It is not recommended to bury the deceased in 
    a coffin, because there is no report that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or his companions did that, and it also 
    involves imitating the people of this world. And the earth absorbs his remains better. 
It says in al-Insaaf: 
It is makrooh to bury the deceased in a coffin, even if the deceased is a woman. This was 
    stated by Imam Ahmad. 
Al-Sharbeeni, the Shaafa’i khateeb, said in 
    his book Mughni al-Muhtaaj: 
It is makrooh to bury the deceased in a coffin according to scholarly consensus, because it is 
    bid’ah (an innovation), unless the ground is wet or soft, in which case it is not makrooh because that serves a purpose. The deceased’s 
    instructions should not be carried out except in this case. Similarly if the deceased has been burned by fire and cannot be carried except in a 
    coffin.  
In al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah it says: 
It is makrooh to bury the deceased in a 
    coffin according to scholarly consensus because it is bid’ah, and his instructions to that effect should not be carried out. But it is not makrooh

    drawn to represent ancient peoples such as the pharaohs and commanders and 
    soldiers during the Crusades, or images of Jesus and Mary that are placed in

    With regard to seeking refuge with Allaah from the accursed 
    Shaytaan when hearing a donkey braying (whilst one is praying), there is no 
    report in the Sunnah to that effect. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen 
    said: 

    If a person sneezes whilst praying, he should say Al-hamdu 
    Lillah, as was narrated in the saheeh report of the story of Mu’aawiyah ibn 
    al-Hakam (may Allaah be pleased with him) when he started to pray with the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then a man among 
    the people sneezed and said, “Al-hamdu Lillaah.” Mu’aawiyah said to 
    him, “Yarhamuk Allaah (may Allaah have mercy on you).” The people 
    glared at Mu’aawiyah, denouncing him for speaking. He said: “May my mother 
    be bereft of me!” then they started to beat their hands on their thighs, 
    indicating to him to be quiet, so he was quiet. When the prayer was over, 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) called him. 
    Mu’aawiyah said: May my father and mother be sacrificed for him. By Allaah, 
    he did not scold me or beat me or rebuke me. He said: “This prayer should 
    not include anything of people’s talk; rather it is tasbeeh (saying ‘Subhaan 
    Allaah’ – glory be to Allaah), takbeer (saying ‘Allaahu akbar’ – Allaah is 
    Most Great) and reciting Qur’aan.” Narrated by Muslim, 537; Abu Dawood, 
    930. 

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    did not tell off the one who sneezed and said Al-hamdu Lillaah whilst 
    praying, which indicates that if a person sneezes during the prayer he 
    should say al-hamdu Lillaah, because there is a reason for doing so. 
    But that does not apply to every dhikr for which the reason for saying it 
    occurs whilst one is praying. 

    Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 13/342. 

    And he was asked: 

    Is it permissible for one who is praying to say al-hamdu 
    Lillaah if he sneezes, and to seek refuge with Allaah if he hears a 
    donkey braying? Is there a difference between obligatory prayers and naafil 
    prayers in that regard? 

    He replied: 

    With regard to saying al-hamdu Lillaah if he sneezes 
    and seeking refuge with Allaah if he hears a donkey braying, that is 
    permissible according to the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah 
    (may Allaah have mercy on him), but it is makrooh according to the well 
    known view of the madhhab of Imam Ahmad. The more correct view is that 
    favoured by Shaykh al-Islam with regard to saying al-hamdu Lillaah if 
    one sneezes. With regard to seeking refuge with Allaah when hearing a donkey 
    braying, it is better not to do that. The difference between them is that 
    saying al-hamdu Lillaah when sneezing is mentioned in the Sunnah, and 
    because it is prescribed by a specific command, unlike when a donkey brays, 
    which is does not concern him, and the worshipper should not let himself be 
    distracted by sounds outside the prayer.  
With regard to the above, 
    it makes no difference whether the prayer is a prescribed (obligatory) 
    prayer or a naafil (supererogatory) prayer.”

    are a sect that is named after Imam Abu’l-Hasan al-Ash’ari (may Allaah have

    Taymiyah in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 4/72 – which may be summed up as 
    follows: a Mu’tazili stage; then following Ibn Kilaab; then following Ahl 
    al-Sunnah, chiefly Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal. Al-Ash’ari clearly stated his 
    final position in his three books: Risaalah ila Ahl al-Thaghr, 
    Maqaalaat al-Islaamiyyeen, and al-Ibaanah. Whoever follows 
    al-Ash’ari at this stage is in accordance with Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah 
    in most issues. Whoever follows his path at the second stage is going 
    against al-Ash’ari himself, and is going against Ahl al-Sunnah in many

Shaykh Ibn

Those later scholars who 
    called themselves after Abu’l-Hasan al-Ash’ari were following the second of 
    his stages of ‘aqeedah. They followed the method of misinterpreting most of 
    the divine attributes, and this only affirmed the seven attributes mentioned 
    in the following line of verse: 

    “Ever-Living, All-Knowing, Able (to do all things), He speaks, He wills, He 
    hears and He sees.” 
They also 
    differed with Ahl al-Sunnah as to how these attributes are to be 
    understood. 
The Standing 
    Committee issued a fatwa (no. 6606, vol. 3/220): 
The Ash’aris 
    are not kuffaar, rather they erred in their interpretation of some of the 
    Divine attributes. 
Based on 
    this, it is better for a Muslim to study Islamic knowledge and sharee’ah 
    only with scholars who are well known for their knowledge and sound belief 
    (‘aqeedah), and to keep away from those who follow bid’ah and go against Ahl 
    al-Sunnah, including the Ash’aris. This is something that is easy to do – 
    praise be to Allaah – because the means of learning have become readily 
    available to all people. The knowledge of the scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah is 
    available through many means such as Islamic tapes, books, and leaflets; 
    there are Islamic bulletin boards and sites on the internet, and many easy 
    ways of accessing knowledge – praise be to Allaah.

34535,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34535,Do we say al-salaamu ‘alayka ayyhu’l-nabiyyu or al-salaam ‘ala al-nabi in the tashahhud?,"Is it correct that after the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that if a person says in the tashahhud “al-salaamu ‘alayka ayyhu’l-nabiyyu (peace be upon you, O Prophet)” there is the fear that this may be shirk, and that we should say “al-salaam ‘ala al-nabi (peace be upon the Prophet)”?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: 

    It was narrated that Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) taught me the tashahhud with my hand between his hands, just as he 
    taught me a soorah from the Qur’aan: “Al-tahiyyaatu Lillaahi 
    wa’l-salawaatu wa’l-tayyibaat al-salaamu ‘alayka ayyuha’l-nabiyyu… (All 
    compliments, prayers and good words are for Allaah, peace be upon you, O 
    Prophet…).” (That was) when he was still among us. When he passed away, we 
    started to say, “al-salaam ‘ala al-nabi (peace be upon the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)).” 

    Many people say the latter version and teach others to do 
    likewise. 

    They replied: 

    The version of the tashahhud that the Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to recite in his 
    prayer and that he commanded his companions to recite is that which was 
    narrated by the two Shaykhs (al-Bukhaari and Muslim) in their Saheehs 
    from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught 
    me the tashahhud with my hand between his hands, just as he taught me a 
    soorah from the Qur’aan: “Al-tahiyyaatu Lillaahi wa’l-salawaatu 
    wa’l-tayyibaat, al-salaamu ‘alayka ayyuha’l-nabiyyu wa rahmat-Allaahi wa 
    barakaatuhu, al-salaamu ‘alayna wa ‘ala ‘ibaad-illaah il-saaliheen, ash-hadu 
    an laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan ‘abduhu wa rasooluh… 
    (All compliments, prayers and good words are for Allaah, peace be upon you, 
    O Prophet, and the mercy of Allaah and His blessings, peace be upon us and 
    upon the righteous slaves of Allaah. I bear witness that there is no god 
    except Allaah and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger). 
    This is the more correct version, because the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught it to his companions and he did not 
    say, When I die then say al-salaamu ‘ala al-nabi (peace be upon the 
    Prophet). 

    They were also asked: 

    In the tashahhud should we say “al-salaamu ‘alayka 
    ayyhu’l-nabiyyu (peace be upon you, O Prophet)” or “al-salaamu ‘ala 
    al-nabi (peace be upon the Prophet)” – because ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood 
    (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: Before the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) died we used to say “al-salaamu ‘alayka 
    ayyhu’l-nabiyyu (peace be upon you, O Prophet)” but after he died we 
    said “al-salaamu ‘ala al-nabi (peace be upon the Prophet)”? 

    They replied: 

    The  correct view is that in the tashahhud the worshipper 
    should say: “al-salaamu ‘alayka ayyuha’l-nabiyyu wa rahmat-Allaahi wa 
    barakaatuhu (peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of Allaah and 
    His blessings,), because this is what is proven in the ahaadeeth. With 
    regard to the report narrated from Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) – if it is a saheeh (sound) narration from him – this is the ijtihaad 
    of the one who did that and it does not contradict the proven ahaadeeth. If 
    the ruling after the death of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) were different than the ruling when he was still alive, 
    he would have told us that. 

    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah 
    wa’l-Ifta’, 7/11-13 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen 
    (may Allaah have mercy on him) has explained this issue very clearly, and 
    has refuted the specious argument of those who claim that the prescribed 
    version is in the nature of calling upon one who is absent. He said:  

    Are the words “al-salaamu ‘alayka (peace be upon you)” 
    a statement or a supplication? I.e., are you stating that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is in a state of peace or are 
    you asking Allaah to grant him peace? 

    The answer is that it is a du’aa’ (supplication) in which you 
    are praying to Allaah to send peace upon him. This is a statement which is 
    serving as a supplication. 

    Is this addressed to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) as people address one another? 

    The answer is No. If that were the case, it would invalidate 
    the prayer, because this prayer should not contain anything of human speech. 
    If that were the case, the Sahaabah would have spoken these words out loud 
    so that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) could 
    hear them, and he would have returned the greeting to them as he used to do 
    when they met him. But as Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said in his book 
    Iqtida’ al-Siraat al-Mustaqeem: Because you are thinking of the 
    Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is so strong when 
    you send salaams upon him, it is as if he is there in front of you and you 
    are addressing him. 

    Hence the Sahaabah used to say “al-salaamu ‘alayka 
    (peace be upon you)”, but he did not hear them, and they would say, “al-salaamu 
    ‘alayka (peace be upon you)” when they were in another land. And we say 
    “al-salaamu ‘alayka (peace be upon you)” when we are in a land other 
    than his, and in a time other than his. 

    With regard to the report narrated in Saheeh al-Bukhaari 
    from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood, which says that after the Messenger  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) passed away they used to say “al-salaamu 
    ‘ala al-nabi wa rahmat-Allaahi wa barakaatuhu (peace be upon the Prophet 
    and the mercy and blessings of Allaah)” – this was the ijtihaad of Ibn 
    Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him), which differed from that of one 
    who was more knowledgeable than him, namely ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, for he 
    addressed the people from the minbar of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said in the tashahhud: “al-salaamu 
    ‘alayka ayyhu’l-nabiyyu wa rahmat-Allaah (peace be upon you, O Prophet 
    and the mercy of Allaah)”, as was narrated by Maalik in al-Muwatta’ 
    with the soundest of isnaads. ‘Umar said this in the presence of the 
    Sahaabah and they approved of it. 

    Moreover the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) taught it to his ummah, and he even taught it to Ibn Mas’ood, 
    holding his hand between his own, so that he would remember this wording. He 
    used to teach it to them as he used to teach them a soorah from the Qur’aan. 
    And he knew that he was going to die, because Allaah said to him 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Verily, you (O Muhammad) will die, and verily, they (too) 
    will die”

    [al-Zumar 39:30]
But he did not say: after I die, say “al-salaamu ‘ala 
    al-nabi (peace be upon the Prophet)”, rather he taught them the 
    tashahhud as he used to teach them a soorah of the Qur’aan, with this 
    wording. Hence we should not rely on the ijtihaad of Ibn Mas’ood, rather we 
    should say, “al-salaamu ‘alayka ayyhu’l-nabiyyu (peace be upon you, O 
    Prophet)”.

34536,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34536,Turning power back on during the prayer after a power outage,"We started to pray and the electricity cut out. When the power came back on, during the prayer, one of the worshippers stepped forward to turn the microphone on, then he went back to his prayer. Is that permissible or not?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The worshipper should avoid making movements that have nothing to do with prayer whilst he is praying, especially if there is no need to do that whilst he is praying, because that is part of establishing prayer properly as we have been commanded to do. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Guard strictly (five obligatory) As‑Salawaat (the prayers) especially the middle Salaah (i.e. the best prayer ‑ ‘Asr). And stand before Allaah with obedience [and do not speak to others during the Salaah (prayers)]” [al-Baqarah 2:238]
Shaykh Ibn Sa’di (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his Tafseer: i.e., with humility and proper focus. 
And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Successful indeed are the believers.
2. Those who offer their Salaah (prayers) with all solemnity and full submissiveness” [al-Mu’minoon 23:1-2]
With regard to what you mention about one of the worshippers stepping forward to turn on the microphone whilst he is praying, this movement of his does not invalidate the prayer. If there was a need to turn on the microphone during the prayer, such as if the congregation was large and they could not all hear the imam’s voice, then he did well by doing that. 
But if there was no need to turn on the microphone during the prayer, then he did a makrooh action, but his prayer is not invalidated, because such actions are regarded as small movements which do not invalidate the prayer. 
For more information on the rulings on moving during the prayer, please see question no. 12683. 
But we should point out here that amplifiers should not be used outside the mosque as many people do nowadays, because that disturbs worshippers in other mosques or people who are praying in their homes, such as women and those who are exempted from praying in the mosque.

34550,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34550,How did the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) marry Khadeejah?,Many of my friends have asked me about having Affairs with there opposite sex.........Now I have told them this is Haram in Islam but they give me the reply by saying that Khadija (R.A.A.H) fell in love with out Prophet (S.A.S) And had married him. I have read a lot of books and even on the net i havent found any information about how they were married and all i knew was Khadija (R.A.A.H) SENT a message though a Slave girl who was the cousin of our Prophet (S.A.S). And Abu Talib (R.A.A.H) uncle of our Prophet (S.A.S) accepted the offer and wed them. Now i wanted to know that have they (Prophet (S.A.S) and Khadijah (R.A.A.H)) ever met prior to marraige?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The reports of the seerah (Prophet’s biography) indicate that Khadeejah bint Khuwaylid (may Allah be pleased with her) was a determined and intelligent woman, and she was also rich and had several kinds of trade. The men of her people were keen to marry her. She did not engage directly in trade herself, rather she used to employ men to work on her behalf. 
News reached Khadeejah of the honest and trustworthy Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him); she heard a great deal about his honesty and trustworthiness, so she wanted to hire him to work for her and do trade on her behalf. She sent someone to him with an offer of work, and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) agreed to that. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went out to do trade with the money of Khadeejah (may Allah be pleased with her), and there was with him a slave of Khadeejah’s whose name was Maysarah.  Maysarah saw the signs that happened to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) whilst travelling, and that amazed him, so he started to tell his mistress Khadeejah about everything that he had seen. 
For example, when the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to the city of Busra in Syria, he stopped in the shade of a tree, and one of the monks said to Maysarah, “No one ever stops under the shade of this tree but a Prophet.” And Maysarah used to see two angels shading the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when the heat of the sun grew too intense. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came back from that journey, and he had made far more money in trading for Khadeejah than anyone else ever had before. Khadeejah was impressed with the personality of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and she wanted to marry him. So she sent her friend Nafeesah bint Maniyyah to tell the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about that. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) agreed, and the marriage of Khadeejah (may Allah be pleased with her) was arranged by her father Khuwaylid, according to the most sound reports, as mentioned by the scholars of seerah. 
From the above it is clear that there was no inappropriate relationship between the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Khadeejah (nay Allah be pleased with her) before he married her. 
The morals of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) were sound and he lived a virtuous life; Allah protected him from everything that may have detracted from his message or that was contrary to modesty and chivalry.
If such a thing has happened – but he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is far above such a thing – the kuffaar of Quraysh would not have kept quiet about it. They would have regarded it as a great source of shame and they would have used it as a means to reject his religion and tarnish his reputation. But nothing of the sort happened, rather before his Prophethood they used to call him al-Saadiq (the honest one) and al-Ameen (the trustworthy one). They did not cast aspersions upon his chastity at all. 
You should also note that the Prophets (peace be upon them) – all the Prophets – are the most perfect and best of human beings. Allah does not choose anyone to convey His Message except those who are fit for it. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah knows best with whom to place His Message” [al-An’aam 6:124]
Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
This means, He knows best where to place His Message and who is most fit for that among His creation. This is like the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And they say: ‘Why is not this Quran sent down to some great man of the two towns (Makkah and Taa’if)?’
 
Is it they who would portion out the Mercy of your Lord?” [al-Zukhruf 43:31]
What they meant was, If this Quran had been sent down to some great man or leading figure who was of high status in their eyes, “of the two towns” i.e., Makkah and al-Taa’if. That was because they – may Allah curse them – despised the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) out of hatred and envy, and stubbornness and pride, as Allah tells us (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And when those who disbelieved (in the Oneness of Allah) see you (O Muhammad), they take you not except for mockery (saying): “Is this the one who talks (badly) about your gods?” While they disbelieve at the mention of the Most Gracious (Allah)” [al-Anbiya’ 21:36]
And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And when they see you (O Muhammad), they treat you only in mockery (saying): ‘Is this the one whom Allah has sent as a Messenger’” [al-Furqaan 25:41] 
“And indeed (many) Messengers before you were mocked at, but their scoffers were surrounded by the very thing that they used to mock at” [al-An’aam 6:10]
This happened even though they were aware of his virtue, nobility and lineage, and the purity of his house and upbringing.  Before the Revelation came to him, they used to refer to him amongst themselves as al-Ameen (the trustworthy one). The leader of the kuffaar, Abu Sufyaan, admitted that when Heraclius, the ruler of Rome, asked him. “What is his lineage amongst you?” He said, “He is of noble descent.” He asked,”Did you ever accuse him of lying before he said what he said?” He said, “No.” In this lengthy conversation the Roman ruler took the pure attributes of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as evidence that his Prophethood was real and that what he said was true. 
The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) stated that the Prophets were protected from committing major sins and every kind of sin which points to the base character of the one who does it. 
Ibn al-‘Arabi said: “Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was protected by his Lord against committing any sin, whether during the Jaahiliyyah or afterwards, as an honour from Allah, so that he might occupy a great and lofty status. So throughout his life he was protected from sin. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
You should note that the scholars differed as to whether the Prophets could commit sin. Al-Qaadi summed up the main points of this issue when he said… with regard to sin, there is no dispute that the Prophets were protected from committing any major sin. Similarly there was no dispute that they were protected from minor sins which reflect badly on a person and lower his status and damage his character. But they differed as to whether the Prophets could commit other kinds of minor sins. Most of the fuqaha’, hadeeth scholars and scholars of kalaam among the earlier and later generations are of the view that they could have committed such minor sins. They quote as evidence the apparent meaning of the Quran and reports. Some of the fuqaha’ and scholars of kalaam among our imams are of the view that they were protected from minor sins just as they were protected from major sins, and that the position of Prophethood means that the Prophets were far above committing sin or deliberately going against Allah’s commands.  They commented on verses and ahaadeeth which refer to mistakes on the part of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and they interpreted them in a manner other than the apparent meaning. They said that these verses and ahaadeeth refer to incidents where a Prophet based his actions on his own reasoning, or he did what he did out of forgetfulness, or with permission from Allah in cases where he feared that he would be blamed for it, or there might be mistakes that they made    before Prophethood. This last view is the one which is correct. These are the words of al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad, may Allah have mercy on him. And Allah knows best. 
Out of respect towards the position of Prophethood, the scholars said that whoever slanders any of the Prophets is a kaafir and must be executed. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in Majma’ al-Fataawa, 35/123 
The imams are agreed that whoever insults a Prophet should be executed. And an accusation of adultery is the worst kind of insult. See also Question no. 22809. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni, 12/405 
Whoever slanders the mother of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is to be executed even if he repents, whether he is a Muslim or a kaafir, but if he repents then his repentance will be accepted by Allah, but the sentence of execution will not be waived because of his repentance, because of the rights of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Then he said: 
The ruling concerning slander of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is like the ruling on slander of his mother, because slandering his mother brings a sentence of execution because it is a slander against the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and against his lineage. 
And Allah knows best.

34551,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34551,"He died and left behind wealth on which he did not pay zakaah, and interest","There is a young man who has not yet reached the age of twenty, and he has two older sisters. His father died and left them an inheritance, but his father only prayed occasionally and he did not pay zakaah of 2.5% on his accumulated wealth each year. He used to spend on his household from the interest he got from the bank. My question is:

1- What is the ruling on the zakaah on this wealth that was not paid for several years?

2- How can expiation be offered for that haraam interest that he used to spend on his household for several years?

3- This man left behind a large amount of his wealth in the form of certificates that pay interest. How can these haraam certificates be gotten rid of, knowing that this young man has no experience in administering wealth or trading, and he does not even have time for that because of his studies?.

4- What are the forms of ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyyah) that are accepted nowadays?

5- The father died of liver cancer and there were no signs of a bad end just before he died. He used to repeat the phrase Al-hamdu Lillaah (praise be to Allaah) often before he died. Is he a shaheed because he died of an internal disease?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If the deceased had repented to Allaah for not praying and 
    was keen to perform prayers before he died, then there is the hope that he 
    is a shaheed (martyr), because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “The martyrs are five: the one who dies of the 
    plague, the one who dies of an internal disease, the one who dies by 
    drowning, the one who is crushed by a falling wall and the one who is 
    martyred for the sake of Allaah.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2829; Muslim, 
    1914. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: The one who dies of an internal disease refers to 
    stomach disease, i.e., diarrhoea. Al-Qaadi said: And it was said that it 
    refers to the one who is afflicted with dropsy and his stomach swells; and 
    it was said it is the one who suffers from a complaint in his stomach; and 
    it was said that it is the one who dies from any kind of internal disease. 

    From Sharh Muslim.  

    1 – It is obligatory to pay the zakaah that is owed from past 
    years, by estimating how much he owned – each year – of permissible wealth 
    on which zakaah is due, such as currency and gold, that reached the 
    threshold at which zakaah becomes due and that had been in his possession 
    for a full hijri year, and without including the haraam interest. One 
    quarter of one tenth should be paid on that, i.e. 2.5%. Then what is left 
    for the following year should be estimated and 2.5% paid likewise, and so 
    on. 

    2 – With regard to what his heirs have consumed of interest 
    (riba), they should repent from that, if they knew that it was haraam, and 
    they should try hard to make du’aa’ for their father that he be forgiven by 
    Allaah, because consuming riba is a major sin. May Allaah protect us and all 
    the Muslims from that. 

    3 – The heirs are not entitled to anything from the 
    certificate mentioned but the original capital. It is not permissible to 
    take the haraam interest. If the bank insists that the heirs take it, it 
    should be taken from the bank and given to the poor and needy, or spent in 
    the interests of the Muslims, so as to get rid of it. See question no.
    20695. 

    If there is an Islamic bank whose transactions are governed 
    by sharee’ah, it is permissible to invest the money through them. 

    Ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyah) may be done in many ways, 
    such as building a mosque or contributing to the building, buying books for 
    seekers of Islamic knowledge, buying Mushafs to be placed in the mosque, or 
    donating a house or shop as a waqf and stipulating that its income be spent 
    on the poor, orphans, relatives, students or others, as stated by the 
    founder, or donating money for building a charitable hospital, and so on. In 
    some countries there are organizations that are responsible for waqfs, which 
    you can contact and establish a waqf or contribute to one through them. 

    The best way in which you can benefit the deceased after his 
    death is to make du’aa’ for him and strive hard in making du’aa’ for him 
    that Allaah bestow His vast mercy upon him and forgive him his sins.

There may be some (acceptable) reasons for having a sex-change operation that turns one from a male into a female. But what is mentioned in the question is no more than a wish or a desire, although the male genitalia were complete. It is not a case of what the fuqaha’ call al-khuntha (hermaphrodite). Rather this person is naturally male, with all the attributes of masculinity, but he wants to turn into a female, so he has surgery to remove the penis and testicles, then the doctors construct a vagina and increase the size of the breasts, and administer hormone injections over a lengthy period until the voice becomes softer and the distribution of fat on the body changes, and the person appears outwardly to be female, but in fact he is a male. 
This operation is haram in Islam, according to all the reputable contemporary scholars. The earlier scholars did not discuss it because it was not known and was not possible during their time. The fact that it is forbidden is indicated by a number of things, including the following: 
Firstly: the verses in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘They (all those who worship others than Allah) invoke nothing but female deities besides Him (Allah), and they invoke nothing but Shaytaan (Satan), a persistent rebel!
118. Allah cursed him. And he [Shaytaan (Satan)] said: “I will take an appointed portion of your slaves.
119. “Verily, I will mislead them, and surely, I will arouse in them false desires; and certainly, I will order them to slit the ears of cattle, and indeed I will order them to change the nature created by Allah.” And whoever takes Shaytaan (Satan) as a Wali (protector or helper) instead of Allah, has surely, suffered a manifest loss.
120. He [Shaytaan (Satan)] makes promises to them, and arouses in them false desires; and Shaytaan’s (Satan) promises are nothing but deceptions.
121. The dwelling of such (people) is Hell, and they will find no way of escape from it’ [al-Nisa’ 4:117-121]
Undoubtedly doing such operations is a kind of toying with and changing the creation of Allah. 
Secondly: It is proven in al-Saheeh that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed men who imitate women and women who imitate men. Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5546. 
Ibn Hajar said: For men to imitate women and women to imitate men, deliberately and by choice, is haram according to scholarly consensus. 
Thirdly: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade hermaphrodites to enter upon women, if they pay attention to women and their charms, and he ordered that they be banned from living among people so as to guard against their evil.  
Imam al-Bukhaari included this hadeeth in two chapters: (1) under the heading: “It is forbidden for men who resemble women to enter upon women” and (2) under the heading: “Expelling men who resemble women from people’s houses.” 
Ibn Hajar said: What we learn from this is that women should observe hijab before those hermaphrodites who pay attention to women's charms, and that they should be banned from living among people, as a means to deter them. And it seems that doing this is obligatory. 
Fourthly: According to specialist doctors, this kind of operation is not indicated by any kind of sound medical evidence, and it is no more than the matter of personal whims and desires. 
And there is other evidence which indicates that it is haram. For more information, please see the book Ahkaam al-Jaraahah al-Tibbiyyah, p. 199 
Dr Muhammad ‘Ali al-Barr said: Although the outward appearance of such a person may deceive you into thinking that he is female, in fact his biological structure remains male, even if it has been obliterated completely. Moreover, there is no ovary or uterus and such a person cannot menstruate or get pregnant at all. 
Based on the above, it is not permissible under any circumstances for a woman to be alone with him, or to uncover or take off her hijab in front of him, because he is in fact male, even though he may now feel attracted towards males, because of the many female hormones in his system. Undoubtedly these people are worse than the hermaphrodites whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade to enter upon men, and ordered that they be banned from living among the people. 
Hence it may be more appropriate for more than one person to meet with him, and to take him to a trustworthy psychologist who can treat his illness. We ask Allah to guide him and set his affairs straight. 
You could speak to a trustworthy Shaykh or seeker of knowledge, and ask him to receive this person and teach him about his religion and its rulings, and strengthen his ties with Islam and help him to grow steadfast in his faith. This should be done in the presence of more than one person. You should also understand that after doing as much as you can for this person, guidance is in the hand of Allah; He guides whomsoever He will of His slaves. And Allah knows best.

 -         Aaminah (the grandmother) is the sister of Zaynab and breastfed Faatimah the daughter of Zaynab.

-         Then Aaminah breastfed Umm Kathoom (her daughter’s daughter).

 The issue is that one of Faatimah’s sons has proposed marriage to Umm Kalthoom. Is this marriage permissible?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The question may be summed up by saying that 
    Aaminah breastfed both Faatimah and Umm Kalthoom, so Faatimah and Umm Kalthoom are sisters through breastfeeding. So it is not permissible for any 
    of Faatimah’s sons to marry Umm Kalthoom, because she is their maternal aunt through breastfeeding. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “What becomes mahram (forbidden for marriage) through breastfeeding is that which become mahram through blood ties.”Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2645; Muslim, 1445. 
The maternal aunt through blood ties is a 
    mahram just as is the maternal aunt through breastfeeding. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said in al-Mughni (7/87): 
Every woman who is a mahram (forbidden for 
    marriage) because of blood ties, her equivalent through breastfeeding is also a mahram, namely mothers, daughters, sisters, paternal aunts, 
    maternal aunts, brother’s daughters and sister’s daughters… because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “What 
    becomes mahram (forbidden for marriage) through breastfeeding is that which become mahram through blood ties.”
    Agreed upon. And we do not know of any differing opinion on this matter. 
Being a mahram because of breastfeeding 
    depends on two things: 
1– That the child be breastfed five times, meaning that the infant grasps the nipple and … then lets 
    go.
2– These five breastfeedings should have taken place before he reaches the age of two.

What is the ruling on us visiting one another?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If the visits are for the purpose of offering 
    advice and cooperating in righteousness and piety, then this is something that is good and is enjoined in Islam. The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah says, ‘My Love becomes an entitlement for two who love one another for My sake, and two who visit 
    one another for My sake, and two who sit with one another for My sake, and two who are generous to one another for My sake.’” Narrated by Imam 
    Maalik (may Allaah have mercy on him) with a saheeh isnaad. And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There are 
    seven whom Allaah will shade with His shade on the Day when there will be no shade but His,” among whom he mentioned, “two men who love one 
    another for the sake of Allaah, meeting and parting on that basis.” The example given is that of two men, but the ruling is general and may apply 
    to two men or two women. If the visit to a Muslim or Christian woman is for the purpose of da’wah, calling them to Allaah, and teaching them and 
    guiding them to good things, and not for the purpose of worldly ambitions or taking the commands of Allaah lightly, then this is all good. If a 
    Muslim woman visits her sister in Allaah and advises her to avoid tabarruj (wanton display) and unveiling, and to avoid being careless with regard 
    to all the sins that Allaah has forbidden, or she visits a neighbour who is Christian or otherwise, such as a Buddhist etc., to advise her and 
    teach her, this is something good and comes under the heading of the Prophet’s words, “Religion is sincerity (naseehah), religion is sincerity, 
    religion is sincerity.”  If she accepts the advice, then praise be to Allaah; if she does not then you should give up the visits which do not 
    serve any useful purpose.  
With regard to visits for worldly purposes 
    such as leisure, idle talk or eating etc., it is not permissible to make such visits to kaafir women, whether they are Christian or otherwise,

What to say when you visit the grave of the Prophet 


Is saying (al-salamu `alayum) when visiting graves shirk?","Praise be to Allah.Can Muslims visit graves?
Visiting graves is mustahabb for men, because according to the hadith of Buraydah ibn al-Husayb, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I used to forbid you to visit graves , but now visit them.” (Narrated by Muslim, 977), according to another report, “… for they will remind you of the Hereafter.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 1240; Ibn Majah, 1569; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih ibn Majah) 
How to say salam to the dead?
When visiting the graves it is mustahabb to greet the occupants of the graves with salam and to make du`a for them saying the words that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to teach his Companions. 
It was narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “O Messenger of Allah, what should I say to them (i.e., to the occupants of the graves)?” He said, “Say: Al-salamu ‘ala ahl il-diyar min al-mu’minin wa’l-Muslimin, wa yarham Allah al-mustaqdimina minna wa’l-mustakhirin, wa innaa in sha Allah bikum la lahiqun (Peace be upon the inhabitants of the graves, believers and Muslims. May Allah have mercy upon those who have gone ahead of us and those who come later on, and verily we will, in sha Allah, join you).” (Narrated by Muslim, 974) 
It was narrated from Buraydah ibn al-Husayb (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to teach them, when they went out to the graveyard , to say: “Al-salamu ‘alaykum ahl al-diaar min al-mu’minin wa’l-Muslimin, wa inna in sha Allah lalahiqun. As-alu Allah lana wa lakum al-‘afiyah (Peace be upon you, O inhabitants of the graves, believers and Muslims. Verily we will, in sha Allah, join you. I ask Allah for well-being for us and for you).”” 
What to say when you visit the graves of the Companions
With regard to the graves of the Companions, he should say the same du`as as described above; there is no special du`a for that. 
What to say when you visit the grave of the Prophet 
With regard to visiting the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his two Companions Abu Bakr and ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them), what was narrated from the Companions is to greet them with salam. 
Ibn ‘Umar used to say, “Al-salamu ‘alayka ya Rasul-Allah, al-salam ‘alayka ya Aba Bakr, al-salamu ‘alayka ya abati (O my father),” then he would go away. This was classed as sahih by al-Hafiz ibn Hajar. 
Some of the scholars added to that: “Al-salamu ‘alayka ya khirat Allah min khalqihi, al-salamu ‘alayka ya sayyid al-mursalin, ash-hadu annaka ballaghta al-risalah (Peace be upon you, whom Allah chose from among His creation; peace be upon you O leader of the Messengers, I bear witness that you indeed conveyed the message).” (See al-Adhkar by al-Nawawi, p. 174; al-Mughni, 5/466) 
Al-Tabari said: “If the visitor says the above longer version, there is nothing wrong with that, but following the example (of the Sahabah) is better, i.e., limiting oneself to what was narrated from the Companions is better.” 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Manasik al-Hajj wa’l-‘Umrah: 
“After (the pilgrim) prays upon arrival in the Prophet’s Mosque as much as Allah wills he should pray, he should go and send salams upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his two Companions Abu Bakr and ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them). 

He should stand in front of the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), facing the grave and with his back towards the qiblah, and say, “Al-salamu ‘alayka ayyuha’l-Nabiyyu wa rahmat-Allahi wa barakatuhu (Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy and blessings of Allah).” If he wants to add something appropriate there is nothing wrong with that, such as saying, “Al-salamu ‘alayka ya khalil-Allah wa aminahu ‘ala wahyihi wa khiratahu min khalqihi, ash-hadu annaka qad ballaghta al-risalah wa addayta al-amanah wa nasahta al-ummah wa jahadta fi Allahi haqqa jihadihi (Peace be upon you, O close friend of Allah, the one with whom He entrusted His revelation and the one whom He chose from among His creation. I bear witness that you conveyed the message, fulfilled the trust, sincerely advised the ummah and strove with all your might for the sake of Allah). 

But if he limits himself to the first salutation, that is good. Ibn ‘Umar used to say “Al-salamu ‘alayka ya Rasool-Allah, al-salam ‘alayka ya Aba Bakr, al-salamu ‘alayka ya abati (O my father),” then he would go away 

Then he should take one step to his right so that he is in front of Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) and say, “Al-salamu ‘alayka ya Aba Bakr, al-salamu ‘alayka ya khalifata Rasul-illah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fi ummatihi, radiya Allahu ‘anka wa jazaka ‘an ummati Muhammadin khayran (Peace be upon you, O Abu Bakr, peace be upon you O Successor of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in his ummah, may Allah be pleased with you and reward you with good on behalf of Muhammad).” 
Then he should take one step to his right so that he is in front of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) and say, “Al-salamu ‘alayka ya ‘Umar, al-salamu ‘alayka ya amir al-muminin, radiya Allahu ‘anka wa jazaka ‘an ummati Muhammadin khayran (Peace be upon you, O ‘Umar, peace be upon you, O leader of the believers, may Allah be pleased with you and reward you with good on behalf of Muhammad).  

But he should send salams upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his two Companions with proper etiquette and in a low voice, for raising the voice in the mosque is forbidden, especially in the Mosque of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and at his grave.” (Manasik al-Hajj wa’l-‘Umrah wa’l-Mashru’ fi’l-Ziyarah, p. 107, 108) 
Is saying (al-salamu `alayum) when visiting graves shirk?
If a person says “al-salamu ‘alayum” when visiting graves, and says, “Al-salamu ‘alayka ya Rasul-Allah” when visiting the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), this is not considered to be shirk, because it is not a prayer to the dead or seeking their help. Rather it is du`a for them, praying that Allah may keep them safe from all the dangers that a person may encounter after death, such as the torment of the grave, the resurrection, the reckoning and the horrors of the Hereafter. (See Zad al-Mustanqi’, 5/473; Ashrat al-Saa’ah by Dr. Yusuf al-Wabil, p. 337)

What I mean is that if he wants to keep away from everything that Allaah has forbidden and enjoy everything that Allaah has permitted in His Holy Book, and follow the Sunnah of His chosen Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in what he has permitted and keep away from that which he has forbidden?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Muslim is not infallible.

“So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can”

His religious commitment is not affected by some sins that he may commit without meaning to, or that he thinks are permissible according to his own ijtihaad and reasoning and the information that he has, or that he asked some scholars about and they gave him a fatwa concerning that but the fatwa was not in accordance with sharee’ah. To sum up, what the Muslim has to do is to keep his duty towards Allaah and fear Him as much as he can, to regard as forbidden that which Allaah has forbidden to him, and to strive to do that which Allaah has enjoined upon him.

    doomed. It was narrated in a saheeh hadeeth that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The likeness of a 
    good companion is that of one who carries perfume: either he will give you some, or you will buy some from him, or you will notice a good

    forgiveness of Allaah; so he should beseech Allaah not to leave him to his own devices and not to judge him by his deeds. Hence the Messenger of

    Allaah will ward off these whispers and save you from the traps of the 
    Shaytaan and that He will help you to turn to Him and turn away from the 
    Shaytaan. 

    Fataawa al-Lajnah, 7/156. See 
    also 7/36. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about a woman whose mind wanders a great 
    deal whilst praying – should she repeat her prayer? 

    He replied: 

    Waswaas (whispers) come from the Shaytaan. What you have to 
    do is to pay attention to your prayer, focus on it and be at ease with it, 
    until you are doing it as it should be done. Allaah says (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 

    “Successful indeed are the believers.
2. Those who offer their 
    Salaah (prayers) with all solemnity and full submissiveness”
    [al-Mu’minoon 23:1] 

    When the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) saw a man who was not praying properly and was not at ease in prayer, 
    he told him to repeat it and said to him: “When you stand to pray, do wudoo’ 
    properly, then stand to face the qiblah and say takbeer. Then recite 
    whatever you can of Qur’aan, then bow until you are at ease in bowing, then 
    stand up until you are standing straight. Then prostrate until you are at 
    ease in prostration, then sit up until you are at ease in sitting, then 
    prostrate until you are at ease in prostration, then do that throughout your 
    prayer.” Agreed upon. 

    If you remember that when you are praying you are standing 
    before Allaah and conversing with Him, may He be glorified, that will prompt 
    you to be focused and humble in your prayer. It will keep the Shaytaan away 
    from you and protect you from his whispers. 

    If you experience a great deal of waswaas (whispers from the 
    Shaytaan) in your prayers, then spit drily to your left three times and seek 
    refuge with Allaah from the accursed Shaytaan three times, then he will 
    depart from you in sha Allaah. 

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    commanded one of his companions to do that, when he said to him: “O 
    Messenger of Allaah, the Shaytaan makes me confused about my prayer.” See 
    Saheeh Muslim, 2203. 
You do not have to 
    repeat your prayer because of waswaas, rather you have to do the prostration 
    of forgetfulness if you did something that necessitates it, such as omitting 
    the first tashahhud by mistake, or forgetting to say tasbeeh when bowing or 
    prostrating. 

    If you are not sure whether you have prayed three rak’ahs or 
    four, when praying Zuhr for example, then you should assume it is three and 
    complete your prayer (by praying another rak’ah), and do the two 
    prostrations of forgetfulness before saying the salaam. 

    If you are not sure whether you have prayed two or three 
    rak’ahs in Maghrib, then you should assume it is two and complete your 
    prayer (by praying another rak’ah), then do the two prostrations of 
    forgetfulness before saying the salaam, because this is what the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined. And Allaah is the 
    Source of strength. 

    Fataawa al-Shaykh, 11/260 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen 
    (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: If a person is overwhelmed by 
    wandering thoughts whilst praying, what is the ruling on his prayer? How can 
    he rid himself of these thoughts?  

    He replied: In this case, if a person is overwhelmed by 
    thoughts of either worldly matters or religious matters whilst praying, such 
    as if he is a seeker of knowledge and when he starts to pray his mind 
    wanders to thoughts of issues of knowledge, and this happens during most of 
    his prayer, most scholars are of the view that his prayer is still valid and 
    that it is not invalidated by this waswaas, but it is severely lacking. A 
    person may be distracted whilst praying so only one-half of it, or 
    one-quarter, or one-tenth or less, is recorded for him, as it says in 
    Saheeh al-Musnad, 18400; Abu Dawood, 796. 
But he has discharged 
    his duty, even if that happened a great deal. But he should be focused when 
    praying, because that is khushoo’ (proper focus and humility), and khushoo’ 
    is the essence and spirit of prayer. 

    The remedy for that is to do what the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded, namely spitting drily to the 
    left three times and seeking refuge with Allaah from the accursed Shaytaan. 
    If he does that, Allaah will take it away. 
If a person is praying 
    in congregation, standing in the row, then he cannot spit because there are 
    people to his left. In that case he should just seek refuge with Allaah from 
    the accursed Shaytaan. If he does that and repeats it, Allaah will take that 
    away from him. And Allaah is the Source of strength.

34571,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34571,Divorcing a wife because of her bad attitude,"My brother-in-law had a miserable married life for last two years. his wife used to behave badly with him and the worst thing the girl used to torture /abuse her mother-in-law .

After many tormenting and disgusting discussions the boy,his mother, his father and his sister decided divorce is the only solution and he divorced. Please clarify whether the stance taken was right or not? .",,,"Praise be to Allah.The basic principle concerning divorce is 
    that it is makrooh. This is indicated by the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Those who take an oath not to have sexual relation with their wives must wait for four months, 
    then if they return (change their idea in this period), verily, Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
227. And if they decide upon divorce, then 
    Allaah is All-Hearer, All-Knower”
[al-Baqarah 2:226]
With regard to the oath not to have sexual 
    relations, Allaah says “Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”, but with regard to divorce, He says, “All-Hearer, All-Knower”. This contains 
    an element of warning, and this indicates that divorce is makrooh or disliked by Allaah. 
But there may be some situations in which there is no alternative to divorce, and matters 
    may reach a point where divorce becomes essential. In a situation such as that mentioned in the question, divorce is an appropriate solution, 
    because one of the rights that a husband has over his wife is that she should respect his family, especially the husband’s mother. The mother’s 
    rights over a man come before his wife’s rights, so the wife should help her husband to honour his mother. 
The scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) have stated that divorce is permissible in 
    cases where it is needed because of the wife’s bad attitude and bad conduct and because she is causing too much harm and not doing what she is 
    supposed to do.

34575,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34575,Seeking help from anyone other than Allaah is shirk,"I often hear people saying “Madad ya Rasool-Allaah, Madad ya Sayyidina al-Husayn, madad ya Sayyid yaa Badawi…” and I do not know the meaning of these words.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It should be noted that Allaah has created the universe to 
    worship Him and Him alone. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And I (Allaah) created not the jinn and mankind except 
    that they should worship Me (Alone)”

    [al-Dhaariyaat 51:56]
Allaah sent the 
    Messengers to call their people to worship Allaah alone (Tawheed) and to 
    forbid them to associate anything with Him (shirk). Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad) 
    but We revealed to him (saying): Laa ilaaha illa Ana [none has the right to 
    be worshipped but I (Allaah)], so worship Me (Alone and none else)”
    [al-Anbiya’ 21:25]

    Shirk means directing worship to anyone other than Allaah, 
    and du’aa’ comes under the heading of worship which must be devoted to 
    Allaah alone and not directed to anyone else. Hence the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Du’aa’ is worship.” Narrated by 
    al-Tirmidhi, 2969; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 

    Asking for madad from anyone other than Allaah, as 
    mentioned in the question, is a kind of calling upon (or making du’aa’ to) 
    someone other than Allaah, hence it is a kind of shirk. 

    It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (2/193): 

    The words of some of those who sing nasheed, “Madad ya 
    sayyidina al-Husayn (Help O our master al-Husayn), madad ya Sayyidah 
    Zaynab, madad ya Badawi ya Shaykh al-‘Arab, madad ya Rasool 
    Allaah (O Messenger of Allaah), madad ya awliya’ Allaah (O close 
    friends – or ‘saints’ – of Allaah),” etc, is major shirk which puts the one 
    who says it beyond the pale of Islam (Allaah forbid), because it is calling 
    upon the dead to give them good things, to help them, to ward off danger or 
    relieve them of harm. That is because what is meant by madad is 
    giving, help and support. So it as if the person who says, “Madad ya 
    Sayyid ya Badawi, madad ya Sayyidah Zaynab” etc is saying: Help 
    us and give us of your bounty, and relieve us of hardship and ward off 
    calamity from us. This is major shirk. Allaah says, after explaining to His 
    slaves that He is in control of the universe and that it is subjugated to 
    Him:

    “Such is Allaah, your Lord; His is the kingdom. And those, 
    whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmeer (the 
    thin membrane over the date stone).
If you invoke (or call 
    upon) them, they hear not your call; and if (in case) they were to hear, 
    they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on the Day of 
    Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them. And none can inform 
    you (O Muhammad) like Him Who is the All-Knower (of everything)”
    [Faatir 35:13-14 – interpretation of the meaning] 

    So He calls their prayers to others shirk. 

    And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And who is more astray 
    than one who calls on (invokes) besides Allaah, such as will not answer him 
    till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls 
    (invocations) to them? 
And when mankind are 
    gathered (on the Day of Resurrection), they (false deities) will become 
    their enemies and will deny their worshipping”
[al-Ahqaaf 46:6] 

    So Allaah tells us that those who are called upon other than 
    Him, the Prophets and the righteous, are unaware of the call of those who 
    call upon them and will never respond to their calls, and they will be their 
    enemies and will deny their worship of them.  

    And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Do they attribute as 
    partners to Allaah those who created nothing but they themselves are 
    created?
No help can they give 
    them, nor can they help themselves.
And if you call them to 
    guidance, they follow you not. It is the same for you whether you call them 
    or you keep silent.
Verily, those whom you 
    call upon besides Allaah are slaves like you. So call upon them and let them 
    answer you if you are truthful”
[al-A’raaf 7:191-194] 
“And whoever invokes (or 
    worships), besides Allaah, any other ilaah (god), of whom he has no proof; 
    then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely, Al-Kaafiroon (the 
    disbelievers in Allaah and in the Oneness of Allaah, polytheists, pagans, 
    idolaters) will not be successful”
[al-Mu’minoon 23:117]

     So Allaah tells us that whoever calls upon anyone other than 
    Allaah, among the dead etc., will never succeed because of his kufr and his 
    calling upon someone other than Allaah.",Islam Q&A
34576,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34576,Freemasonry and ruling on joining the Masons,"What is Freemasonry, and what is the ruling on it in Islam? What is the ruling on joining the Masons?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Freemasonry is a secret political society whose goal is to 
    put an end to all religions and good morals, and to replace them with 
    man-made laws and non-religious systems. It strives to provoke ongoing 
    revolutions and to replace one regime with another, on the basis of its call 
    for freedom of thought and freedom of belief. This is what they have stated 
    clearly.  

    This is what was announced by one of them in the Students’ 
    Conference held in 1865 CE in the city of Liege which is considered to be 
    one of the centers of Freemasonry. He said: 

    Man must prevail over God, and declare war on Him. He should 
    demolish the heavens and tear them like paper. 

    It says in the Masonic Grand Lodge (1922, p. 98): We will 
    strengthen the freedom of individual thought with all the powers at our 
    disposal, and we will declare war against the real enemy of man, which is 
    religion. 

    The Masons say that Masonry takes the human soul as its 
    object of worship. 

    They say:  It is not enough for us to prevail over the 
    religious people and their places of worship, rather our basic goal is to 
    wipe them out of existence. 

    Minutes of the World Masonic Conference, 1903 CE, p. 102. 

    They say: Freemasonry will take the place of religion and its 
    Lodges will take the place of places of worship… and there are many other 
    statements which clearly point to the intensity of their enmity towards 
    religion and their uncompromising war on religion. 

    The Freemasons are one of the most ancient secret societies 
    which still exist and its origins are still unknown to many people and are 
    still unknown to many of their members, because the plots of their leaders 
    are very secret and hidden and they are so keen to conceal their plots and 
    aims. Therefore most of their affairs are conducted verbally, with no 
    written record. 

    When they want to write an idea or announce it to the public, 
    it is first subjected to the scrutiny of Masonic censors who decide whether 
    it may be released or not.  The foundations of Freemasonry were based on 
    theories taken from several sources, mostly from Jewish traditions. 

    This is supported by the fact that Jewish ideas and teachings 
    were taken as the basis for the founding of the Grand Lodge in 1717 CE with 
    its principles and symbols. The Masons still venerate the Jew Hiram and the 
    temple that he built, from which they take the design of the Masonic lodges 
    in the world. The greatest Masonic leaders are Jews and form the backbone of 
    the Masonic movement, and they are the ones who represent Jewish 
    organizations in Masonic lodges. It is to them that the spread of Masonry 
    and global cooperation between Freemasons is to be attributed. They are the 
    driving force behind Freemasonry and this Jewish elite are leading different 
    secret cells, running their affairs and directing them secretly as they 
    wish. This is supported by a report in the Masonic Acacia magazine 
    (1908, issue no. 66) which says that there is no Masonic lodge that is free 
    of Jews and that all the Jews do not follow one way or another exclusively, 
    rather there are only principles for them to follow. And this is also the 
    case with the Masons. Hence the Jewish synagogues are our [Masons’] support 
    and we find many Jews among the Freemasons. 

    This is also supported by what it says in the Masonic 
    publications: that the Jews are certain that the best means of destroying 
    religion is Freemasonry. The history of the Masons is similar to the history 
    of the Jews in belief. Their symbol is the six-pointed Star of David. The 
    Jews and the Freemasons both consider themselves to be the spiritual sons of 
    the builders of the Temple of Solomon. The Freemasonry which distorts other 
    religions lends full support to Judaism and its followers. The Jews took 
    advantage of people’s simple-mindedness and good intentions, and infiltrated 
    Freemasonry and reached high positions within it, thus they breathed a 
    Jewish spirit into the Masonic lodges and subjugated them to their own 
    aims. 

    One of the clearest indications of their intense desire to 
    conceal their plans to destroy religions and provoke political revolutions 
    is what it says in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, where it says: we 
    will concentrate these cells under a single leadership that is known to us 
    alone. This leadership will be composed of our scholars and these cells will 
    have special representatives, so that the true location of our leadership 
    will be concealed. This leadership alone will have the right to decide who 
    will speak, and to draw up the plans of the day. In these cells we will plan 
    to lay traps for all the socialists and classes of revolutionary society. 
    Most of the secret political plans are known to us and we will decide when 
    to implement them. But the agents of the international secret police will be 
    members of these cells. When the conspiracies start throughout the world, 
    that will mean that one of our most dedicated agents will be at the head of 
    these conspiracies and of course we will be the only people to direct the 
    Masonic plans. We are the only people who know how to direct them and we 
    know the ultimate goal of each action, whilst the illiterates – meaning 
    non-Jews – are ignorant of most of these things, especially Masonry, and 
    they can only see the immediate results of what they are doing. 

    And there is other evidence which points to the strong 
    connection between the Jews and the Masons, and the cooperation between the 
    two parties in revolutionary conspiracies and stirring up destructive 
    movements. Even though Freemasonry outwardly appears to be a call to freedom 
    of belief, tolerance and social reform in general, in fact it is really a 
    call for permissiveness and destructive factors which cause social 
    disintegration and the loosening of bonds between nations and destruction of 
    religion and morals and the spread of mischief. 

    Based on this, any Muslim who joins a Masonic group knowing 
    the true nature of Freemasonry and its secrets, and carries out its rituals 
    and is keen to do so, is a kaafir who should be asked to repent. If he 
    repents, all well and good, otherwise he is to be put to death and if he 
    dies in that state then his recompense will be that of the kaafirs. Whoever 
    joins the Freemasons but does not know what they really are, or know about 
    their plots against Islam and the Muslims, and their spreading evil and the 
    evil that they are planning against everyone who tries to bring people 
    together and reform nations, and he joins them in their general activities 
    and talk that does not apparently contradict Islam, is not a kaafir, rather 
    he is excused in general because of their concealing their true nature from 
    him, and because he does not share their basic beliefs or aims. The Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Acts are but by 
    intentions, and each man will have but that which he intended.” 

    But he must disavow himself of them when he finds out what 
    they really are, and he must tell people about their real nature and strive 
    to spread their secrets and their plots against the Muslims, so that this 
    will cause a scandal for them and will undermine their efforts. The Muslim 
    should surround himself with good people who will cooperate with him in his 
    religious and worldly affairs. He should be far-sighted in choosing close 
    friends so that he will be safe from being tempted by these apparently 
    attractive ideas and  be safe from the evil consequences of honeyed words, 
    and so he will not fall into the traps of the people of shirk which they set 
    up to ensnare those who are easily deceived, follow their whims and desires 
    and are weak in reasoning.

    determined of people. He is well known for his courage and bravery. He was the first youth to enter Islam, then he stayed close to the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) before the Hijrah. When the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) left Makkah, 
    accompanied by Abu Bakr, he stayed behind and slept in the Prophet’s bed (thus fooling the mushrikeen who wanted to kill the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him)). Among his virtues are those mentioned in the hadeeth narrated by Sahl ibn Sa’d (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him), who said that he heard the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, on the day of Khaybar, “I will give the flag to a 
    man at whose hands Allaah will grant victory.” They got up, wishing to see to whom the flag would be given, each of them hoping that he would be 
    given the flag. Then he said, “Where is ‘Ali?” He was told that he was suffering from eye-trouble. He ordered that ‘Ali should be called to him, 
    then he spat in his eyes and he was healed immediately, as if he has never had any problem in his eyes. 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2942; Muslim, 2406. 
Just as ‘Ali had many virtues and good characteristics, other Sahaabah also had other 
    virtues and good characteristics.  Among the virtues of Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) is that which was narrated from Abu Sa’eed 
    al-Khudri, who said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) delivered a khutbah and said: “Allaah has given a slave the 
    choice between this world and what is with Him, and he chose what is with Him.” Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with him) began to 
    weep, and I said to myself, “What is making this old man cry if Allaah has given a slave the choice between this world and what is with Him, and 
    he chose what is with Him?” The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was that slave, and Abu Bakr was the most 
    knowledgeable of us. He said, “O Abu Bakr, do not weep. Abu Bakr has favoured me greatly with his companionship and his wealth. If I were to have 
    taken a close friend among my ummah, I would have chosen Abu Bakr, but the brotherhood of Islam is sufficient. Do not leave any door to the mosque 
    without closing it off, apart from the door of Abu Bakr.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 466; Muslim, 2382 
Another of his virtues is that he accompanied the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) during the Hijrah (migration to Madeenah), as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“If you help him (Muhammad) not (it does not matter), for Allaah did indeed help 
    him when the disbelievers drove him out, the second of the two; when they (Muhammad and Abu Bakr) were in the cave, he said to his companion (Abu 
    Bakr): ‘Be not sad (or afraid), surely, Allaah is with us.’ Then Allaah sent down His Sakeenah (calmness, tranquillity, peace) upon him, and 
    strengthened him with forces (angels) which you saw not, and made the word of those who disbelieved the lowermost, while the Word of Allaah that 
    became the uppermost; and Allaah is All-Mighty, All-Wise”
    [al-Tawbah 9:40]
And ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) appointed him as the commander of the army of Dhaat 
    al-Salaasil. He said: So I came to him and said, “Which of the people is dearest to you?” He said, “ ‘Aa’ishah.” I said, “Who among men?” He said, 
    “Her father.” I said, “Then who?” He said, “Then ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab,” and he mentioned some other men. 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3662; 
    Muslim, 2384. 
Another of his virtues is the fact 
    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) appointed him to lead the prayers in his stead at the end of his life, when he 
    fell sick with his final illness, and he rebuked those who objected to this and said, “Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 683; 
    Muslim 418.  
And it was narrated from Anas ibn 
    Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) climbed Uhud with Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and 
    ‘Uthmaan, and it trembled beneath them. He said, ‘Stand firm, O Uhud, for there is no one on you but a Prophet, a Siddeeq and two martyrs.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3675. 
With regard to ‘Umar ibn 
    al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him), he also had many virtues and good characteristics which were proven in many reports. For example it 
    was narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “Whilst I was sleeping, I saw the people were shown to me, and they were wearing shirts. Some shirts came down to the chest, and some 
    were shorter than that. ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab was shown to me and he was wearing a shirt that dragged along the ground.” They said, “How did you 
    interpret that, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “Religious commitment.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 23; 
    Muslim, 2390.  
It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah 
    ibn ‘Umar said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “Whilst I was sleeping, a cup of milk was 
    brought to me and I drank until I saw its wetness coming out of my nails. Then I gave the rest to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab.” They said, “How did you 
    interpret that, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “(It is) knowledge.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 82; 
    Muslim, 2391. 
And it was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah 
    (may Allaah be pleased with her) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to say, “Among the nations who came before 
    you there were muhaddathoon (men who were inspired) and if there are any such men among my ummah, then ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab is one of them.” 
Narrated by Muslim, 2398 
And there is other evidence which 
    points to the virtues of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them). But the fact that some of them were superior to others is something that 
    makes sense and is proven in sharee’ah.  It is not the matter of whims and desires, rather it should be referred to sharee’ah, as Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And your Lord creates 
    whatsoever He wills and chooses, no choice have they (in any matter). Glorified is Allaah, and exalted above all that they associate (as partners 
    with Him)”
[al-Qasas 28:68]
So we should refer to the shar’i 
    evidence in order to find out the status of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them). It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) said: “We used to compare the people as to who was better at the time of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him). We used to regard Abu Bakr as the best, then ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, then ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan (may Allaah be pleased with them).” 
    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3655. According to another report he said: “At the time of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    we did not regard anyone as equal with Abu Bakr, then ‘Umar, then ‘Uthmaan, then we left the companions of the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) and we did not differentiate between them.” Al-Bukhaari, 2679. 
This is testimony of all the 
    Sahaabah, narrated by ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar, that Abu Bakr was superior to all the Sahaabah, followed by ‘Umar, then ‘Uthmaan. 
Now let us turn to ‘Ali ibn Abi 
    Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him) himself, and he see what he said. It was narrated that Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah (who was the son of ‘Ali 
    ibn Abi Taalib) said: “I said to my father, ‘Which of the people was the best after the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him)?’ He said, ‘Abu Bakr.’ I said, ‘Then who?’ He said, ‘Then ‘Umar.’ I was afraid that he would say ‘Uthmaan. I said, ‘Then is it you?’ He 
    said, ‘I am only one of the Muslims.’” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3671. 
It was narrated that ‘Ali (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him) said: “No one is brought to me who regards me as superior to Abu Bakr and ‘Umar but I will punish him with a beating 
    like a fabricator.” Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: It was narrated that he used to speak from the minbar of Kufa and say that the best of this 
    ummah after our Prophet was Abu Bakr, then ‘Umar. This was narrated from him via more than eighty isnaads, and it was narrated by al-Bukhaari and 
    others. Hence the earlier Shi’ah all used to agree that Abu Bakr and ‘Umar were superior, as has been mentioned by more than one. Manhaaj 
    al-Sunnah, 1/308 
It was narrated from Abu Juhayfah that ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) ascended 
    the minbar and praised and glorified Allaah and sent blessings upon the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then he said: 
    “The best of this ummah after its Prophet is Abu Bakr. The second is ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him), and after that, whoever Allaah wants 
    to be good will be good.” 
Narrated by Imam Ahmad in his 
    Musnad, 839. And Shaykh Shu’ayb al-Arna’oot said: its isnaad is qawiy.  
These ahaadeeth of the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and these reports from the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) all testify to the belief of Ahl 
    al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah, amongst whom there is no dispute concerning it, that the best of this ummah after its Prophet is Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him), then ‘Umar. May Allaah be pleased with all of the Sahaabah. 
With regard to the idea that Abu 
    Bakr and ‘Umar always used to ask ‘Ali questions and that they did not have knowledge, this is not proven in any report whatsoever. Rather it is 
    proven that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ordered that Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) should lead the 
    people in prayer when he was sick with his final illness. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would not have delegated 
    this task except to one who had knowledge of the rulings on the prayer. And it was proven that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) appointed Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) to lead the Hajj before the Farewell Pilgrimage, and the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) would not have appointed a man to such a position unless he was the most knowledgeable of them concerning it (the 
    Hajj). Indeed it is narrated that ‘Ali learned some ahaadeeth from Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with them both) concerning some issues. It was 
    narrated that Asma’ bint al-Hakam al-Fazaari said: “I heard ‘Ali say: I was a man who, if I heard a hadeeth from the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), Allaah would benefit me thereby as much as He willed to benefit me. If a man from among his 
    companions told me a hadeeth I would ask him to swear to it; if he swore to it then I would believe him.” He told me that Abu Bakr said, and Abu 
    Bakr spoke the truth, “I heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, ‘There is no man who commits a sin 
    then he gets up and purifies himself and prays, and seeks the forgiveness of Allaah, but Allaah will forgive him.’ Then he recited this verse 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who, when they have 
    committed Faahishah (illegal sexual intercourse) or wronged themselves with evil, remember Allaah and ask forgiveness for their sins; — and none 
    can forgive sins but Allaah — and do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:135]
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 406; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
Al-Tirmidhi (3682) narrated from 
    ‘Ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah has placed truth on the tongue of ‘Umar and 
    in his heart.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2908. 
And we have quoted above the words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) concerning ‘Umar: “Among the nations who came before you there were muhaddathoon (men who were inspired) and if there are any such 
    men among my ummah, then ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab is one of them.” 
The point is that the belief of Ahl 
    al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah, on which they are unanimously agreed, is that the best of this ummah after its Prophet is Abu Bakr, then ‘Umar – may 
    Allaah be pleased with them both. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him) said: “No one among the respectable Muslim scholars has said that ‘Ali was more knowledgeable or had more understanding 
    of Islam than Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, or even than Abu Bakr alone. Those who claim that there is consensus on that are among the most ignorant of 
    people and the greatest liars. Rather, more than one of the scholars have stated that there is scholarly consensus that Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq was 
    more knowledgeable than ‘Ali, such as Imam Mansoor ibn ‘Abd al-Jabbaar al-Sam’aani al-Marwadhi, one of the leading scholars of the Sunnah among 
    the companions of al-Shaafa’i, who mentioned in his book Taqweem al-Adillah ‘ala’l-Imam that there was consensus among the scholars of the 
    Sunnah that Abu Bakr was more knowledgeable than ‘Ali. I do not know of anyone among the famous imams who disputes this point. How could it be 
    otherwise when Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq used to issue rulings and commands and prohibitions, and pass judgements, and deliver khutbahs in the presence 
    of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as he used to do when he and Abu Bakr would go out to call the people to Islam, 
    and when they migrated together, and on the day of Hunayn, and on other occasions, when the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) remained silent and approved of what Abu Bakr said; no one else enjoyed such status. When the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) consulted with the wise and knowledgeable men among his companions, he would consult Abu Bakr and ‘Umar first, because they were the 
    first to speak about matters of Islam in the presence of the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) before the rest of his 
    companions; for example when he consulted them about the prisoners of Badr, the first ones who spoke about that were Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, and this 
    also happened on other occasions… In Saheeh Muslim it is narrated that the companions of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) were with him on a journey and he said: “If the people obey Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, they will be guided aright.” And it was narrated from 
    Ibn ‘Abbaas that he used to give his fatwas based on the Book of Allaah, and if he could not find anything then he would look at the Sunnah of the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then if he could not find anything he would refer to the fatwas of Abu Bakr 
    and ‘Umar, then if he did not find anything he would refer to the fatwas of ‘Uthmaan and ‘Ali – and Ibn ‘Abbaas was the habr al-ummah 
    (scholar of the ummah) and the most knowledgeable of the Sahaabah of his time, and he would consult the words of Abu Bakr and ‘Umar and give them 
    precedence over the words of anyone else among the Sahaabah. And it was proven that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    prayed for Ibn ‘Abbaas and said, “O Allaah, cause him to understand the religion of Islam and teach him the correct interpretation (of the 
    Qur’aan).”

    and text. If there is someone in the isnaad who is a liar, then it is a fabricated hadeeth. With regard to the text, this can also indicate that a 
    hadeeth is fabricated but in most cases the person studying the hadeeth needs to have experience and knowledge of the saheeh (sound) hadeeths of 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
Imam Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on 
    him) said: 
I was asked: is it possible to recognize a 
    fabricated hadeeth by following guidelines without looking at its isnaad? 
This is a very serious question. That may be known to one who has deep knowledge of the saheeh 
    Sunnahs, for whom it has become second nature and who is extremely specialized in the knowledge of the Sunnah, and reports, and has knowledge of 
    the Seerah (biography) of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his teachings, commands and prohibitions, 
    what he told of, what he called people to, what he liked and what he disliked, and what he prescribed for his ummah, so that it is as if he mixed 
    with the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) like one of his companions. Such a person will have knowledge of the 
    life, teachings and words of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and what he could have said and could not 
    have said, in a way that others will not know. This is the way of every follower and the one whom he follows, because the one who becomes close to 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and is very keen to find out about what he said and did, becomes more able to 
    distinguish what may correctly be attributed to him from what is not correct, in a way that those who do not have such knowledge cannot do. This 
    is the way of followers with their imams: they know their words, texts and points of view.

Everything was fine until my sister suddenly said that she does not want to live with her husband because she no longer loves him. They have not lived together in their house as husband and wife. When her husband heard her say this he got very angry and refused to divorce her. My sister is insisting that she does not want to live with him and he is insisting that he will not divorce her. We have told her that she cannot get divorced without a legitimate shar’i reason and proof, but she says that he gets angry quickly, and discloses secrets. It should be noted that she has not yet lived with him in the same house. Her husband admits that and says that he will change. What is the shar’i solution to this difficult problem?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If the husband is giving his wife her rights 
    as prescribed in sharee’ah, then it is haraam for her to ask him for a divorce, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “Any woman who asked for a divorce for no reason, the fragrance of Paradise is forbidden to her.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1187; Abu 
    Dawood, 2226; Ibn Maajah, 2055; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood). 
What is meant by the words “for no reason” is without any urgent situation which makes it hard 
    for the marriage to continue.  
If the wife is being harmed and the situation 
    is too difficult for her because of the husband’s falling short in giving her her rights, or his withholding her rights from her, or because of 
    his bad treatment and other similar reasons, then she has the right to ask for divorce, and she may refer to the qaadi and tell him what is 
    happening, and he in turn can ask the husband to give her her rights or to divorce her.  
If she has found out that he has some bad 
    characteristics, he should not hasten to ask for a divorce, rather she has to be kind to him and advise him in the way that is best, and help him 
    to change his character for the better. He acknowledges the way he is and has promised to change. This is a positive step on the husband’s part 
    and it is the first step in dealing with the problem. The wife should help her husband to do good. If every wife wanted a divorce when he was 
    quick to get angry or transmitted some words that were spoken between him and his wife, or other mistakes, there would be no household that was 
    not broken up and its members scattered.

When ‘Umar wore it and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw him, he said to him: “I gave it to you so that you could give it to someone as a gift, not so that you could wear it.” So ‘Umar gave it to one of the people who had been his friends during the Jaahiliyyah, or some such. Is what he says correct? If it is correct, can this be used as an analogy to permit the sale of cigarettes and tobacco, and women’s pants, and men’s and women’s swimsuits, although Allaah says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning): “Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression” [al-Maa’idah 5:2]. Please explain, because there cannot be any contradiction between the Qur’aan and Sunnah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This hadeeth was narrated by al-Bukhaari, Muslim and others in several places and with several isnaads, such as the report narrated by al-Bukhaari in the chapter on trade (tijaarah), concerning what it is makrooh for men and women to wear, via Saalim ibn ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar from his father who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent to ‘Umar a hullah (two piece suit) made of silk, and he saw it on him (i.e., saw him wearing it). He said: “I did not send it to you for you to wear it, for it is worn by one who has no share in the Hereafter. Rather I sent it to you so that you can benefit from it” – i.e., sell it. This hadeeth indicates that it is permissible to deal in clothes that we are permitted to use in one way but not in another, and it is permissible to give them as gifts and donations, but the one to whom it is given or donated has to use it the manner which is permitted, not in the manner that is forbidden. For example: 
Gold jewellery, weapons, knives, grapes, etc, which can be used in permissible ways or in haraam ways. It is permissible to deal in them and to give them as donations and gifts, so long as the one who buys them or is given them will use them in permissible ways, such as selling them, giving them, etc, and he will not make use of them in haraam ways. 
But if the thing is something which it is haraam to use in any way and under any circumstances, then it is not permissible to deal in it or to give it as a gift, such as pigs, lions and wolves. There is nothing in the hadeeth to indicate that it is permissible to sell the things mentioned, so it is not correct to draw an analogy between selling cigarettes, tobacco, and men’s and women’s bathing suits, and selling things that may be used in some ways but not others or in some situations and not others, because it is haraam to use these things in all cases.

All he knew was that her vision was weak, and he got married to her. Now he is wondering whether he should separate from her because he feels that she will not be able to raise his children properly if she has children.

 He is always arguing with her mother because she speaks badly to him and he thinks that she bewitched him to make him marry her daughter. Now he cannot control his anger most of the time and he beats his wife, and he insults her in horrible terms. I hope you can suggest what is best for them.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    What you have mentioned about her suffering from retinal 
    atrophy is not one of the faults which the fuqaha’ have stated give the 
    husband the choice of annulling the marriage. But some scholars, such as 
    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, and Ibn al-Qayyim – and Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen 
    who regarded it as being the correct view – narrated that every fault which 
    puts the other spouse off, so that the purposes of marriage, namely 
    compassion and love, cannot be achieved, mean that the spouse has the choice 
    of annulling the marriage. (Zaad al-Ma’aad, 5/163) 

    Based on this, the choice of annulment is given in every case 
    where there is a fault that affects the purposes of marriage, namely love, 
    intimacy, bearing children, etc. 

    But your brother came to know of this fault after that, and 
    he did things which indicate that he accepted that, namely continuing to be 
    intimate with her and not hastening to annul the marriage. According to the 
    fuqaha’ this indicates that he accepts it, and that he does not have the 
    right to annul the marriage. 

    But as you know, divorce is the man’s right and he may 
    divorce his wife if he thinks that he cannot live a good life with her and 
    that he cannot feel love for her and feel at ease with her, which is the 
    basis of marriage. 

    What we advise in such situations is to be patient with this 
    wife and try to solve the problem. If her mother is the main reason for the 
    problems, then it is better to keep a distance from her and to live in 
    separate accommodation. If your brother lives in the same house as her or 
    nearby, then it is sufficient to keep in touch by phone and pay brief 
    visits, etc. If the wife’s bad attitude is the reason for the problem, then 
    your brother should check himself and how he treats his wife, for the way he 
    treats her, beating her and calling her names, may be the reason for her bad 
    attitude. He should seek the help of people who have experience in dealing 
    with such problems, and try different ways of finding a solution to each 
    problem. 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“If you dislike them, it 
    may be that you dislike a thing and Allaah brings through it a great deal of 
    good”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:19]

This is like when a person is hired to do some construction work or the like; there is nothing wrong with him hiring someone else to do the actual work, but that is subject to two conditions: 
-1- 
The institution should not have stipulated in its contract that the person hired must do the work himself and must not sell it to a third party, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Muslims are bound by their conditions.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 359; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
The Standing Committee was asked about someone who rented a building for 100,000 and sublet it for 150,000 – is that permissible? 
They replied: 
Whoever rents a building may sublet it to someone else for the same price as that for which he rented it, or for more or less than that, and for the same time period as that agreed upon or less, not for more that may cause harm, because he has the right to make use of the thing that he has rented. Therefore it is permissible for him to make use of it himself or let someone else make use of it, unless the owner has stipulated that the renter may not transfer it to someone else, or he may not rent it to those who practice certain professions or occupations, in which case they are both bound by the conditions that they have agreed upon. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Question: If a person is hired to do a certain job, such as if it is said, ‘We want you to clean this house every day, and we will give you one hundred riyals each month,’ then he hires someone to clean the house each month but for fifty riyals, is that permissible or not? 
Answer: Yes, that is permissible. This is like saying that it is permissible to rent what’s left of a lease for more than what one has paid in rent. This is what people do nowadays, for example we see that the government has an agreement with a company to clean the mosques, so each mosque is cleaned in return for a certain amount of money, then this company gives the workers who do the work agreed upon in the contract less than one-quarter of what the company has agreed upon with the government. ... 
For example: I hired a man to copy Zaad al-Mustaqni’ (a book of fiqh) for me, and I knew that this man’s handwriting was excellent and that he makes few mistakes, then he hired a man to write it for less than I had hired him, and the handwriting of the man who was hired by the one whom I had hired was beautiful. But the scholars say that this is not permissible. 
Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/327 
That is because what matters when it comes to copying books is not that the handwriting should be beautiful, rather what matters is both beautiful handwriting and attention to the rules of spelling and placement of diacritical marks, etc.

Is it permissible for us Muslims to mix with them and eat their food if they invite us? Is it permissible for us to accept their donations from this wealth for the mosque?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: You have to advise them and warn them of the evil 
    consequences of dealing in haraam things and acquiring wealth from haraam 
    sources.  You should cooperate with your brothers among the righteous to 
    remind them and warn them of the wrath of Allaah and the severity of His 
    punishment of those who disobey Him and wage war against Him by committing 
    haraam actions. You should teach them that the pleasures of this world are 
    few, and that the Hereafter is better and more lasting. If they respond, 
    then praise be to Allaah. In that case they are your brothers in Islam. Then 
    you should advise them to return that which they took wrongfully to its 
    rightful owners, if they know who they are, and to follow their bad deeds 
    with good deeds, so that Allaah will accept their repentance and turn their 
    bad deeds into good deeds. Then it will be permissible for you to mix with 
    them as your brothers in faith, and to eat their food and accept their 
    donations for building and furnishing the mosque etc., because by repenting 
    and returning to people what is rightfully theirs as much as possible, their 
    previous sins will be forgiven, as Allaah says (interpretation of the

    “So 
    whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord 
    and stops eating Ribaa, shall not be punished for the past; his case is for 
    Allaah (to judge)”

    Secondly: 
If they still refuse to 
    heed advice and reminders, and they persist in doing haraam things, then you 
    have to forsake them for the sake of Allaah, and not respond to their

    yourself from the meeqaat which you are going to pass, then when you have completed ‘Umrah for yourself, by doing tawaaf and saa’i and cutting 
    your hair, go out to al-Tan’eem or another place outside the Haram (sanctuary), and enter ihraam for ‘Umrah on behalf of your father. Say, “Labbayk 
    Allaahumma bi ‘umratin ‘an abi (Here I am, O Allaah, for ‘Umrah on behalf of my father).” Then do tawaaf and saa’i, and cut your hair or shave 
    your head, but shaving is better. You do not have to go back to the meeqaat to enter ihraam for ‘Umrah on behalf of your father. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz said: 
If you want to do Hajj or ‘Umrah for yourself 
    or for someone else who has passed away or who is unable to do it because they are very old or suffering from an incurable sickness, then you have 
    to enter ihraam from the meeqaat which you pass when you are intending to do Hajj or ‘Umrah. When you finish the actions of ‘Umrah or Hajj, there 
    is nothing wrong with you starting ‘Umrah for yourself from the closest point outside the Haram, such as al-Tan’eem or al-Ji’raanah or elsewhere. 
    You do not need to go back to the meeqaat, because ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) entered ihraam for ‘Umrah from the meeqaat of 
    Madeenah with the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) during the Farewell Pilgrimage, then when she finished her Hajj and 
    ‘Umrah she asked the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) permission to do ‘Umrah on its own, and he told her brother ‘Abd 
    al-Rahmaan to take her to al-Tan’eem, and she did ‘Umrah after Hajj. He did not tell her to go back to the meeqaat. She had joined Hajj with the 
    ‘Umrah for which she had entered ihraam from the meeqaat as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told her to do, when she 
    began to menstruate before she could do the rituals of ‘Umrah. 
And Allaah is the Source of strength.

34597,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34597,Ruling on repairing machines that are usually used for haram purposes,"Is repairing TVs, tape recorders, VCRs and receivers halal or haram?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.These machines may be used for permissible purposes, or they may be used for haram purposes, which is what usually happens, such as watching pictures of women who are clothed yet naked, or listening to music. 
Hence it is not permissible to repair them unless that is done for one whom it is known or is thought most likely will use them for permissible purposes. But if it is known or is thought most likely that a person will use them for haram purposes, it is not permissible to help him to fix his machine. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Severe in punishment”
[al-Maa'idah 5:2]
The Standing Committee For Issuing Fatwas was asked the following question: 
I work as an electronic engineer, and part of my work is fixing radios, TVs, VCRs and the like. I hope that you can advise me as to whether I should continue in this work, knowing that if I do not do this work I will miss out on a lot of experience and the profession for which I have been studying all my life, and I may suffer a lot of harm because of not doing this. 
They replied: 
The evidence of sharee’ah, from the Quran and Sunnah, indicates that the Muslim must strive to find a good source of income. So you have to look for work where your income will be good (i.e., halal). As for earning a living from the work that you mention, this is not good, because these machines are usually used for haram purposes.
