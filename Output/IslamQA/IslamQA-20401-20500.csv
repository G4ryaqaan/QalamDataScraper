20406,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20406,When is it permissible to beat the daff?,"This question is about the instrument called ""the duff"". This is, I believe the only instrument that was made halal for muslims to listen to. Recently I have read that there are restrictions to listening to it, such as, only women can liten to it, it should only be played at weddings and 'Eid and that in all other circumstances it is Haram. The places where I read this didn't really have any proofs or evidences. Are these true restructions and are there any more?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Al-Bukhaari narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There will be among my ummah people who will regard adultery, silk, alcohol and musical instruments as permissible.” 
This hadeeth indicates that all musical instruments are haraam, including the daff. 
‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The daff is haraam, stringed instruments are haraam, drums are haraam and flutes are haraam. Narrated by al-Bayhaqi, 10/222 
But there are some ahaadeeth which indicate that it is permissible to beat the daff in some circumstances, which are: 
Eid, weddings, and when one who has been away returns. 
The evidence is given below. 
1 – It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah that Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) entered upon her and there were two girls with her during the days of Mina beating the daff, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was covering himself with his garment. Abu Bakr rebuked them, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) uncovered his face and said, “Leave them alone, O Abu Bakr, for these are the days of Eid.” That was during the days of Mina. 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 944; Muslim, 892 
2 – It was narrated that al-Rubayyi’ bint Mu’awwidh ibn ‘Afra’ said: “After the consummation of my marriage, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came and sat on my bed as far from me as you are sitting now, and our little girls started beating the daff and reciting verses mourning my father, who had been killed in the battle of Badr. One of them said, ‘Among us is a Prophet who knows what will happen tomorrow.’ On that the Prophet said, ‘Omit this (saying) and keep on saying the verses which you had been saying before.’” 
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4852). 
3 – It was narrated that Buraydah said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went out on one of his military campaigns, and when he came back, a black slave woman came and said, “O Messenger of Allaah, I vowed that if Allaah brought you back safe and sound, I would beat the daff before you and sing. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “If you vowed that, then do it, otherwise do not do it.’” So she started to beat the daff, and Abu Bakr came in whilst she was doing so. Then ‘Ali came in whilst she was beating the daff, then ‘Uthmaan came in whilst she was beating the daff, then ‘Umar came in and she threw the daff beneath her and sat on it. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “The Shaytaan is afraid of you, O ‘Umar. I was sitting and she was beating the daff, then Abu Bakr came in when she was beating the daff; then ‘Ali came in when she was beating the daff; then ‘Uthmaan came in when she was beating the daff, but when you came in, O ‘Umar, she put the daff down.” 
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3690; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2913. 
These ahaadeeth indicate that it is permissible to beat the daff in these three situations. Apart from that, the principle remains that it is haraam. Some scholars made the matter broader and said that it is permissible to beat the daff when a child is born and when he is circumcised; others take the matter further and say that it is permissible on all occasions that are a cause for expressing joy, such as the recovery of a sick person and the like. 
See al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 38/169 
But it is better to limit ourselves to what was narrated in the text. And Allaah knows best. 
Secondly: 
The correct view is that it is not permissible to beat the daff except for women. If a man does that, he is imitating women, which is a major sin. 
Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah – may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
In general, it is a well known principle of the Islamic religion that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not prescribe that the righteous men, devoted worshippers and ascetics of this ummah should gather to listen to verses of poetry chanted to the accompaniment of handclapping, rhythm sticks or daffs. It is not permissible for anyone to go beyond the limits of Islam and follow something other than that which was narrated in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, whether that has to do with inward matters or outward, whether for the common man or the elite. But the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) granted a concession for some kinds of entertainment on the occasion of weddings and the like, and he also granted a concession to women allowing them to beat the daff at weddings and on other joyous occasions. But with regard to the men of his time, none of them used to beat the daff or clap his hands, rather it was proven in al-Saheeh that he said, ‘Clapping is for women, and Tasbeeh is for men,’ and he cursed women who imitate men and men who imitate women. 
Because singing, beating the daff and clapping the hands are actions of women, the salaf used to call a man who did that mukhannath (effeminate), and they used to call male singers makhaaneeth (pl. of mukhannath). This is well known. 
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 11/565, 566 
Ibn Hajar said: 
The strong (qawiy) ahaadeeth indicate that this is permissible for women, but that does not include men, because of the general meaning of the prohibition on men imitating women. 
Fath al-Baari, 9/226 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Rather the concession allowing women to use the daff is for them only. With regard to men, it is not permissible for them to do any of that, whether on weddings or on other occasions. Rather Allaah has prescribed for men to train in the instruments of war and skills needed for battle, such as shooting and horse riding, and competing in that. 
Majallat al-Jaami’ah al-Islamiyyah (Magazine of the Islamic University in al-Madeenah al-Munawwarah), 3rd edition, 2nd year, Muharram, 1390 AH, p. 185, 186 
And he also said: 
With regard to weddings, it is prescribed to beat the daff and sing regular songs which do not call for or praise anything that is haraam. This is to be done at night, by women only, to announce the wedding and to emphasize the difference between this legitimate marriage and zina (adultery) which is done in secret, as was narrated in the saheeh Sunnah from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).

20419,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20419,She made a promise to her Lord and wants to break it,"If someone want to break her promise,what shall she do?

The promise that she made it while she is angry at someone's else,but she promise to herselves and to ALLAH,now that after time she want to break those promise.

What shall she do for repent?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Making 
    a promise to Allaah is a kind of vow (nadhr). See question no. 38934. 

    Allaah 
    has commanded us to fulfil our promises and covenants, whether the promise is made to Allaah or to people. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    
    “And fulfil the Covenant of Allaah (Bay‘ah: pledge for Islam) when you have covenanted”

    
    [al-Nahl 16:91] 
“And of them are some who made a covenant with Allaah (saying): ‘If He bestowed on us of His 
    Bounty, we will verily, give Sadaqah (Zakaah and voluntary charity in Allaah’s Cause) and will be certainly among those who are righteous.’

    
     Then when He gave them of His Bounty, they became niggardly [refused to pay the Sadaqah (Zakaah or voluntary charity)], and turned away, averse.

    So 
    He punished them by putting hypocrisy into their hearts till the Day whereon they shall meet Him, because they broke that (covenant with Allaah) 
    which they had promised to Him and because they used to tell lies”

    [al-Tawbah 9:75]
This applies if what the person wants to do 
    is an act of worship, such as when a person makes a promise to his Lord that he will speak the truth or give some of his wealth in charity, etc. 
    This comes under the heading of vows (nadhr) even if the person does not actually use the word nadhr or vow.  The one who makes a promise to 
    Allaah or says, “I promise Allaah that I will do such and such” is obliged to fulfil it, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said: “Whoever vows to do an act of worship or obedience to Allaah, let him fulfil it, and whoever vows to do an act of disobedience 
    towards Allaah, let him not fulfil it.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6318. 
It is not permissible to fail to fulfill this 
    obligation, unless a person is unable to fulfil it at all, in which case he should offer kafaarat yameen (expiation for breaking a vow), because 
    of the hadeeth: “Whoever makes a vow and is unable to fulfil it, his expiation is kafaarat yameen.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 3322, from the hadeeth 
    of Ibn ‘Abbaas. Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath: Its narrators are thiqaat, but it was narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in a mawqoof report, which is 
    likely to be the case. 
Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni 
    (10/72): In conclusion: the one who vows to do an act of worship but is unable to do it, or was able to do it then became unable to do it, has to 
    offer kafaarat yameen. 
But if what the person wants to do is a sin, 
    then it is not permissible for him to fulfil his vow, such as if a person makes a promise to his Lord that he will not speak to his brother or 
    visit him, when there is no shar’i justification for that. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, according to the 
    hadeeth quoted above: “and whoever vows to do an act of disobedience towards Allaah, let him not fulfil it.”  
What is required in this case is repentance 
    to Allaah from making a promise to commit sin, and offering kafaarat yameen, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “There is no vow to commit sin, and its expiation is kafaarat yameen.” Narrated by Ahmad (2640); Abu Dawood (3290); al-Tirmidhi (1524); 
    al-Nasaa’i (3834); Ibn Maajah (2125). Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
Similarly if a person makes a promise to Allaah to do something, then he sees that something 
    else is better, such as if he wants to not treat a relative or friend well, or not spend on him, then he should not fulfil that, rather he should 
    refrain from it, whether that was a vow or an oath. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever swears an oath 
    then sees that something else is better than it, let him do that which is better and let him offer expiation for his oath.” Narrated by Muslim, 
    1650, from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him). 
The questioner does not mention the promise 
    that she made so that we can answer in more specific terms, but she can learn the ruling on what she has done from what we have said above.

20421,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20421,Is it permissible to rent from kaafirs?,"Is it permissible for a Muslim to rent property from a non-Muslim?  In the US, there are more non-Muslims than Muslims. Unfortunately, they hang crosses, display statues, in or on their property, etc.  We rented property to hold a wedding. The rooms we rented and will use have no haram images. However, the owners have things displayed in the building. These items make me uncomfortable but our community is large and Muslims have not yet established businesses for this purpose. We encounter the same problem in renting out an apartment.(We also see these images in public schools, hospitals, etc.)  The owner may display things on his part of the property but the tenant is free to display halal items on the portion they rent. I want this wedding to be an example to a people that have for the most part abandoned separate weddings. I cannot afford for it to be a bad example.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for a Muslim to rent 
    property from a non-Muslim; the same applies to all other permissible dealings, such as selling, buying, depositing items as security on loans and 
    others. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions used to do business with the Jews and others, and when the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died, his shield was deposited as security with a Jew for thirty saa’s of barley. 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2759. 
If the rented party hall is free from haraam 
    images, it does not matter if the owner puts any such thing or any other bad thing in his own private section. 
The Muslims should strive to get their own 
    place for such occasions, on condition that it be set up for segregation of men and women, and that it is not too far from a mosque, so that the 
    people can pray in congregation when the time for prayer comes. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on 
    him) was asked the following question: 
Those who live in kaafir countries, such as 
    America, Britain, etc, have dealings with the kuffaar. What is the ruling on that? 
The shaykh replied: 
When the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) died, his shield was deposited as security for a loan with a Jew. What is forbidden is to take them as close friends. As for 
    buying and selling, there is nothing wrong with that. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) bought some sheep from an 
    idolater and distributed them among his companions. Rather what is haraam is to take them as close friends, love them and support them against the 
    Muslims. But if a Muslim buys from them, sells to them, or deposits something with them, there is nothing wrong with that. The Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) even ate the food of the Jews, and their food is permissible as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The food (slaughtered cattle, eatable 
    animals) of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them”

20424,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20424,He did a marriage contract with a girl without the intention of getting married,"I married a girl a white marriagE,a marriage for a benifit,.legally,it was a right marriage because we wrote it in the ""ADOUL"",with witnesses and with her parents and mine.however,""anniya""was not to marry her truely but only to show that we are married in front of the law.Now after 5 years,we haven't been treating each other as married people,now we decided not to devorce but to stay as married people..this time we have ""anniya""..the question is : DO WE NEED AN OTHER MARRIAGE PAPER OR NOT.?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is no such thing as a so-called “white marriage”. Rather when there has been the 
    proposal and acceptance, then the marriage is real, even if one or both parties to the marriage contract was only joking or playing about. This is 
    the view of the Hanafis and Hanbalis, and it is the correct view according to the Maalikis, and the more correct view according to the Shaafa’is. 
(See Fath al-Qadeer, 3/199; 
    al-Mughni, 7/61; Kashshaaf al-Qinaa’, 5/40; Haashiyat al-Dasooqi, 2/221; Bulghat al-Saalik, 2/350; Nahaayat al-Muhtaaj, 
    6/209; Rawdat al-Taalibeen, 8/54). 
The evidence they quote for that is the words 
    of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “There are three things which if done in earnest they are valid and if done in 
    jest they are also valid: marriage (nikaah), divorce (talaaq) and taking back one's wife (after a first or second talaaq).” 
(Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2194; al-Tirmidhi, 
    11849; Ibn Maajah, 2039, from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him). Classed as hasan by al-Haafiz ibn Hajar in 
    al-Talkhees al-Habeer, 3/424, and by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 944). 
Jest refers to when what is meant by the words is something other than what is assumed. This 
    applies to what you have done, because you made the marriage contract even though you had no intention of being married. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him) said: “A divorce that is pronounced in jest takes effect according to the majority of scholars. By the same token, a marriage done 
    in jest is also valid, as is stated in the text of the marfoo’ hadeeth. This is what was narrated from the Sahaabah and Taabi’een, and it is also 
    the view of the majority of scholars.” 
Al-Fataawa al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kubra, 
    6/63. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
“In a mursal hadeeth narrated by al-Hasan from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) (it says): ‘Whoever does a marriage contract in jest or divorces in jest or frees a slave in jest, that is valid.’” 
‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) said: “There are four things which are valid if they are spoken: divorce, freeing a slave, marriage and vows.” 
Ameer al-Mu’mineen ‘Ali (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: “There are three things in which there should be no joking: divorce, freeing slaves and marriage.” 
Abu’l-Darda’ said: “There are three things in 
    which joking is like speaking seriously: divorce, freeing slaves and marriage.” 
Ibn Mas’ood said: “With regard to marriage, speaking seriously and joking are the same.” 
From I’laam al-Muwaqqi’een, 3/100 
Based on this, you do not have to renew the 
    marriage contract; your first contract remains valid.

    Bayt-Allaah il-Kareem (The Ancient History of Makkah and the Noble House of Allaah) by Muhammad Taahir al-Kurdi al-Makki (vol. 3, p. 256), it 
    says that the stone in the Yemeni Corner (al-Rukn al-Yamaani) goes back to the time when ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Zubayr (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) rebuilt the Ka’bah, and that it has remained until our own times, and that everyone who has rebuilt the Ka’bah kept this stone as it was. He 
    says that in 1040 AH, during the time of Sultan Murad IV, who rebuilt the Ka’bah, the edge of the stone of this Corner was broken off, and molten 
    lead was poured in its place, and before that the pieces of the stone had been put together, using adhesive and nails, during the era of the 
    Fatimids. 
Perhaps what you saw was that lead or the marks of 
    those nails, with changes in its colour because of perfume or being touched by the hands of people doing Tawaaf. 
What is prescribed is to touch this corner, 
    without kissing it or saying Allaahu akbar. If you cannot touch it then you should not point to it, because that was not narrated from the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).

The Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah

    touching it. 
Al-Sharh al-Mumti’,

Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said:

    hand in each circuit (of Tawaaf), but he should not kiss it. If it is not possible to touch it, then he should not point to it with his hand. 
Manaasik al-Hajj wa’l-‘Umrah, 
    p. 22 
Touching it is indicated by the hadeeth narrated by al-Haakim from Ibn ‘Umar, according to 
    which, when the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) circumambulated the Ka’bah (Tawaaf), he would touch the Black 
    Stone and the Yemeni Corner in each circuit.

Some of them recite half of Soorat al-Sajdah in the first rak’ah and half of Soorat al-Insaan in the second. Is what they do correct? Should we tell them that what they are doing is bid’ah (an innovation)?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We cannot say that what they are doing is bid’ah, but we can say that what they are doing is playing with the Sunnah. If they were really sincere about following the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) then let them do what he did. Hence Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) described people like this as ignorant imams. We say: If you are able to recite Soorat al-Sajdah in the first rak’ah and Soorat al-Insaan in the second, then do that. If you are not able to do that then recite another soorah so that you will not be dividing the Sunnah and toying with it. The Sunnah is known: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to recite Soorat al-Sajdah in the first rak’ah of Fajr on Friday and Soorat al-Insaan in the second rak’ah. So you should either do what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did, or recite another soorah, because dividing or separating what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did is going against the Sunnah and is undoubtedly toying with the Sunnah. Follow the guidance of your Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and be courageous, because if you recite Soorat al-Sajdah in the first rak’ah and Soorat al-Insaan in the second, some imams will say, “Why did you recite for so long? The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) got angry with Mu’aadh (may Allaah be pleased with him) and rebuked him for that.”

20455,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20455,Is it permissible for a man who has two wives to go to his first wife every day of the week?,"Is it permissable for a man with two wives to visit his first wife everyday of the week.  My husbands current arrangement is as follows. He comes to my home around twice a week, late in the evening after eshaa, and leaves before fajr, he takes my co-wife to work and takes their children to school.  He leaves me to take our children to school and get to work.  He repeats the same routine in the evening.  He goes to her house kicks he feet up lounges around and if he has no errands that involves their household he comes to my home late in the evening.

He designates no days for me and my children. He thinks that he can do what he wants during the day time, even if its with his other family as long as he comes to my home at night.  He spends the hole rammadaan at the masjid with her.  How can this be equal time, when their are seven days a week and he spends two nights (several hours) not days with me and the rest are at her home.  My husband is showing disregard for my rights.  His only justification is that because we don't get along he chooses to handle it the way he does.   

The situation has cause serious discord in our marriage, I don't really like him, their is no intimacy not because of me outright being disobedience towards him but because of hatred that I feel towards him for his outright disregard of my rights, and his preferential treatment towards my co-wife.  My husband takes this lightly and does not understand that hes driving me away from him.  I would like to divorce my husband because of the sins that I incur on myself because I can not be intimate with him under the current conditions because my husband doesn't fear Allah (swt) enough to make him see what he is doing is wrong and punishable on the day of Qiyammah so its not likely that he will change which is unaceptable to me.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah has permitted men to marry up to four 
    wives, because of the great interests achieved by that, which we cannot explain in detail here. But the matter is not left to the whims and 
    desires of men, rather it is subject to conditions and guidelines so that the purpose of plural marriage may be achieved. 
The problem that you are suffering from stems 
    from neglect of some of these rules and guidelines, namely neglect of the duty to divide one's time fairly among wives. The man is obliged to 
    share his time, night and day, equally among his wives. It is not permissible for him to spend more time with one of them, unless one of them 
    willingly gives up her time as a favour to the other. Otherwise it is not permitted at all.  Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and live with them honourably”
[al-Nisa’ 4:19]
Favouring one of the wives does not come under the heading of living with them honourably. 
    There follow some of the comments of the scholars which will explain this further. 
Al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said: The Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and the view of most of the Muslim scholars indicate that the man must divide his time, night and day, 
    among his wives, and must do so fairly. 
Al-Umm, 5/158. 
And he said: 
I do not know of any differing opinion concerning the fact that a man must share his time 
    equally among his wives. 
Al-Umm, 5/280. 
Al-Baghawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said: 
If a man has more than one wife, he must 
    share his time among them equally, if they are free woman [i.e., not slaves], whether they are Muslims or women of the people of the Book [Jewish 
    or Christian]… If he fails to share his time among them equally, then he has disobeyed Allaah and has to make up the time for the wife whom he has 
    wronged. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever has two wives and 
    inclines more towards one of them, he will come on the Day of Resurrection with half of his body leaning.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2/242; 
    al-Tirmidhi, 3/447; al-Nasaa’i, 7/64; Ibn Maajah, 1/633. classed as saheeh by Ibn Hajar in Buloogh al-Maraam, 3/310 and by al-Albaani in 
    Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 7/80). 
What is meant by this inclining has to do 
    with actions; he will not be brought to account for his heart being more inclined (towards one of his wives), if he treats them equally with 
    regard to the division of his time. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“You will never be able to do perfect justice 
    between wives even if it is your ardent desire, so do not incline too much to one of them”
[al-Nisa’ 4:129]
 What this means is that you will never be able to do perfect justice as far as what is in the 
    heart is concerned, so do not incline too much towards one of them, i.e., do not follow your whims and desires in your actions. 
Sharh al-Sunnah, 
    9/150-151. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:  
He is obliged to treat both wives equally 
    according to the consensus of the Muslims. In the four Sunans it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever has two wives…” So he is obliged to divide his time equally. If he stays overnight with one for one or two 
    or three nights, then he must stay overnight with the other for the same amount of time, and he should not favour one of them in the division of 
    his time. 
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 
    32/269. 
Ibn Qudaamah said: 
We do not know of any different opinion among 
    the scholars with regard to the obligation to share one's time equally among co-wives. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and live with them honourably”
[al-Nisa’ 4:19]
And there can be no honourable treatment when 
    one is more inclined towards one of them.
Al-Mughni, 
    8/138. 
Based on this, what your husband is doing by not dividing his time equally is a great sin in 
    the sight of Allaah. Allaah does not like wrongdoing or oppression, and he does not like those who do wrong. The fact that he thinks it is 
    permissible for him to go on the day allotted to you to his other wife is a mistaken notion.  
Shaykh Mansoor al-Bahooti said: 
“It is haraam for him to enter upon the one 
    whose turn it is not, at night except in case of necessity, and during the day except if there is some need. 
Al-Rawd al-Maraaba’ Sharh Zaad 
    al-Mustanqa’, 6/449. 
His justifying his actions by saying that you 
    do not get along with the first wife is another mistake, and cannot be solved by doing wrong to others. Rather he should adhere to the rulings of 
    sharee’ah in order to solve this matter, and should not do whatever he thinks is appropriate. What is the benefit of this action on his part? Will 
    it solve the problem, or just make matters worse?! 
With regard to your asking him for a divorce, 
    perhaps if you can be patient and put up with him, and also try to reform him, that will be better. You know that divorce is the last resort, 
    because of the many bad consequences that result from it. So you have to offer him a lot of sincere advice and remind him of Allaah, and that this 
    world is transient, and that tomorrow he will meet Allaah, so how will he answer Him about this blatant wrongdoing? 
You can also frighten him with the idea that 
    if this state of affairs continues, you may ask him for a divorce, and perhaps he will understand from that that you cannot put up with this 
    treatment that is not acceptable according to either sharee’ah or reason. You can also seek the help of wise people among your family and ask them 
    to speak to him about that. 
As well as being patient with you, you have 
    to strive hard in making du’aa’ sincerely asking Allaah to guide him and accept his repentance from that. 
With regard to your saying, “it’s not likely 
    that he will change”, this is what you think, but how many wrongdoers and evildoers, and even kaafirs, have been guided and set straight by 
    Allaah, for men's hearts are between two of the fingers of the Most Merciful and He turns them however He wills.

It is known that women are the twin halves of 
    men in society, and that they have a great role to play in raising the next generation and in reviving the ummah. A woman may work outside her 
    house in an appropriate job, without exposing herself to anything that goes against sharee’ah. 
With regard to treating male patients, and 
    all that it involves of mixing with them and being alone with them, this is not permissible according to sharee’ah, rather it is a fitnah (source 
    of temptation) that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has warned us against. It was reported that he  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No man should alone with a (non-mahram) woman unless her mahram is present.” Narrated by 
    Muslim, 3259. And he said: “I am not leaving behind me any temptation more harmful to men than women.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4808; Muslim, 
    6881. 
It is not permissible for a woman to treat a 
    man except in cases of necessity, such as if there is no male doctor available to treat him, or if the matter cannot be delayed as in the case of 
    accidents etc. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on

“Female doctors must treat only women and 
    male doctors must treat only men, except in cases of extreme necessity, if men are suffering a disease for which there is no male doctor

Aspects of the mercy of Allah towards His slaves","Praise be to Allah.Mercy of Allah
Allah is the Most Merciful , Most Compassionate, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy. His Mercy encompasses all things. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“… and My Mercy embraces all things.” [Al-A`araf 7:156] 
In Sahih Muslim, Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has one hundred parts of mercy, of which He sent down one between the jinn, mankind, the animals and the insects, by means of which they are compassionate and merciful to one another, and by means of which wild animals are kind to their offspring. And Allah has kept back ninety-nine parts of mercy with which to be merciful to His slaves of the Day of Resurrection.” (Muslim, al-Tawbah, 6908) 
‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Some prisoners were brought to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and there was a woman among the prisoners who was searching (for her child). When she found her child she embraced him and put him to her breast. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to us, ‘Do you think that this woman would throw her child in the fire?’ We said, ‘No, by Allah, not if she is able not to.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘Allah is more merciful to His slaves than this woman is to her child.’”  (Agreed upon)
Aspects of the mercy of Allah towards His slaves
One aspect of the Mercy of Allah to His slaves is that He sent the messengers and revealed the Books and laws to organize their lives according to the ways of wisdom, far removed from hardship and difficulty. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We have sent you (O Muhammad) not but as a mercy for the ‘alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists).” [Al-Anbiya 21:107] 
The Mercy of Allah is what will admit His believing slaves to Paradise on the Day of Resurrection. No one will ever enter Paradise because of his deeds alone, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one’s deeds will ever admit him to Paradise.” They said, “Not even you, O Messenger of Allah?” He said, “No, not even me, unless Allah showers me with His Mercy. So try to be near to perfection. And no one should wish for death; he is either doing good so he will do more of that, or he is doing wrong so he may repent.” [Al-Bukhari, Muslim] 
So the believer must remain in a state between hoping for the Mercy of Allah and fearing His punishment, for Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Declare (O Muhammad) unto My slaves, that truly, I am the Oft-Forgiving, the Most-Merciful. And that My Torment is indeed the most painful torment.” [Al-Hijr 15:49-50]

20472,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20472,When a person dies and the funeral prayer is not offered for him,The father of my husband died 20 years ago. Nobody was prayed and offered the Janaasah prayer. Can we do something about it?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.If this Muslim man died and the funeral 
    prayer was not offered for him, then it must be offered for him now, either by going to his grave, which is just for men, so one or more men may 
    go to his grave and offer the funeral prayer there; or by offering the funeral prayer in absentia for him (salaat al-ghaa’ib), in which both men 
    and women may take part. This prayer may be done anywhere; they may offer the prayer in the mosque or in a house, and they should form rows as if 
    the bier is in front of them. 
That is because offering the funeral prayer 
    for the deceased is obligatory. The evidence for that includes the hadeeth narrated in Saheeh al-Bukhaari (2176) and Saheeh Muslim 
    (1619) from Abu Hurayrah, which says that when a dead man who had a debt was brought to him, the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) would ask, “Did he leave behind anything with which to pay off his debt?” If he had left something behind, then he would offer 
    the funeral prayer for him, otherwise he would say, “Offer the funeral prayer for your companion.” When Allaah enabled him to conquer other lands, 
    he said, “I am closer to the believers than their own selves (cf. al-Ahzaab 33:6). Whoever dies in debt, I will repay it and whoever leaves behind 
    wealth, it is for his heirs.” 
But the funeral prayer is a communal 
    obligation (fard kifaayah); if enough people undertake this duty, then the rest of the Muslims are absolved of blame. 
It was narrated by al-Bukhaari (1337) and 
    Muslim (956) from Abu Hurayrah that a black person – a man or a woman – who used to clean the mosque died, and the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not know of the death. He mentioned him (or her) one day and he asked, “What happened to that person?” They 
    said “He (or she) died, O Messenger of Allaah.” He said, “Why did you not tell me?” They said ... (as if they thought the matter was not important 
    enough to tell the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about). He said, “Show me where his (or her) grave is,” and he went to 
    the grave and offered the funeral prayer. 
This indicates that it is permissible to 
    offer the funeral prayer for the deceased after the burial. 
It was narrated by al-Bukhaari (1333) and 
    Muslim (951) from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) announced the death of the Negus the 
    day he died, and he took the people out to the musalla (prayer place), lined them up in rows and pronounced four Takbeers (i.e., the funeral 
    prayer). 
This hadeeth indicates that it is permissible 
    to offer the funeral prayer in absentia. Some scholars restricted this to one for whom the funeral prayer has not been offered, and others 
    restricted it to scholars and virtuous people.  
From the texts quoted above we learn what we 
    stated at the beginning of this answer. The scholars have stated that if the deceased has been buried and the prayer has not been offered for him, 
    it should be offered after the burial. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: If the funeral prayer has not been offered for him, we should offer it even if 
    that is several years later.

The Standing Committee was asked the

A child of mine died 
    at the age of six months, and he was taken to the graveyard and buried without me offering the funeral prayer for him because I forgot. I do not 
    know where the grave is in which the child was buried. Is there any act of charity that will make up for the prayer, or any other act that will 
    make up for the prayer? 
The Committee answered: 
There is no other act that will make up for 
    the funeral prayer for the deceased, whether he was a child or an adult, whether an act of charity or any other righteous deed. You have to go to 
    the graveyard where he is buried, and stand with the graveyard between you and the qiblah, then offer the funeral prayer for this child, in a 
    state of purity (i.e., with wudoo’) and fulfilling all the conditions of prayer. That will be sufficient, since you do not know exactly where the 
    child’s grave is. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allaah burdens not a person beyond his 
    scope”
[al-Baqarah 2:286] 
“So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him 
    as much as you can”

This indicates that he is not to be trusted to take care of his children’s interests. The mother has the right to ask him in court for maintenance of his children.","Who has more right to custody in Islam?


Is maintenance of children obligatory upon the father?


If the father doesn't spend on his children, is he entitled to custody in Islam?","Praise be to Allah.Who has more right to custody in Islam?
One of the matters on which there is scholarly consensus is that the woman is more entitled to custody of the child so long as he has not reached the age of discernment, as the child at that stage needs the kind of compassion and care that only women can give. But this right is forfeited if the woman remarries , because she will be distracted by her new husband from taking care of her child, and because there is a conflict of interest between the child and the new husband. 
Ibn Al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated that there was scholarly consensus that the mother’s right to custody is forfeited if she remarries . (See: Al-Kafi by Ibn ‘Abd Al-Barr, 1/296; Al-Mughni, 8/194) 
This is indicated by the Hadith of `Abdullah ibn `Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) according to whom a woman said: O Messenger of Allah, my womb was a vessel for this son of mine, and my breasts gave him to drink, and my lap was a refuge for him, but his father has divorced me and he wants to take him away from me. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to her: “You have more right to him so long as you do not remarry.” (Narrated by Ahmad (6707) and Abu Dawud (2276); classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, and classed as sound by Ibn Katheer in Irshad Al-Faqih (2/250))
Is maintenance of children obligatory upon the father?
Maintenance of children is obligatory upon the father according to scholarly consensus, whether he keeps his wife or divorces her, and whether the wife is poor or rich. So she is not obliged to spend on the children if the father is around. 
If the children are in the custody of a divorced woman , then their father must support them, and the mother who has custody of a child who is still breastfeeding has the right to ask for payment for nursing the child. 
Maintenance of children includes accommodation, food, drink, clothing and education, and everything that the child needs, and is to be based on what is reasonable, paying attention to the husband’s situation, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Let the rich man spend according to his means; and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allah has given him. Allah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him. Allah will grant after hardship, ease.” [Al-Talaq 65:7]
This varies from one country to another and from one person to another. 
If the husband is rich then he must spend according to his wealth, and if he is poor or of moderate means, then he must also spend according to his means. If the parents agree upon a specific amount of money, whether it is large or small, then that is up to them. But in the case of a dispute, the one who decides about that is the judge. 
It is permissible for a divorced woman to ask her ex-husband for payment for breastfeeding the child , according to scholarly consensus. 
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni: 
“(The expenses for) breastfeeding the child are to be borne by the father only, and he has no right to force the mother to breastfeed the child if she is divorced, and we know of no difference of opinion concerning that."" (Al-Mughni  11/430).
He also said: “If the mother asks for payment at the usual rate for breastfeeding, she is more entitled to that, whether the father finds someone else to breastfeed him for free or not. "" (Al-Mughni  11/431) 
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“With regard to payment for breastfeeding, she is entitled to that according to scholarly consensus, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if they breastfeed for you (nurse your child), then give them their payment.” [Al-Talaq 65:6]."" (Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra  3/347) 
If the father doesn't spend on his children, is he entitled to custody in Islam?
With regard to custody – as defined by a number of scholars – it means taking care of the one who has not reached the age of discernment and cannot live independently, raising him in accordance with his best interests, and protecting him from anything that may harm him. (Rawdat Al-Talibin, 9/98) 
This means, taking care of the small child and looking after him. So the main issue of custody is taking care of the interests of the child. Hence if the father refuses to undertake this duty towards the child, which includes maintenance, then he is sinning, and forfeits his right to custody .
It says in Ar-Rawd Al-Murbi`: “The child should not stay with one who does not protect him and take care of him, because that is contrary to the purpose of custody."" (Al-Rawd Al-Murbi’  3/251)
Ibn Qudamah Al-Maqdisi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Custody is aimed at looking after the child, so it should not be given in a way that will be detrimental to his welfare and his religious commitment."" (Al-Mughni  8/190)  
Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“If we give precedence to one of the parents, we must pay attention to how he looks after the child. Hence Malik and Al-Layth said: If the mother is not in a safe place or she is not of good character, then the father has the right to take the child from her. Similarly, in the well known report from him, Imam Ahmad said that it depends on his ability to take care of the child. If he is careless or unable to do that, or is not of good character, or he is immoral and the mother is different from him, then she undoubtedly has more right to take the daughter. Our Shaykh said: If one of the parents fails to educate the boy and raise him in accordance with Islamic teachings, then he is sinning and has no guardianship over him. Anyone who does not do his duties as a guardian has no guardianship. He should either be dismissed as the guardian and replaced by someone who will do what is required, or someone else should be appointed with him who will do what is required along with him, because the aim is to obey Allah and His Messenger according to one’s ability … If the father marries a woman who does not take care of his daughter, and her mother is better able to take care of her than this co-wife, then custody should definitely be given to the mother ."" (Zad Al-Ma`ad  5/424) 
Shaykh `Abd Ar-Rahman As-Sa`di said: 
“If one of them neglects their duties with regard to custody and care of the child, then he forfeits his guardianship and the other should be appointed instead."" (Al-Fatawa As-Sa`diyyah  p. 535)
Based on this, if the father refuses to spend on his children’s maintenance, he forfeits the right to custody, even if his refusal is aimed at hurting the mother. This indicates that he is not to be trusted to take care of his children’s interests. The mother has the right to ask him in court for maintenance of his children.

20474,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20474,How can one who has a continual discharge do Tawaaf?,"Can you please advise me of the Islamic opinion of a man who is intending to go Hajj soon and has constant white discharge that is very runny (NOT mani or madhi).  
I have to make wudoo for every salat, and want to know what I would do during Tawaf of the Ka'ba. Would I need to make woudoo when I feel the discarge being released during Tawaf, or would it be sufficient to make wudoo before beginning Tawaf, and complete the Tawafs regardless of the discharge.  
Please respond to me as soon as possible as I will be travelling to Hajj soon.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The discharge that comes out of a man can only be one of three types: 
1 – It may be maniy which comes out with feelings of physical pleasure, whether in a wet dream, when having intercourse or in some other way. This is taahir (pure) and is not naajis (impure). What a person must do in the case is ghusl, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“If you are in a state of Janaaba (i.e. after a sexual discharge), purify yourselves (bathe your whole body)”
[al-Maa'idah 5:6]
2 – It may be madhiy which is a thin white viscid fluid that comes out when desire is provoked. This is naajis (impure) but its impurity is light and it is sufficient to wash the private parts, and to sprinkle with water whatever gets onto the clothes or body. This breaks one's wudoo’, so one has to do wudoo’ again. 
See al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 5/381 
3 – It may be neither of the above, in which case the ruling is the same as the ruling on urine: it is essential to wash off any of it that gets onto one's clothes, and it breaks one wudoo’ so wudoo’ must be repeated. 
See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 1/280. 
With regard to a person who has the discharge continually, the ruling is the same as the ruling on one who is affected by urinary incontinence, i.e., he must clean himself, and use some kind of protection so that it will not get onto his clothes or contaminate the places where he goes, such as mosques and the like. He should do wudoo’ at the time of each prayer, then do all the acts of worship for which tahaarah (purity) is required all together at that time, until the time ends. So you have to do wudoo’ before doing Tawaaf, then it does not matter what comes out after that. 
The Standing Committee was asked about a man who suffered from urinary incontinence – how should he purify himself for prayer and tawaaf? 
They replied: 
If the situation is as you described, there is nothing wrong with your praying and doing tawaaf even if some urine comes out of you, so long as it is coming out continuously, because you come under the same ruling as those who suffer from incontinence. So you have to wash yourself with water when the time for prayer begins, then do wudoo’ for prayer, after which it will not matter what comes out of you until the time for the next prayer comes. 
Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 5/408 
And they were asked about a man who passes urine continually and the flow never stops – how should he pray? 
They replied: He should pray according to his situation; he should wash himself with water and do wudoo’ for every prayer when the time for prayer comes, and he has to do what we have mentioned [i.e., using a pad of cotton etc] to prevent the urine getting onto his body or clothes, or soiling the mosque.

Signs of puberty for males and females in Islam


Sign of puberty for females in Islam


Importance of training children on doing obligatory duties","Praise be to Allah.The age of accountability in Islam
A person is not considered to be accountable until after reaching puberty. Before puberty he or she is not accountable. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Pen has been lifted from three: from the child until he reaches puberty, from the sleeper until he wakes up, and from the one who has lost his mind until he recovers.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4402)
 Based on this, then a girl has to put on complete hijab when she reaches puberty.  
Signs of puberty for males and females in Islam
There are three signs of puberty that males and females have in common: 

Nocturnal emissions (wet dreams)
Growth of coarse hair around the private parts
Reaching the age of fifteen 

Sign of puberty for females in Islam
In the case of females, there is a fourth sign which is: 

Menstruation 

Importance of training children on doing obligatory duties 
If one of these signs of puberty appears in a girl, then she is obliged to do all the obligatory duties and to avoid all haram things. One of the obligatory duties is wearing hijab . 
But the parent or guardian of a girl has to make her get used to doing the obligatory duties and avoiding haram things before puberty, so that she will grow up with that and it will not be too hard for her to adhere to that after she reaches puberty. This is one of the basic principles of child rearing that are established in the Shari`ah. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Train your children to pray when they are seven years old, and smack them (lightly, that is, discipline them) if they do not do so when they are ten, and separate them in their beds.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 495; Ahmad, 2/187, from the hadith of ‘Amr ibn Shu’ayb, narrated from his father from his grandfather.) 
Something similar was mentioned in the hadith of Saburah ibn Ma’bad which was narrated by Abu Dawud (494) and al-Tirmidhi (407). He said, it is hasan sahih. The hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Irwa, 247. 
Al-Bukhari (1960) and Muslim (91136) narrated in their sahihs from al-Rubayyi’ bint Mu’awwidh the hadith concerning the fast of ‘Ashura and when it was enjoined on the Muslims. 
In this hadith, it says: “And after that we used to fast it – meaning ‘Ashura – and make our small children fast, and we would go to the mosque and make them toys out of wool, and if one of them cried for food we would give them that toy (to play with) until iftar.” 
According to a report narrated by Muslim: If they asked us for food, we would give them the toy to distract them until they completed their fast. 
Al-Nawawi said in Sharh Sahih Muslim (8/14): 
“This hadith describes training children to do acts of obedience and making them get used to doing acts of worship, but they were not accountable.” 
Ibn al-Qayyim said in Tuhfat al-Mawdud bi Ahkam al-Mawlud (p. 162): 
“Even though the child is not accountable, his guardian is accountable and it is not permissible for him to enable him to do haram things, so that he becomes used to them and it is difficult to wean him away from them afterwards.” 
And Allah knows best and is most wise. 
So if a girl is approaching puberty, there is the fear that her not wearing hijab may cause young men to be tempted by her or her by them. Hence in this situation, her parent or guardian has to make her wear hijab so as to prevent means that may lead to evil or immorality.
And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
20476,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20476,Al-Khaafid,Can you give me an explanation of the beautiful name of Allah Al Khafid ?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Before discussing the meaning of this name, 
    we should understand some important issues that have to do with the names of Allaah. 
Firstly: The names and attributes of Allaah 
    should be based on evidence from the Book of Allaah (the Qur’aan) and the Sunnah of His Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him); there is no other source for knowing the names and attributes of Allaah apart from these two sources. 
Based on this, whatever names of Allaah are 
    affirmed in the Qur’aan and Sunnah are what we must accept and affirm. 
Whatever is denied in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, 
    we must also deny, whilst affirming its opposite. 
What is neither affirmed nor denied in the 
    Qur’aan and Sunnah, we must refrain from uttering it and neither affirm it nor deny it, because it has not been narrated in the sense of either 
    affirming or denying.  
With regard to the meaning of the name 
    al-Khaafid, it should be noted that if what is meant by it is something that is befitting to Allaah, then it is acceptable, and if what is meant 
    is something that is not befitting to Allaah, then we must reject it. 
From al-Qawaa’id al-Mathla fi Sifaat 
    Allaah wa Asmaa’ihi il-Husna by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen. 
Secondly: An action is broader in meaning 
    than a name. Hence Allaah has attributed to Himself actions for which He is not called by the active participle of the verb in question, such as 
    wanting (araada), willing (shaa’a) and causing to happen (ahdatha); He is not called al-mureed (the wanter or seeker) 
    or al-shaa’i (the willer) or al-muhdith (the causer). Similarly He did not call Himself al-saani’ (the maker), al-faa’il 
    (the doer), or al-mutqin (the one who does things perfectly), or other names derived from actions that He attributes to Himself. The scope 
    of actions is broader than the scope of words. 
Those who derive a name for Allaah from every 
    action made a serious mistake and made the number of His names reach more than one thousand. They called Him al-maakir (the plotter), 
    al-mukhaadi’ (the deceiver), al-faatin (the causer of tribulation), al-kaa’id (the schemer), etc. 
Similarly He has told us about Himself in 
    words that are broader in scope and are not names by which He has called Himself. We may refer to Him as shay’ (a thing), mawjood 
    (one who exists), madhkoor (one who is mentioned or remembered), ma’loom (one who is known), muraad (one who is sought), and 
    so on, but He is not to be named in these terms. 
The word al-Waajid (the one who is 
    independent of means) is not mentioned as a name of Allaah except in the hadeeth which lists the beautiful names (of Allaah). But the correct view 
    is that this is not the Prophet’s words, although the meaning is sound. For Allaah is indeed the One Who has the means (dhu’l-wajd) and is 
    independent of all others, so it would be more apt to call Him al-Waajid than al-Mawjood (the one who exists) or al-Moojid 
    (the initiator). The word al-mawjood (one who exists) may refer to something that is perfect or imperfect, good or evil (so the thing 
    referred to by this name may be perfect or imperfect). If a name may refer to either of these, then it cannot be a name of Allaah, so we cannot 
    call Him al-Shay’ (the thing) or al-Ma’loom (the one who is known). Hence Allaah is not called al-Mureed (the seeker) or 
    al-Mutakallim (the speaker) or al-Moojid (the initiator). He has called Himself by names that carry the most perfect meanings in that 
    regard viz. al-Khaaliq (the Creator), al-Baari’ (the Creator), and al-Musawwir (the Shaper). Al-Moojid (the initiator) 
    is like al-Muhdith (the one who causes things to happen), al-Faa’il (the doer) and al-Saani’ (the maker). This is a very 
    subtle and deep understanding of the beautiful names of Allaah, so give some thought to it. And Allaah is the Source of strength, 
From Madaarij al-Saalikeen by Ibn 
    al-Qayyim, 3/383-385 
Thirdly:  The names that are given to Allaah 
    must be taken from the sound texts; this is not a matter that is subject to ijtihaad or individual reasoning. But what is said in the context of 
    speaking about Him is not subject to the same restrictions, so for example it may be said that He is al-qadeem (the Ancient), al-shay’ 
    (the thing [i.e., as opposed to nothing]), al-mawjood (the one who exists), al-qaa’im bi nafsihi (the self sufficient). This is the 
    bottom line with regard to the issue of whether His names are tawqeefi (i.e., not subject to ijtihaad) or it is permissible to call Him by some 
    names that are not reported in the texts. 
From Badaa’i’ al-Fawaa’id by Ibn 
    al-Qayyim, 1/162 
Fourthly: Among the names of Allaah there are 
    some which cannot be used in isolation unless their opposite is also mentioned; if such a name is used on its own, it may give an impression of 
    imperfection – exalted be Allaah far above that. These names include al-Mu’ti, al-Maani’ (the Giver, the Withholder); al-Daarr, 
    al-Naafi’ (the One who harms, the One Who benefits); al-Qaabid, al-Baasit  (the Constrictor, the Expander); al-Mu’izz, al-Mudhill 
    (the Honourer, the Humiliator); al-Khaafid al-Raafi’ (the Abaser, the Exalter). Allaah cannot be called al-Maani’ (the Withholder),
    al-Daarr (the One who harms), al-Qaabid (the Constrictor), al-Mudhill (the Humiliator) and al-Khaafid (the Abaser) 
    using these names on their own; rather they must be accompanied by their opposites, because they only appear as such (in pairs) in the 
    Revelation. 
From Ma’aarij al-Qubool by al-Hakami, 
    1/64. 
Once the following is understood, the name 
    al-Khaafid is only narrated in the hadeeth which lists the beautiful names of Allaah. The correct view is that this is not the words of the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as stated above in the words of Ibn al-Qayyim. This is what has been confirmed by more 
    than one scholar such as Imam Ibn Taymiyah (as stated in al-Fataawa, 6/379-380, 8/96, 22/482); al-Haafiz ibn Katheer in his Tafseer 
    (3/515); al-Haafiz ibn Hajar in al-Fath (11/221) and al-Buloogh (1395), and others. 
But the meaning of this name is correct, so 
    long as it is accompanied by the name al-Raafi’ (the Exalter). It was proven in Saheeh Muslim (179) from the hadeeth of Abu Moosa 
    al-Ash’ari that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah does not sleep and it is not befitting that He should 
    sleep. He lowers justice and raises it. The deeds of the night are taken up to Him before the deeds of the day, and the deeds of the day before 
    the night…”  There are also some reports from the salaf concerning that, and the mu’allaq report which al-Bukhaari narrated in his 
    Saheeh (al-Fath, 8/487) from Abu’l-Darda’, which says that he said concerning the verse “Every day He is 
    (engaged) in some affair (such as giving honour or disgrace to some, life or death to some)” [al-Rahmaan 55:29 – interpretation of the meaning]: 
    “He forgives sins, relieves distress, raises some people in status and humiliates others.” This was also narrated in a marfoo’ report (i.e., 
    attributed to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)). 
Once this is 
    understood, the scholars have also discussed the meaning of the name al-Khaafid, such as the following: 
1 – al-Khattaabi said in Sha’n al-Du’a’(58): 
     
Al-Khaafid, al-Raafi’ 
    (the Abaser, the Exalter): similarly when it comes to these two names, it is better to mention them together. Al-Khaafid is the one who brings 
    down tyrants and humiliates the arrogant Pharaohs, and al-Raafi’ is the one who raises His close friends (awliya’) in status through their acts of 
    obedience; He raises them in status, supports them against their enemies and grants them the ultimate victory. No one can prevail except the one 
    whom Allaah raises and no one can be lowered except the one whom He humiliates. 
2 – al-Haleemi said, according to al-Asma’ 
    wa’l-Sifaat by al-Bayhaqi (1/193): 
The name al-Khaafid 
    should not be used on its own in du’aa’ without the name al-Raafi’. Al-Khaafid is the one who puts people in a lower position, and al-Raafi’ is 
    the one who puts them in a higher position. 
3 – Qiwaam al-Sunnah al-Asbahaani said in 
    al-Hujjah fi Bayaan al-Mahajjah (1/140): 
Among His names are al-Khaafid, al-Raafi’ 
    (the Abaser, the Exalter). It was said that al-Khaafid is the one who brings down tyrants and humiliates the arrogant Pharaohs, and al-Raafi’ is 
    the one who raises His close friends (awliya’) in status and supports them against their enemies. He humiliates whomsoever He will among His 
    slaves, lowering him in status and making him unknown and insignificant. And He elevates whomsoever He will among His slaves, raising him in 
    status and position. No one can rise except those whom He raises in status and no one can be humiliated except those whom He lowers in status. And 
    it was said that He raises justice and lowers it. 
Then he narrated the hadeeth of Abu Moosa 
    that was narrated by Muslim (293): “Allaah does not sleep and it is not befitting that He should sleep. He lowers justice and raises it. The deeds 
    of the night are taken up to Him before the deeds of the day, and the deeds of the day before the night…” 
Then he said: The 
    scholars said: what is meant by “He lowers justice and raises it” is: He lowers justice by causing oppressors to prevail, and He raises justice by 
    causing justice to prevail. He lowers justice by means of the unjust and he raises justice by means of just leaders. By alternately lowering and 
    raising the level of justice He tests His slaves to see how they will be patient in the face of adversity and thankful for times of ease. 
4 – Shaykh Ibn Sa’di said in al-Haqq 
    al-Waadih al-Mubeen (258):  
He is al-Raafi’ for people who are righteous 
    and knowledgeable and have faith, and He is al-Khaafid for His enemies. 
It says in Tawdeeh al-Kaafiyah al-Shaafiyah 
    (390): Know that the divine attributes that have to do with deeds are all connected to or based on these three attributes: absolute power, 
    ever-executed will and perfect wisdom. All of these are attributes of Allaah. The effects of these attributes prevail everywhere in the universe, 
    giving precedence to some and putting others behind, benefiting some and harming others, giving to some and withholding from others, abasing some 
    and exalting others. There is no difference in this between physical and moral, religious or worldly.  
Shaykh Muhammad Khaleel Harraas said in 
    Sharh al-Qaseedah al-Nooniyyah, 2/114: 
Allaah is al-Khaafid, 
    al-Raafi’ (the Abaser the Exalter). He abases the kuffaar by making their lives miserable and keeping them away from Him, and He raises His close 
    friends by drawing them close to Him and making them happy. He alternates things amongst His slaves, so He humiliates some people and makes them 
    insignificant and takes away their pride, and He raises others by causing them to inherit the authority and land of the former. 
All of these words are true, and they are 
    included in the meaning of al-Khaafid, al-Raafi’ (the Abaser, the Exalter).

    has told us that He will not forgive the one who does not repent to Him from it, but in the case of lesser sins the matter is subject to His will: 
    if He wills, He will forgive the one who meets Him with that sin unrepented for, and if He wills, He will punish him. This means that we should 
    fear shirk greatly, as it is so serious before Allaah. 
Fath al-Majeed, 
    p. 58. 
Hence we must repent from all kinds of shirk, 
    whether it is major shirk or minor shirk. If a person repents sincerely then Allaah will accept his repentance and forgive him his sins. 
After mentioning shirk in the verse in which 
    He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who invoke not any other ilaah (god) along with 
    Allaah”
[al-Furqaan 25:68]
and stating that its people will abide 
    forever in Hell, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Except those who repent and believe (in 
    Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allaah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Furqaan 25:68-70]
Repentance from shirk means giving it up and 
    submitting to Allaah alone, regretting one's neglect of Allaah’s rights and resolving never to go back to it. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“Say to those who have disbelieved, if 
    they cease (from disbelief), their past will be forgiven”
[al-Anfaal 8:38]
“If they cease” means, give up their kufr, by 
    submitting to Allaah alone with no partner or associate. Tafseer al-Sa’di. 
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Islam destroys that which came before it” – i.e., of sins. Narrated by Muslim 121. 
The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that the gate of repentance remains open so long at the death rattle has not reached a person’s throat. He

    his throat.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3537; see also Saheeh al-Jaami’, 1425. 
Whoever commits major shirk that puts a 
    person beyond the pale of Islam must repent sincerely from that, put his actions straight and correct his intention. It is also prescribed for him 
    to do ghusl after repenting, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded Qays ibn ‘Aasim to do that when he 
    became Muslim. (Narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi and al-Nasaa’i; classed as saheeh by Ibn al-Sakan.

With regard to minor shirk, the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned us against it, fearing that his ummah might fall into it. He  (peace and

    al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (951): its isnaad is jayyid). And he said: “Shirk among you is more subtle than the sound of the footsteps of an ant 
    on a rock. Shall I not tell you of something which, if you do it, it will take that away from you, both minor and major forms of it.
