1504,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1504,"If it is not known whether a
    person is a Muslim or a kaafir, can we say salaam to him?","If I meet a person and I do not know
      whether he is a kaafir or a Muslim, should I say salaam to him or return his greeting or
      not?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It was reported in the hadeeth that you should say
    salaam to those you know and those you do not (narrated by al-Bukhaari, 12; al-Fath
    1/55) but this applies only to Muslims, or those who appear to be Muslim.
    It was also reported that it is forbidden to say salaam to Jews and Christians, because
    the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do not initiate the
    greeting of salaam to a Jew or Christian, and if you meet them in the street, push them to
    the narrowest part of the road.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2167). He
    also said: “If the People of the Book greet you with salaam, say ‘wa
    ‘alaykum’ (and also upon you).” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6258).
    But at that time the People of the Book were distinct
    from the Muslims in their dress and appearance, and they were not allowed to resemble
    Muslims. But in these times, unfortunately, many Muslims look like them, and we can no
    longer tell the difference between a Muslim and a Christian. Everyone - except for those
    whom Allaah wills – looks the same in dress, in being clean-shaven, in wearing
    nothing on their heads, or wearing western-style caps, so the matter is more confusing. If
    someone who looks like the mushrikeen says salaam to you, say “Wa
    ‘alaykum,” and do not initiate the greeting, because of the uncertainty about
    him. If he objects and tells you off, then apologize to him. You had reason to act as you
    did, because you did know whether he was a Muslim or a Christian, because he is not
    dressing as a Muslim and prefers the dress of the Christians and others. Tell him that
    “whoever imitates a people is one of them” (Saheeh, narrated by Imaam
    Ahmad, 2/50-92), and advise him to distinguish himself from the kuffaar and
    to dress as the Muslims dress, like his father, grandfathers and the scholars of the
    Muslims. If he persists in what he is doing, this means that he likes the characteristics
    of the Christians and is imitating them, and that he despises the Muslims and is going
    against them, even though he does not gain anything from that besides blind imitation.
    This indicates that he admires those kuffaar and thinks that their worldly achievements
    and inventions, etc., stem from their false religion. This is going too far, for the
    Muslims are wiser and more able to invent and produce, so he should not be deceived by the
    Mushrikeen.","Al-Lu’lu’ al-Makeen fi Fataawaa al-Shaykh ibn Jibreen, p. 49"

Each individual reads one juz’ (part) of the Quran, claiming that the entire Quran will have been read in this gathering. Is this permissible or is it counted as being bid’ah (innovation)?",,,"Praise be to Allah.In my opinion the action mentioned is not permissible, and I do not recall anything of this kind being reported from the Salaf. A person will only be rewarded for what he himself reads or listens to in order to benefit from it. But if another person reads and he does not listen, the reward for that will go to the person who read it. These people are not considered to have completed the whole Quran; but if each person has read a juz’ he will be rewarded for that. But they should not do this; either one person should read and the others listen, or each person should read by himself without making a connection between his reading and that of the others.","Al-Lu’lu’ al-Makeen min Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Jibreen, p. 50"

          as his religion. The belief that all religions on earth are correct 
          and that their followers are all following the truth is one of the gravest 
          falsehoods and one of the greatest examples of kufr. Allaah says (interpretation

“…Say: 
          ‘Are those who know equal to those who know not?’…” 
[al-Zumar 39:9]

          to themselves?’ Say: ‘Is the blind equal to the one who sees? Or darkness 
          equal to light?’” 
[al-Ra’d 13:16] 
“Say 
          (O Muhammad): ‘Not equal are Al-Khabeeth (all that is evil and 
          bad as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods) and At-Tayyib 
          (all that is good as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods)…’” 
          
[al-Maa’idah 5:100] 
          
“Not 
          alike are the blind (disbelievers in Islamic Monotheism) and the seeing 
          (believers in Islamic Monotheism).

1507,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1507,Why Is Interest Haram?,"As we know interest is haram in Islam but can you please tell me why it is haram? I have some money but I don't know how to invest the money. There is someone who knows how to manage this money if I gave him my money and fix some amount for him as interest. We both agree on this and we are both pleased with this decision. Is it still haram? If yes, then can you please explain it for me?",Riba (interest) is haram because Allah has forbidden it. Mutual consent to commit a haram deed does not make it halal. So accepting interest does not make it permissible.,"Why is interest haram?


Does accepting riba make is halal?","Praise be to Allah.Why is interest haram?
Riba (which means adding something extra to certain products, like selling gold for gold, or by not receiving something when a contract is signed, or paying extra in return for extension of a loan) is haram because Allah - Who rules as He wills - has forbidden it. No one can ask Him about what He does; He is the One Who will ask people about what they did, on the Day of Resurrection. Allah has explained that riba is haram, and warned those who do not give it up, in the verses (interpretation of the meaning):

""O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah and give up what remains (due to you) from riba (usury) (from now onward), if you are (really) believers. And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger . . ."" [al-Baqarah 2:278-279]
Does accepting riba make is halal?
One of the most important points to remember about Islamic Shari`ah - and this is one of the major differences between Shari`ah and earthly jahili laws - is that mutual consent to commit a haram deed does not make it halal.
If a man and a woman agree to commit zina (fornication or adultery), it does not become halal.
If a businessman agrees with the bank to deposit a sum of money in the bank and take interest on it, or to take out a loan and pay interest on it, that does not make such transactions halal. Things that are haram will remain so until the Day of Judgement.

Man is ignorant and inclined to do wrong. He may not even know what is in his own interests or in the interests of others, so he may do things that harm himself or others.

You state in your question that you want to give some money to a person to invest it, in return for something. There is nothing wrong with that if it is done in accordance with Shari`ah, which includes a contract of silent partnership - i.e., you give money to someone to do business on your behalf, in return for an agreed percentage of the profits.

According to Shari`ah, a contract of silent partnership includes the following:

The one who receives the money for investment is not permitted to guarantee the capital and is not expected to repay it except in cases of recklessness or negligence.
In the event of loss, the investor loses his capital and the one who took the money loses the time and effort invested.

May Allah help you and us to earn a halal income.

1511,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1511,Ruling on wills which deprive some of one's children of their inheritance,i would like to know can a person cut out any of his childern from the inheritences. because their was some problems between him and his son-in-law. or use it as an excuse to cut his daughters out of the inheritences. can a person that has 10 childern .give one of them more then the other. while he is still alive put in his name a house and land and say it is not haram because it is his money and nobody has anything to do with it.,,,"Praise be to Allah.This will is not permissible, because it goes 
          against the teachings of sharee’ah and is contrary to the justice and 
          fairness that Allaah has enjoined, especially among one's children. 
          Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“There 
          is a share for men and a share for women from what is left by parents 
          and those nearest related, whether, the property be small or large — 
          a legal share” 
[al-Nisaa’ 4:7]  
          
Then Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning); 
          
“Allaah 
          commands you as regards your children’s (inheritance): to the male, 
          a portion equal to that of two females; if (there are) only daughters, 
          two or more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, 
          her share is a half. For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each 
          if the deceased left children; if no children, and the parents are the 
          (only) heirs, the mother has a third; if the deceased left brothers 
          or (sisters), the mother has a sixth. (The distribution in all cases 
          is) after the payment of legacies he may have bequeathed or debts. You 
          know not which of them, whether your parents or your children, are nearest 
          to you in benefit; (these fixed shares) are ordained by Allaah. And 
          Allaah is Ever All‑Knower, All‑Wise” 
[al-Nisaa’ 4:11]  
          
Then Allaah warns those who go against this 
          division of legacies and play with it, by saying (interpretation of 
          the meaning); 
“And 
          whosoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger (Muhammad), and transgresses 
          His limits, He will cast him into the Fire, to abide therein; and he 
          shall have a disgraceful torment”[al-Nisaa’ 
          4:14]  
Whoever deprives some of his children of their 
          inheritance, or gives some of them less than is their shar’i due, or 
          gives some more than is their shar’i due, or includes someone who is 
          not an heir among those who are given his legacy, is a sinner who is 
          guilty of committing a major sin. Also, it is not permissible to make 
          a will concerning one’s heir, because he has a share which is defined 
          by sharee’ah. Ahmad, Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi (may Allaah have mercy 
          on them) narrated from Abu Umaamah (may Allaah be pleased with him) 
          that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah has given everyone 
          who is entitled his rights, so there is no will concerning the heir.” 
          (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 2046).  
          
If it is proven according to sharee’ah that 
          one of the children is a kaafir, e.g. by the fact that he does not pray, 
          at the time of the father’s death, then he is not an heir, even if instructions 
          to that effect are not mentioned in the will, because the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Muslim does not 
          inherit from the kaafir and the kaafir does not inherit from the Muslim.” 
          (Saheeh – agreed upon).  
With regard to giving a gift to one of one's 
          children and not to the others for no shar’i reason, this is haraam 
          and is unfair, as it creates hatred in the children’s hearts towards 
          one another. The evidence (daleel) that it is forbidden is the hadeeth 
          narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim (may Allaah have mercy on them) from 
          al-Nu’maan ibn Basheer (may Allaah be pleased with him), that his father 
          came to the Prophet  (peace and 
          blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: “I have given this son of 
          mine one of my slaves.” The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Have you given all 
          your children a similar gift?” He said, “No.” He said, “Then take it 
          back.” According to the version narrated by Muslim, he said: “Fear Allaah 
          and treat your children fairly.” So my father took back his gift.  
          
According to another version, he (may Allaah 
          be pleased with him) said: “My father took me to the Messenger of Allaah 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) and said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, bear witness that I have 
          given al-Nu’maan such-and-such of my wealth.’ He said, ‘Have you given 
          all your children something similar to what you have given to al-Nu’maan?’ 
          He said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Then let someone else bear witness.’ Then he 
          said, ‘Would you not like all your children to honour you equally?’ 
          He said, ‘Of course.’ He said, ‘Then you should not do that.’” (Muslim, 
          3059).  
But if the gift is being given to one of the children 
          for a shar’i reason, such as the child being poor, or in debt, or needing 
          medical treatment, then there is nothing wrong with that. And Allaah 
          knows best. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad, and grant him peace.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

I committed a sin in their house before, and before this dream, I was always worrying that they might find out through a dream. How do I know for sure if I saw the Prophet in this dream?
This is worrying me very much. Also, I just had a dream, where I thought it was the Prophet again, during his last recitation of the Quran to Jibreel (AS) during Ramadan. Zaid (RA) was there, too, but also Hamzah (RA) was there in my dream. I know that Hamzah (RA) wasn't really there, because he was martyred at Uhud. So was this the Prophet in this dream?

•	with a pinkish colour, 
•	not very white and not dark, 
•	and his hair was neither very curly nor very straight.",What did Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) look like?,"Praise be to Allah.What did Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) look like?
We will quote below a number of hadiths which describe Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). If what you saw in your dream is in accordance with this, then you did indeed see the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), because he said: ""Whoever sees me in a dream has really seen me, because Shaytan cannot appear in my image."" (Reported by al-Bukhari, 5729)

Rabi'ah ibn Abi 'Abd al-Rahman said: ""I heard Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) describing the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He said: 

'He was of average height, 
not too tall and not too short, 
with a pinkish colour, 
not very white and not dark, 
and his hair was neither very curly nor very straight. 

The Revelation came to him when he was forty years old, and he stayed in Makkah for ten years after the Revelation came, then in Madinah for ten years. When he died, there were no more than twenty white hairs on his head and in his beard."" (Al-Bukhari, 3283)
Al-Bara ibn 'Azib said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was broad shouldered and had thick hair coming down to his shoulders and earlobes. He was wearing red garments. I have never seen anything more beautiful than him."" (Reported by Muslim, Kitab al-Fadail, Bab Sifat Sha'r al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), no. 2338)

'Ali said: 

""He was neither tall nor short,
and had large hands and feet. 
He had a large head and was big-boned, 
and the thin line of hair (starting from his chest and extending to the navel) was long. 
When he walked, he would lean forward, as if he was walking downhill. 
I have never seen anyone like him, before or since."" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 3570, who said this is a sahih hasan hadith).
	 

Jabir ibn Samurah said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was dali' al-fam, ash-kal al-'ayn and manhus al-'aqib.""

He said, 'His heels were not fleshy.'"" (Sahih Muslim, Kitab al-Fadail, 2339)

1513,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1513,Doctor's Knowledge of the Fetus,Is the doctors knowledge of the fetus in the uterus complete?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
Imaam Abu Abdullaah Muhammad ibn Ismaaeel al-Bukhaari reported, in al-Jaami al-Saheeh, 
which is the soundest book after the Quraan:
""Ibraaheem ibn al-Mundhir told me that Man told us that Maalik told me, from Abdullaah ibn 
Deenaar from Ibn Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allaah 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: The keys of the Unknown are five, which no-one knows 
except Allaah: no-one knows what will happen tomorrow except Allaah; no-one knows what is 
in the wombs except Allaah; no-one knows when it will rain except Allaah; no-one knows in 
which land he will die; and no-one knows when the Hour will begin except Allaah."" (Saheeh 
al-Bukhaari, Kitaab Tafseer al-Quraan, hadeeth no. 4328).
He also reported it with the wording: ""The keys of the Unseen are five: Verily, Allah! With 
Him (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour, He send down the rain, and knows that which is 
in the wombs. No person knows what he will earn tomorrow, and no person knows in what 
land he will die. Verily Allaah is All-Knower, All-Aware (of things) [Luqmaan 31:34]."" 
(Saheeh al-Bukhaari, Kitaab Tafseer al-Quraan, Baab (wa indahu mafaatih al-ghaybi laa yalamu illaa huwa), 
hadeeth no. 4261).
Allaah is the only One Who has knowledge of the Unseen, as He says (Interpretation of the 
meaning) : 
""Say: None in the heavens and the earth knows the Unseen except Allaah . . ."" [al-Naml 
27:65] The Unseen referred to in this aayah is the same as that described in Soorat Luqmaan 
(see quote in preceding paragraph).
There is no doubt whatsoever that this hadeeth is saheeh. What has confused the questioner is 
the fact that doctors are able to know the gender of the foetus via x-rays and ultrasound scans, 
but we should note that this knowledge is vague and incomplete. They may make mistakes, as 
has happened on numerous occasions. Moreover, they can only perform these scans etc. after 
a certain number of weeks of pregnancy have passed, and not before. Even if they know 
whether the foetus is male or female, they do not know whether it will be miscarried or carried 
to term, whether it will be born alive or dead. They do not know the precise length of time that 
it will stay in its mothers womb. They have nothing but conjecture and uncertainties. They do 
not know how long this person will live, how he will behave or what his provision will be, or 
whether he will be of the people of Paradise or the people of Hell. Knowledge of what is in the 
wombs is not merely a matter of knowing whether the foetus is male or female; it is broader 
than that, and no-one can know it all except Allaah, as He says (Interpretation of the meaning):
""Allaah knows what every female bears, and by how much the wombs fall short or exceed. 
Everything with Him is in (due) proportion."" [al-Rad 13:8]
In his Tafseer of this aayah, Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: ""Allaah is telling 
us here of His complete knowledge: nothing is hidden from Him and He knows fully what the 
females of every species carry in their wombs. He says (Interpretation of the meaning): (He) 
knows that which is in the wombs, i.e., He knows whether it is male or female, good or bad, 
destined for Paradise or doomed to Hell, whether its life will be long or short. Similarly He says 
(Interpretation of the meaning): He knows you well when He created you from the earth, and 
when you were foetuses in your mothers wombs [al-Najm 53:32]
In the two Saheehs there is a report from Ibn Masood, who said: The Messenger of Allah 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: ""The way that each of you is created is that he is gathered in 
your mothers womb for forty days and then for a similar length of time as a blood-clot and 
then for a similar length of time as a lump of flesh. Then an angel is sent and he breathes the 
spirit into him and is charged with four commands: to write down his provision, his life-span, 
his actions, and whether he will be wretched or happy."" According to another hadeeth, the 
angel says: O Lord, male or female? Wretched or happy? How much provision? How long a 
life span? and he writes that.""
Al-Awfi said, from Ibn Abbaas: ""and by how much the wombs fall short"" refers to 
miscarriage, and or exceed means how how far beyond the normal time the pregnancy will 
last before a child is born, because some women carry a child for ten months and some for 
nine months; the length of pregnancy varies from woman to woman. This is what is referred to 
here. Al-Dahhaak said, from Ibn Abbaas, that this phrase referred to pregnancies longer or 
shorter than nine months.""
Every Muslim must believe in what the Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) has told us, and 
not doubt a single word of it, because what the Prophet says is wahy (revelation) revealed to 
him by Allaah:
""By the star when it goes down, your companion (i.e., Muhammad) has neither gone astray 
nor has erred. Nor does he speak of (his own) desire. It is only an Inspiration [wahy] that is 
inspired."" [al-Najm 53:1-4]
Whoever doubts what the Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said or doubts that it is wahy is 
a kaafir who has left Islam.
The Muslim must believe that what the Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said is absolutely 
true. This is shown in the hadeeth of Abdullaah ibn Amar, who said: ""I used to write down 
everything that I heard from the Messenger of Allaah 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him), because I 
wanted to memorize it. Quraysh told me not to do that and said: Are you writing everything 
down that you hear? The Messenger of Allaah is only a man who may speak when he is angry 
or happy. So I stopped writing things down, and I mentioned this to the Messenger of Allaah 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him). He pointed to his mouth and said: Write; by the One in Whose 
hand is my soul, nothing comes out of it (my mouth) but the truth."" (Reported by Abu Dawud, may 
Allaah have mercy on him, in al-Sunan, Kitaab al-Ilm, hadeeth no. 3161, see also Saheeh al-Jaami, no. 1196).

Based on this fact, these actions are bid‘ah (a reprehensible innovation) which is not permitted; we should avoid it and warn others not to do it. The Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) used to say in his khutbahs (sermons): ""The truest of speech is the Book of Allah, the best guidance is that of Muhammad and the worst of things are those which are newly invented. Every newly-invented thing is a bid‘ah, every bid‘ah is a going astray, and every going astray will end in the Fire of Hell."" (Reported by al-Nisaa’i, may Allah have mercy on him, in al-Sunan, Kitaab salaat al-‘eidayn, no. 1560).
 
It is permissible to pray for the deceased, without arranging a formal gathering, and without setting a specific date for doing so. We ask Allah to help us and you to do that which He loves and which will please Him.

1528,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1528,Taking the crescent as a symbol,"What is the symbolism behind the
      Muslim star and crescent? I did a keyword search of your site and searched my library's
      reference books and cannot find anything more than a reference to the flag of the Ottoman
      Empire. Thank you for your interest.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is no basis in shareeah for taking the crescent or star as
    a symbol of the Muslims. This was not known at the time of the Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), or at the time of the Khulafa al-Raashidoon (the
    first four leaders of Islam after the death of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah
    be upon him), or during the time of the Umawis (Umayyad dynasty). It emerged some time
    after that, and historians differ as to when this symbol was first adopted and who was the
    first to adopt it. Some say it was the Persians, others say it was the Greeks, and that
    this symbol was somehow passed to the Muslims. (See Al-Taraateeb al-Idaariyah
    by al-Kittaani, 1/320). It was said that the reason why the Muslims adopted
    the crescent was that when they conquered some western countries, the churches there had
    crosses on top of them, the Muslims replaced the crosses with these crescents, and the
    practice spread in this way. Whatever the case, symbols and banners must be in accordance
    with the teachings of Islam, and as there is no evidence that this symbol is prescribed by
    Islam, it is better not to use it. Neither the crescent nor the star are symbols of the
    Muslims, even though some Muslims may use them as symbols. 
    As regards what Muslims think about the moon and the stars, they
    believe that they are part of the creation of Allaah, and as such can neither benefit nor
    harm people, and they do not have any influence over events on earth. Allaah has created
    them for the benefit of mankind, an example of which is seen in the aayah or verse of the
    Quraan (interpretation of the meaning):
They ask you (O Muhammad) about the new moons. Say: These are
    signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage
    [al-Baqarah 2:189]
[The commentator] Ibn Katheer said, explaining the phrase Say: these
    are signs to mark fixed periods of time: From them (the new moons) they may know
    the times for repaying loans, the iddah (waiting period) of their women
    [after being divorced or widowed] and the timing of their Hajj (pilgrimage) Allaah
    has made them signs to mark the times when Muslims should start to fast and break their
    fast [the beginning and end of Ramadaan], to count the iddah of their women
    and to know the times for repaying loans. (Tafseer Ibn Katheer).
    [Another commentator] Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on
    him) said in his commentary on this aayah [verse]: This explains the wisdom behind
    the waxing and waning of the moon, which is to avoid any confusion in appointed dates,
    dealings, oaths, Hajj, iddah, fasting, breaking fasts, length of pregnancy,
    rentals and other matters that concern mankind. Similar to this aayah are others
    (interpretation of the meanings): 
And We have appointed the night and the day as two aayaat
    (signs). Then, We have made dark the sign of the night while We have made the sign of day
    illuminating, that you may seek bounty from your Lord, and that you may know the number of
    the years and the reckoning [al-Isra 17:12]
It is He Who made the sun a shining thing and the moon as a light
    and measured out its (their) stages, that you might know the number of years and the
    reckoning [Yoonus 10:5]
Counting the new moons is easier than counting days. (See Tafseer
    al-Qurtubi).
    With regard to the stars, the scholars of Islam say that
    Allaah created these stars for three reasons: to adorn the heavens, to drive away the
    devils (shayaateen) and as signs for navigation. (Saheeh al-Bukhaari,
    Kitaab Bad al-Khalq), as Allaah says (interpretation of the
    meaning): 
    It is He Who has set the stars for you, so that you may guide
    your course with their help through the darkness of the land and the sea
    [al-Anaam 6:97]
And indeed We have adorned the nearest heaven with lamps, and We
    have made such lamps (as) missiles to drive away the shayaateen (devils), and have
    prepared for them the torment of the blazing Fire. [al-Mulk 67:5]",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

    on a person insisting by an oath that his Lord should do something?","Is it permissible for any person
      nowadays to swear an oath insisting that Allaah should do something that he wants, or not?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to swear an oath saying I
    swear, O Lord, that You should send down rain, or defeat the Jews, or make So and so
    rich, or give him such and such, or do for me what I ask in this place, and so on. This
    implies that a person is obliging his Lord to do something, but it is Allaah Who controls
    the affairs of His slaves, and His slave has no right to make demands of his Lord or try
    to oblige Him to do anything. This goes against Tawheed, or it either compromises its
    integrity or uproots it altogether, depending on the persons intentions. The reports
    about some of the Salaf insisting by an oath that Allaah should do something probably
    refer to their duaas (supplications). The hadeeth of the Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him): There are among the slaves of Allaah those who, if
    they were to insist by an oath that Allaah should do something, He would fulfil it (narrated
    by al-Bukhaari, 2703) is hypothetical in nature, meaning that Allaah would
    respond to such a person's duaa although it is known that nobody would dare to

    the Hijri date is written first, followed by the equivalent Gregorian date. The Hijri date
    is based on the lunar months, which are clear and can be readily observed by anyone who
    has eyes to see, but the Gregorian months do not have any clearly visible signs and can
    only be known through calculations. Hence the Islamic sharee’ah uses the Arabic
    months for the dates of fasting, Hajj, I’tikaaf and so on. Beginning with the Hijri
    date is also a manifestation of the symbols and features of Islam among those who do not
    know them. And Allaah knows best.","Al-Lu’lu’ al-Makeen min Fataawaa al-Shaykh Ibn Jibreen, p. 53"

Is their interpretation of hadeeth, “Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it” correct??",,,"Praise be to Allah.What is obligatory is to fast when the sighting of the moon is confirmed, even if it is seen by only one trustworthy Muslim, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) issued orders to fast when a Bedouin testified that he had seen the new moon. Interpreting the hadeeth “Fast when you see it and stop fasting when you see it” as meaning that no individual should fast until he sees the new moon for himself is incorrect, because the hadeeth is telling everyone to fast when the sighting is confirmed, even if only one trustworthy Muslim sees the new moon.
(Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 10/94).
Further evidence that the sighting of the new moon by one trustworthy, reliable Muslim is sufficient for fasting to be obligatory on all the people is the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “The people went out to sight the new moon and I told the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that I had seen it, so he fasted and told the people to fast.”
(Reported by Abu Dawood in his Sunan, Kitaab al-Sawm, Baab fi Shahaadat al-Waahid ‘ala ru’yat hilaali Ramadan).
Some of those who follow bid’ah delay fasting until after all the other Muslims have started to fast, because of their misguided belief that fasting is not obligatory on a person until he sees the new moon for himself. The ahaadeeth refute this, and we would ask them moreover: what are those who are blind or who have poor eyesight supposed to do? It is as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “…Verily, it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts which are in the breasts that grow blind.” [al-Hajj 22:46].
