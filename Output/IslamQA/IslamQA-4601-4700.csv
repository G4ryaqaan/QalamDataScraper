4601,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4601,"She argues
    defiantly with her husband in discussions on fiqh","A wife is constantly arguing with her
      husband about matters of the deen for which there are 2 legal opinions. This is upsetting
      the husband and could break up the marriage.She says I can argue with you because the wives of the Prophet often
      used to challenge and argue with him. However, she is often too ""up-front"" and
      disrespectful.What advice can you offer this couple, in particular the wife?Please, answer this question as this is turning into a bad situation
      between the spouses.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The advice we give to these two spouses is that they are
    both creatures who should submit themselves to the laws of Allaah, because this is where
    happiness lies. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as
    regards living expenses, etc.) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards
    obedience and respect, etc.) to what is reasonable…” [al-Baqarah 2:228] 
So both spouses must treat the other kindly. Marriage is based on
    love, not on defiance or provocation, because these usually occur between enemies, and if
    they happen between people who love one another, they usually cause hatred and do the
    couple no good. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives
    from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you
    affection and mercy…” [al-Room 30:21]
So the husband should debate with his wife in a gentle manner, and
    approach her with the intention of winning her over, not of imposing his views. He should
    give her room for polite debate, and he should realize that it is not right for him to
    impose any view on her in a matter of fiqh that concerns her alone. He has nothing to do
    with it if she is convinced of a different scholar’s opinion, and she is permitted to
    follow that scholar. The wife must be aware that the husband’s rights are great, that
    obeying him is obligatory and that pleasing him is part of pleasing Allaah. ‘Abd
    al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Awf said: “The Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) said: ‘If a woman prays her five (daily prayers), fasts her month
    (Ramadaan), guards her modesty and obeys her husband, it will be said to her, “Enter
    Paradise through whichever gate of Paradise you wish.”’” (Reported
    by Imaam Ahmad, 1573; Saheeh al-Jaami’, 660). The Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also said, “If I were to command anyone
    to prostrate to anything other than Allaah, I would have commanded women to prostrate to
    their husbands. By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, no woman will fulfil her
    duty towards her Lord unless she fulfils her duty towards her husband, and if he asks her
    for herself when she is sitting on a saddle, she should not refuse him.” The phrase
    “he asks her for herself” refers to the husband asking for intercourse, and the
    phrase “on a saddle” refers to the saddle used for riding a camel. The hadeeth
    is urging women to obey their husbands and if they cannot refuse them when they are in
    this situation (i.e., about to ride off on a camel) then how can they refuse them in other
    cases? (Hadeeth reported by Ibn Maajah, 1843; see also Saheeh al-Jaami’,
    5239, 5295). The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
    “It is not right for any human being to prostrate to another; if it were right for
    one human being to prostrate to another, I would have commanded women to prostrate to
    their husbands because of the great rights that they have over them. By the One in Whose
    hand is my soul, if a man were covered from head to foot with weeping sores oozing pus,
    and his wife were to come to him and lick his sores (to clean them), this would not fulfil
    the rights he has over her.’” (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 12153; Saheeh
    al-Jaami’, 7725). 
    If the wife obeys her husband and treats him well for
    the sake of Allaah, she will earn a great reward with Allaah. By the same token, the man
    has to be patient with her, treat her well, win her over and teach her what his
    shar’i rights over her are.
With regard to her comment that the wives of the Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to argue with him a lot and challenge him, this is
    not right at all. They are far above such things. They asked him to spend on them at a
    time when he had nothing, and he did not have to spend more than Allaah had bestowed upon
    him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Let the rich man spend according to his means, and the man
    whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allaah has given
    him…”[al-Talaaq 65:7]
After this, they never repeated their demands again, may Allaah be
    pleased with them.
One time, the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    entered upon one of his wives and she gave him honey to drink. Two other wives got jealous
    because he stayed there for a long time, just to drink the honey. So they agreed that each
    of them would say that she could smell an unpleasant odour and would comment that the bees
    that had produced this honey had eaten from a tree that was not good. The Prophet 
 (peace
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was always anxious about having an unpleasant odour.
    Allaah rebuked them when He said (interpretation of the meaning):
“If you two (wives of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him), namely ‘Aa’ishah and Hafsah) turn in repentance to Allaah,
    (it will be better for you), your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) likes), but if you help one another
    against him (Muhammad 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)), then verily, Allaah
    is his Mawla (Lord, or Master, or Protector, etc.), and Jibreel, and the righteous among
    the believers, - and furthermore, the angels – are his helpers.” [al-Tahreem
    66:4]
So they never did such a thing again, may Allaah be pleased with
    them. So how can this woman forget about the good deeds of the Mothers of the Believers
    and their good treatment of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him),
    which are so well known, and fail to follow their example in this, then try to use as
    evidence the mistakes which some of them made, which were corrected by Allaah, and which
    they never did again?
May Allaah help you both to do that which He loves and which pleases
    Him, and may He reconcile between you.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

    So, both the guardian and the woman must agree to the
    marriage. With regard to your request for our advice regarding the problem mentioned in
    the question, so long as this marriage has taken place, it is better for the woman to try
    to keep it going as much as she can, and to try to accept this husband. She should seek
    reward through pleasing her parents and also try to reform her husband through a gentle
    approach and praying for guidance for him. And Allaah is the Source of Strength.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

      no trace of a Qu'ran being written in the 7 th century",,,"Praise be to Allah.This is a false and incorrectstatement made by those who try to find faults with
      Islam so as to put people off this religion. It is sufficient to know that
      Allaah has guaranteed to preserve the Qur’aan, as He says
      (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily,
      We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur’aan) and surely,
      We will guard it (from corruption).” [al-Hijr 15:9]
 Moreover, the fact that the transmission
      of the Qur’aan by memory and in writing was mutawaatir – narrated by
      groups to groups [to such anextent
      that so many people could not conceivably have agreed upon a lie] – is
      well known to anyone who has the slightest acquaintance with Islamic
      knowledge, especially knowledge of recitations and reciters. 
 There are still many people nowadays who
      have learned the Qur’aan orally, with isnaads directly going back to the
      Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).
 One of the miracles of Allaah’s
      protection of the Qur’aan is the fact that those who try to tamper with
      it are always found out.
 The point is, everything that was
      revealed to the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
      was written down in front of him straight away, and some of the Sahaabah
      had masaahif (written copies
      of the Qur’aan). After the death of the Prophet 
 (peace and
      blessings of Allaah be upon him), thefirst khaleefah, Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with
      him) gathered the Qur’aan inwritten
      and kept it. Then the third khaleefah, ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan (may
      Allaah be pleased with him) compiled it in mus-hafs that were based on the
      mus-haf compiled by Abu Bakr, in addition to what had been memorized.
When
      we realize that the Qur’aan was written down and compiled by the
      Sahaabah, and ‘Uthmaan sent copies of the Mus-haf during his reign to
      all the main centres of Islam, so that it would be a reference for them,
      and there were no disputes concerning them, then how can we say that there
      is no written trace of the Qur’aan in the seventh century? Moreover,
      there are several ancient manuscripts of the Qur’aan in libraries and
      museums which bear visible testimony to the fact that nothing has been
      changed in the Book of Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the
      meaning):
“And
      verily, it is an honourable well‑fortified respected Book (because
      it is Allaah’s Speech, and He has protected it from corruption).
      Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it, (it is) sent down

4610,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4610,Plucking and dyeing the    eyebrows,"I understand that plucking the eybrows is prohibited in Islam. I have the following questions. 1) Can the eybrow hairs be trimmed? 2) Can the eybrow hairs be lightened in color (for example from brown to blond)?
Please provided daleel.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Namas is the word used to describe plucking the eyebrows. According to a saheeh hadith, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The woman who plucks facial hair and the woman who has this done are cursed.” (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).
Namas means plucking the hair, or it was said that it means plucking the facial hair. “The woman who plucks facial hair” is the woman who removes hair from her own face or the face of another woman. “The woman who has this done” refers to a woman who plucks hair from her own face or tells another woman to do this for her. Minmaas refers to tweezers, the tool used to remove a thorn. When a woman removes hair from her face, this can also be done by using a thread. This also includes thinning the eyebrows.
The fuqaha’ agreed that plucking the eyebrow hair is included in the removal of facial hair, which is forbidden because of the hadith: “Allah has cursed the women who pluck their facial hair and the women who have this done.”
The majority of fuqaha’ said that removing facial hair other than the eyebrows is also included in Namas, and the fuqaha’ agreed that the prohibition on Namas in the hadith should be understood to mean that it is haraam.
Removing facial hair is also forbidden for men. (Al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, part 14, Tanammus).
Al-Haytami said: as for removing some of the eyebrow hairs if they have grown long, I do not see anything wrong with this according to our companions, but it should be makrooh because it is changing the creation of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. Nothing concerning this was narrated so it should be makrooh. (Al-Fatawa al-Kubra by Ibn Hajar al-Haytami, part 4, Baab al-‘Aqeeqah).
If the eyebrows have grown so long that they are troublesome or causing harm such as preventing one from seeing properly, then the part that is causing the problem may be trimmed.
With regard to dyeing the eyebrows or a part of them with a blonde colour or a colour similar to that of the skin, there is nothing wrong with this, as was stated in a fatwa issued by our Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allah ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him and raise his status). He also stated in a fatwa that it is permissible to remove hair growing between the eyebrows because this is not part of them, but he stated that it is not permissible to trim the eyebrows if they are not troublesome or causing harm.

“The correct view is that He taught him the names of all things, what they are, and their qualities, right down to the noiseless fart, i.e., the names and qualities of all things, great and small. Thus al-Bukhari said in his commentary on this aayah in Kitaab al-Tafseer in his Saheeh, and Ibn Katheer mentioned al-Bukhari’s isnaad from Anas, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The believers will assemble on the Day of Resurrection and will say, ‘Let us ask somebody to intercede for us with our Lord.’ So they will go to Adam and say, ‘You are the father of all the people. Allah created you with His own Hands, and ordered the angels to prostrate to you, and taught you the names of all things…’” This indicates that Allah taught him the names of all created things, which is why He then said (interpretation of the meaning): “… then He showed them to the angels” [al-Baqarah 2:31] – i.e., the objects whose names He had taught to Adam.”
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar listed various opinions on this topic in al-Fath (8/10), where he said, “There was some dispute as to the meaning of the ‘names.’ It was suggested that this referred to the names of his offspring, or the names of the angels, or the names of the different species – without going into details, or the names of everything on earth, or the names of all things, even a platter.”
Imaam al-Shawkaani said in Fath al-Qadeer (1/64): “The ‘names’ are phrases or expressions, and what is meant is the names of the objects whose names Allah taught him. This is the opinion of the majority of scholars, and this is the true meaning of the word ism (name). This is confirmed by the word all (all the names), which indicates that He taught him all the names and did not omit anything, no matter what it was.”

4631,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4631,Broken ties of kinship and  relationships,What is the meaning of silat al-rahm (upholding the ties of kinship)?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Islam calls for the upholding of the ties of kinship because of the great effect that this has on achieving social cohesion and perpetuating cooperation and love among the Muslims. Upholding the ties of kinship is a duty because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… and fear Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights), and (do not cut the relations of ) the wombs (kinship)…” [al-Nisa’ 4:1]
“And give to the kindred his due and to the miskeen (poor)…” [al-Isra’ 17:26]
Allah has warned us against cutting the ties of kinship (interpretation of the meaning):
“And those who break the Covenant of Allah, after its ratification, and sever that which Allah has commanded to be joined (i.e., they sever the bond of kinship and are not good to their relatives), and work mischief in the land, on them is the curse (i.e., they will be far away from Allah’s Mercy); And for them is the unhappy (evil) home (i.e., Hell).” [al-Ra’d 13:25]
What punishment could be worse than the curse and the evil home that awaits those who sever the ties of kinship ? They deny themselves the reward for upholding the ties of kinship in the Hereafter, in addition to denying themselves much good in this world, which is a long life and ample provision. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever would like his rizq (provision) to be increased and his life to be extended, should uphold the ties of kinship.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5986 and Muslim, 2557). Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Allah created the universe, and when He had finished, kinship (al-rahm) stood up and said, “This is the standing up of one who seeks Your protection from being cut off.” Allah said, “Yes, would it please you if I were to take care of those who take care of you and cut off those who cut you off?” It said, “Of course.” Allah said, “Then your prayer in granted.”’” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Recite, if you wish (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Would you then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the land, and sever your ties of kinship? Such are they whom Allah has cursed, so that He has made them deaf and blinded their sight.’ [Muhammad 47:22-23].” (Saheeh Muslim bi Sharh al-Nawawi, 16/112).
Once we understand this, we need to ask: who is the one who upholds the ties of kinship? This was explained by the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he said: “The one who maintains a relationship with his relatives only because they maintain a relationship with him is not truly upholding the ties of kinship. The one who truly upholds those ties is the one who does so even if they break off the relationship.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5645).
If the relationship is merely one of returning favours and giving like in return for like, and not taking the initiative, then this is not upholding the ties of kinship, it is only responding in kind. Some people follow the principle of giving a gift in return for a gift, and visiting in return for a visit, so if someone does not give them a gift, they do not give him a gift, and if he does not visit them, they do not visit him. This is not what is meant by upholding the ties of kinship at all, and this is not what is required by Islam. This is merely responding in kind, it is not the higher degree which Islam urges us to reach. A man said to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “I have relatives with whom I try to keep in touch, but they cut me off. I treat them well, but they abuse me. I am patient and kind towards them, but they insult me.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “If you are as you say, then it is as if you are putting hot dust in their mouths. Allah will continue to support you as long as you continue to do that.” (Reported by Muslim with commentary by al-Nawawi, 16/115). Who could bear to put up with hot dust?

4635,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4635,When should airplane passengers enter ihram?,"I intend to go for Hajj this year, if Allah wills, and I want to travel from Riyadh to Jeddah by air. When exactly should I enter ihram?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Your meeqaat in this case is Qarn al-Manaazil, which nowadays is called al-Sayl al-Kabeer. 
The one who passes by the meeqaat has to enter ihram from that point. If he does not pass it then he has to enter ihram when he comes in line with it on land, on the sea or in the air. So you have to enter ihram when the plane comes in line with it. As the plane will pass the meeqaat quickly, there is nothing wrong with entering ihram a little before that, in order to be on the safe side. 
Shaykh Ibn Jibreen said: 
If there is no meeqaat on a person’s route, he should enter ihram when he comes in line with the nearest place to it, whether he is coming by land, by sea or by air. Airplane passengers should enter ihram when they come in line with the meeqaat or, to be on the safe side, before they reach it, so that they will not pass it before entering ihram. Whoever enters ihram after passing the meeqaat has to offer a sacrifice. and Allah knows best. 
Fatawa Islamiyyah, 2/198 
From Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah: 
Jeddah is not a meeqaat for Hajj or ‘Umrah, except for its citizens and residents, and for those who come to it for a reason other than Hajj or ‘Umrah, then decide to go for Hajj or ‘Umrah. But those who have a meeqaat before Jeddah, such as Dhu’l-Hulayfah for the people of Madeenah and places beyond, or who come in line with it on land or in the air, or al-Jahfah for those who live there, or who come in line with it on land, on the sea or in the air, or such as Yalamlam as well, have to enter ihram from their own meeqaat or when they come in line with it in the air or on the sea or on land. 
Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah. 11/130 
The evidence for entering ihram from a point that is in line with the meeqaat is the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (1458) from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: When these two cities – meaning Kufa and Basrah – were conquered, they came to ‘Umar and said, “O Ameer al-Mu’mineen, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) defined the meeqaat for the people of Najd as being Qarn, but it is out of our way, and if we want to go to Qarn it is too difficult for us.” He said, “Look for a place on your route that is in line with it,” and he defined Dhaat ‘Irq for them (as their meeqaat). 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Baari (3/389): 
“Look for a place that is in line with it” means find a place that is parallel with the meeqaat and make that your meeqaat. 
It should be noted that it is not Sunnah to enter ihram before reaching the meeqaat, because this is not what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did, and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). But if a person is in a plane and cannot stop at the place that is in line with the meeqaat, then he may do what he thinks is more on the safe side so that he will not pass the meeqaat without being in ihram. 
Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
It was not narrated from any of those who performed Hajj with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that they entered ihram before Dhu’l-Hulayfah. If there was no meeqaat they then they would enter ihram before it, so this would be more difficult and would bring a greater reward.

    this world","Is the principle of pleasure forbidden
      in Islam? What is the view of Islam concerning physical pleasure, because the religion is
      a bunch of hard and strict duties.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The pleasures of this world are of three types.
Pleasures which will be followed by a greater pain, or which make a
        person miss out on a greater pleasure. These are the pleasures enjoyed by sinners and
        negligent people to varying degrees, such as those who enjoy zina (illegal sexual
        conduct), drinking wine, stealing, and so on. It will be said to them on the Day of
        Resurrection (interpretation of the meaning):

“You received your good things in the life of the world, and you
      took your pleasure therein…” [al-Ahqaaf 46:20]
Pleasures which will not be punished in the Hereafter, but
        overindulgence causes a person to miss out on achieving higher levels and keeps him from
        earning reward. These are the permissible pleasures of those who are negligent, which they
        do not do in order to better themselves or to earn reward, and they have no intention of
        worship when they do these things. Examples include going to extremes in matters of food,
        drink, transportation, accommodation, travelling and going on vacation, and other things
        that are not inherently harmful or sinful.
Pleasures for which a person will be rewarded. These pleasures belong
        exclusively to the believers who let themselves enjoy them on the grounds of doing their
        duty towards themselves, seeking help thereby to obey Allaah, and helping to keep
        themselves away from sin.
On the basis of these noble aims, these pleasures may be classified as
      acts of obedience towards Allaah, concerning which the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
      Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah will be pleased with a slave who eats some food
      then praises Allaah for it, and drinks some drink then praises Allaah for it.” (Reported
      by Muslim, 2734, from the hadeeth of Anas). He also said. “In your
      intercourse with your wife, there is reward.” They said, “O Messenger of Allaah,
      can anyone of us have sexual enjoyment and be rewarded for that?” He said, “Do
      you not see that if you do that in a haraam manner, you will be punished for it? So if you
      do it in a halaal manner, you will be rewarded.” (As in the hadeeth of Abu
      Dharr, reported by Muslim, 1006).
      It is clear from the hadeeth that enjoying these worldly
      pleasures on the basis of praising Allaah, recognizing His bounty and seeking to protect
      oneself from doing forbidden things will bring reward from Allaah. Praise be to Allaah for
      His blessings. (See Majmoo’ al-Fawaa’id by Ibn Sa’di, p.
      234). Thus we know that in Islam there are permissible pleasures, having to
      do with eating and drinking permissible foods and enjoying permissible kinds of clothing
      and means of transportation, and there are pleasures for which a person will be rewarded
      in the Hereafter, in addition to his enjoyment of them in this world, such as the one who
      eats with the intention of gaining the strength to obey Allaah, or who sleeps with the
      intention of helping himself to get up to pray Qiyaam al-Layl and Fajr, or the one who has
      intercourse with his wife with the intention of keeping himself and her chaste, keeping
      them both away from sin, and with the hope of having a child, or the one who works hard at
      his trade or job with the intention of spending on himself and his family and his parents,
      and so on. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, Allaah commands that you should render back the trusts to those, to whom they are due; and that when you judge between men, you judge with justice. Verily, how excellent is the teaching which He (Allaah) gives you! Truly, Allaah is Ever All-Hearer, All-Seer” [al-Nisaa’ 4:58]
“O you who believe! Betray not Allaah and His Messenger, nor betray knowingly your Amaanaat (things entrusted to you, and all the duties which Allaah has ordained for you)” [al-Anfaal 8:27]
In these aayaat there is the command to fulfil all kinds of trusts which people may be given. Fulfilling trusts and carrying them out properly is one of the greatest signs of faith.
 It was reported in al-Saheehayn from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The signs of the munaafiq (hypocrite) are three: when he speaks, he lies; when he makes a promise, he breaks it; and when he is entrusted with something he betrays that trust.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 32; Muslim, no. 89). According to a report narrated by Muslim (no. 90), “Even if he fasts and prays and claims that he is a Muslim.”
 This indicates that betrayal is a characteristic of the hypocrites. In al-Musnad it was narrated from Anas that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no eemaan (faith) for the one who cannot be trusted and there is no religion for the one who does not keep his promise.” (Musnad al-Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, no. 11935).
 The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray: “Allaahumma inni a’oodhu bika min al-joo’i fa innahu bi’s al-dajee’, wa a’oodhi bika min al-khiyaanah fa innahaa bi’sat il-bitaanah (O Allaah, I seek refuge with You from hunger, for it is the worst of bedfellows, and I seek refuge with You from betrayal, for it is the worst of companions).”
(Narrated by al-Nasaa’i, no. 5373; Abu Dawood, no. 1323; Ibn Maajah, 3345. Al-Albaani said, it is hasan saheeh. Saheeh Sunan al-Nasaa’i, 3/1112).
Maymoon ibn Mihraan said: “Three things are to be fulfilled for the righteous and impious alike: trust, promises and the upholding of family ties.”
Hence it is obligatory for an employee to remember that his Lord is always watching and to fulfil the trust of his work honestly, sincerely and carefully, so that his conscience will be clear, his earnings will be good (halaal) and his Lord will be pleased with him.
What you have mentioned about fiddling (with medical expenses, etc.) is a form of cheating, deception and betrayal which is not appropriate. “A believer may have any (bad) qualities apart from treachery and lying.” (Narrated by Imaam Ahmad, no. 21149, from the marfoo’ hadeeth of Abu Umaamah may Allaah be pleased with him).
So it is not permissible for you to manipulate the timings of your attendance at work, or to take sick leave when you are not sick, or to ask for things to which you are not entitled by giving false proof. All of that is haraam according to Islam, and is acting like the hypocrites. The fact that your boss or superior takes the matter lightly is not an acceptable excuse for doing something haraam. And Allaah knows best.

(5)With regard to the beard, it is obligatory to leave it alone and let it grow, in obedience to the command of the Messenger of Allaah, and ignore what they say.

    permissible for a person who adopts a child to give him his name as if he is his own son
    and a member of his tribe, as described in the question, because this involves lying,
    falsehood, the mixing of lineages and a threat to peoples honour, as well as
    distorting the channels of inheritance so that someone who is not entitled may receive an
    unfair share whilst depriving the rightful heirs of their due, and causing chaos in the
    sphere of relationships between mahram and non-mahram which affect issues of khulwah
    (being alone with a member of the opposite sex) and marriage. All of this violates
    sanctities and transgresses the bounds of shareeah. Hence Allaah forbade saying that
    a child belongs to anyone except his father or a slave belongs to anyone except his
    master. As Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning):
nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons.
    That is but your saying with your mouths. But Allâh says the truth, and He guides to the
    (Right) Way. Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just
    with Allâh. But if you know not their fathers (names, call them) your brothers in

    which you made a mistake, except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend. And
    Allâh is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. [al-Ahzaab 33:4-5]
The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    said:
Whoever knowingly claims to belong to anyone other than
    his father, Paradise will be denied him. (Narrated by Ahmad, al-Bukhaari and

    claims to be the son of anyone other than his father, or the slave of anyone other than
    his master, on him will be the curse of Allaah continually until the Day of

The one who is asking this question made a mistake when he
    tried to do the right thing by giving his name to the child. He cannot leave matters as
    they are; he has to try to change it and put matters right, because of the texts that
    state this naming is haraam, as quoted above. As for his feeling compassion for the child,
    bringing him up and treating him kindly, this is a good action which is encouraged in
    Islam. May Allaah bless our prophet Muhammad.","Al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/12-13"
