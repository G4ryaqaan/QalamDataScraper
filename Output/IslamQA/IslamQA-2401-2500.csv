    roof-top of the mosque (without the aid of amplifiers), that he has a good strong voice,
    that the one who hears him has good hearing, that the wind is calm and that there are no
    barriers or noise that will prevent the sound from reaching people, then the person who
    does not hear this call because of being far away is not obliged to attend the
    congregational prayer in the mosque. Imaam Ahmad estimated the distance at which the voice
    of the muezzin would be inaudible in such circumstances as being more than a farsakh (one

2424,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2424,The importance of being truthful,"What is the importance of being truthful, both in personal and business relationships, in Islam? Is lying ever considered and ""acceptable"" action?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Being truthful means speaking the truth and also saying things that
    reflect reality. 
Being truthful is one of the necessities of a human society, one of the
    virtues of human behaviour, and brings great benefits, whilst lying is one of the major
    elements of corruption in human society, and the cause of the destruction of social
    structure and ties, one of the most evil features of bad conduct, and causes widespread
    harm. Hence Islam commanded truthfulness and forbade lying.
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
O you who believe! Be afraid of Allaah, and be with those who
    are true (in word and deeds). [al-Tawbah 9:119] 
Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said (2/414): It
    means: be truthful and adhere to truthfulness, and you will be among its people and will
    be saved from calamity, and this will make a way out for you from your problems.
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
 if they had been true to Allaah, it would have been
    better for them. [Muhammad 47:21]
Abd-Allaah ibn Masood (may Allaah be pleased with him)
    said: The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
    You must be truthful, for truthfulness leads to righteousness and righteousness
    leads to Paradise. A man will keep speaking the truth and striving to speak the truth
    until he will be recorded with Allaah as a siddeeq (speaker of the truth). Beware
    of telling lies, for lying leads to immorality and immorality leads to Hellfire. A man
    will keep telling lies and striving to tell lies until he is recorded with Allaah as a
    liar. (Reported by Muslim, 4721)
    This hadeeth indicates that truthfulness leads to
    righteousness (al-birr), an all-embracing concept that includes all kinds of
    goodness and different kinds of righteous deeds. Immorality is basically an inclination
    towards deviation from the truth, and the immoral person (faajir) is one who is
    inclined to turn away from the path of guidance. Hence immorality and righteousness are
    diametrically opposed.
Al-Hasan ibn Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with them
    both) said: I memorized from the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah
    be upon him): Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you
    doubt, for truthfulness is certainty and tranquillity, whilst lying is doubt and
    confusion. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2520; al-Nisaa'i, 8/327; and Ahmad,
    1/200)
    In the lengthy hadeeth of Abu Sufyaan describing his
    meeting with Heraclius, Abu Sufyaan (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:
    [Heraclius] said, What does he [meaning the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him] command you to do? I said, He says: worship Allaah alone
    and do not associate anything in worship with Him, and abandon that which your forefathers
    did. He commands us to pray, to be truthful, to be chaste and to uphold the ties of
    kinship. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 1/30 and Muslim, 1773).
    Hakeem ibn Hizaam (may Allaah be pleased with him)
    reported that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Two
    parties to a deal have the option of changing their minds until they part; if they are
    open and honest, their deal will be blessed, and if they conceal and tell lies, the
    blessing of their deal will be diminished. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4/275
    and Muslim, 1532.)
    Truthfulness includes being truthful towards Allaah by
    worshipping Him sincerely; being truthful towards ones own soul by making it adhere
    to the laws of Allaah; and being truthful with people in one's words and by keeping one's
    promises, and in dealings such as buying, selling and marriage, so there should be no
    deceiving, cheating, falsifying or withholding of information. Thus a person should be the
    same on the inside and the outside.
As regards lying, it is highly forbidden, and is of varying degrees of
    abhorrence and sin. The most obnoxious form of lying is falsely attributing things to
    Allaah and His Messenger, because this involves fabrication about the religion and is an
    act of outrage against Allaah. Hence one of the characteristics of the Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) is that he truthfully conveyed that which Allaah
    commanded him to convey. So Allaah said (interpretation of the meanings):
 who does more wrong than one who invents a lie against
    Allaah, to lead mankind astray without knowledge. Certainly Allaah guides not the people
    whi are zaalimoon (polytheists and wrong-doers, etc.) [al-Anam 6:144]
And who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against Allaah?
    Such will be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, These are the
    ones who lied against their Lord! No doubt! The curse of Allaah is on the zaalimoon
    (polytheists, wrong-doers, oppressors, etc.). [Hood 11:18]
Equally bad is lying about the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him), as he is reported to have said in the mutawaatir hadeeth:
    Whoever lies about me deliberately, let him take his place in Hell. (Agreed
    upon).
    The basic rule with regard to lying is that it is not
    permitted, but there are certain circumstances in which Islam permits lying to serve a
    greater purpose or to prevent harm.
One of these situations is when a person mediates between two disputing
    parties in order to reconcile between them, if reconciliation cannot be achieved in any
    other way. Um Kalthoom (may Allaah be pleased with her) reported that the Prophet 
 (peace
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: He is not a liar who reconciles between
    people and conveys something good or says something good. (Reported by
    al-Bukhaari, 2495).
    Another example is a mans speaking to his wife, or
    a woman speaking to her husband, with regard to matters that will strengthen the ties of
    love between them, even if that is accompanied by exaggeration. Asma bint Yazeed
    said: The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
    Lying is not permitted except in three cases: a mans speaking to his wife to
    make her happy; lying at times of war; and lying in order to reconcile between
    people. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1862; he said: it is a hasan hadeeth.
    See also Saheeh Muslim, 4717).
    One of the most important forms of both being truthful
    and lying is in the area of promises and covenants. Being truthful in promises and
    covenants is one of the characteristics by which the believers are known. Both promises
    and covenants involve saying something about an issue to confirm that you will do it,
    especially with regard to one's duties towards Allaah. Allaah says, praising some of His
    slaves (interpretation of the meanings): 
Those who are faithfully true to their amaanaat (all the
    duties which Allaah has ordained, honesty, moral responsibility and trusts, etc.) and to
    their covenants. [al-Muminoon 23:8]
 and who fulfil their covenant when they make
    it [al-Baqarah 2:177]
Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant
    with Allaah [i.e., they have gone out for jihad (holy fighting), and showed not their
    backs to the disbelievers], of them some have fulfilled their obligations (i.e., have been
    martyred), and some of them are still waiting, but they have never changed [i.e., they
    never proved treacherous to their covenant which they concluded with Allaah] in the
    least. [al-Ahzaab 33:23]
We ask Allaah to make us sincere and truthful in word and deed. And
    Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
2425,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2425,The benefits of circumcision outweigh the pain,"First I would like to thank you for
      operating such a service over the internet. I live in a relatively isolated part of the
      U.K and have had no joy from trying to get an answer to my query from the main Mosque in
      the U.K (Regents Pk. Mosque).
    I am a Muslim happily married to an English lady. We have a 9 month old
      baby boy. The time has come for me to decide whether or not he should have circumcision
      performed. I have read your previous replies about circumcision, from which I got my first
      answer that circumcision is 'Sunnah' and not farz. On a medical point of view I know that
      it is very hygienic if a person has circumcision and those without can experience
      infections etc. in later life. But this cannot be used as justification because it can be
      also argued that a persons appendices or toneless should be removed at birth because of
      the chance of them causing a problem in later life. My reasons of yes 'it is Islamic to
      have circumcision' are sometimes outweighed by 'why should I cause a young 9 month old
      baby pain'.What in your mind are the implications of not having cicumcision performed on
      my son for the sole reason that I will be causing a small defenseless boy pain like he has
      not experienced before?. How does Allah justify such pain? 
   I know that you are busy and you can't always reply to questions, but
      please put my question in a que if neccesary, but please do reply because I need to make a
      decision before it is too late for a safe operation to be conducted. Salam",,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, there are benefits of circumcision insofar as it is part of the sunan
    (ways) of the Prophets and is part of the sunan al-fitrah (acts that befit the
    natural state of man). It is cleaner and healthier in terms of urination and intercourse,
    and prevents infection, etc. These and other benefits far outweigh the pain caused, which
    is less for infants than for adults. 
Moreover, a number of the scholars have said that circumcision is
    obligatory for males. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his book al-Mughni:
    Circumcision is an obligation for men and an honour, not an obligation, for
    women. This is the opinion of a number of scholars. Ahmad said: It is more of
    an obligation for men, because if a man is not circumcised, this piece of skin will be
    dangling down over the head of the penis and it will be too difficult to clean left-over
    urine properly. It is not so strict in the case of women. Abu Abd-Allaah said:
    Ibn Abbaas used to be very strict in this matter, and it is reported that he
    said that no Hajj or salaah would be accepted, i.e., from the one who is not
    circumcised. Al-Hasan was more lenient; he said: If a person enters Islam, it
    is not essential for him to be circumcised. And he said: Black and white
    people embraced Islam, but not one of them was checked or forced to get circumcised.
The evidence that it is obligatory is the fact that covering the awrah
    (private parts) is obligatory, so if circumcision were not obligatory, it would not be
    permissible for the one who wants to be circumcised to uncover his awrah for
    this purpose. Circumcision is one of the signs of a Muslim, and like the other signs, it
    is obligatory. If an adult male embraces Islam and is afraid that circumcision would be
    harmful for him, then he is excused, because a person may be excused from ghusl,
    wudoo, etc., if he fears that they may be harmful for him, so it is more so in the
    case of circumcision. If a person is confident that it will not be harmful, then he has to
    do it. Hanbal said: I asked Abu Abd-Allaah about the Dhimmi (non-Muslim under
    Islamic rule) who embraces Islam: did he think that he should be circumcised? He said:
    There is no alternative to that (i.e. he has to). I asked: what if he or she
    is advanced in age? He said: It is better for him to be circumcised, because of the
    hadeeth: Ibraaheem was circumcised when he was eighty years old, and Allaah
    says (interpretation of the meaning):  it is the religion of your father
    Ibraaheem [al-Hajj 22:78]
So our advice to you is to go ahead and have your son circumcised by
    someone who is skilled and experienced. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
    upon him) said: Five things are part of the fitrah: circumcision, removing
    the pubic hair, trimming the moustache, cutting the nails, and plucking the armpit
    hair. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5441)

2427,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2427,Where should one    place one’s hands when standing up from rukoo’?,"As-Salaamu Alaikum! I was curious about whether we should place our hands back on our chest when coming up from bowing. I've heard two different opinions regarding this and I would like to know the strongest opinion, Insha Allah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This is one of the issues on which the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) have differed. Some of them think that placing the right hand on the left forearm when standing up from rukoo is sunnah mustahabbah (preferable) because of the general meaning of the hadeeth of Sahl ibn Sad al-Saaidi (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The people were told that a man should place his right hand on his left forearm in prayer. They said: the general meaning of the phrase in prayer makes it clear that when standing up from rukoo, one should place ones hands thus, because the qiyaam (standing) includes the standing both before rukoo and after, so a person should place his right hand on his left forearm in both qiyaams.
They said that during rukoo, the hands should be on the knees, in sujood they should be on the ground, in juloos (sitting) they should be on the thighs, and in qiyaam (standing) they should be on the chest. This is where the hands should be during the qiyaam before rukoo and after. The attitude of humility and proper conduct before the Lord requires this in both qiyaams, and this position is the furthest away from fidgeting. Other scholars think that the right hand does not have to be placed on the left forearm after standing up from rukoo, and their evidence is the fact that no specific report on this matter has been narrated, as well as the fact that the general meaning of qiyaam does not include standing up from rukoo, because this is a straightening of the back, not a standing (qiyaam), so the person should let his hands drop to his sides.
Some scholars say that a person has the choice of placing his hands on his chest or not, because nothing clear has been reported in the Sunnah on this point. This is the opinion of Imaam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him.
The first opinion is more likely to be correct, in sha Allah, but in any case, either way is valid. Differences in such matters should not lead to reprehensible disputes and conflict, or accusations of bidah if someone does this, or of neglecting the Sunnah if he does not. Such comments can only be made in cases where there is a clear saheeh text and definite evidence.
For more information on this matter, see:
Al-Furoo by Ibn Muflih, 1/433; al-Insaaf by al-Mirdaawi, 2/63; Sharh Muntaha al-Iraadaat, 1/185; al-Sharh al-Mumti by Ibn Uthaymeen, 3/146. The hadeeth scholar Shaykh Badee al-Deen al-Sindi wrote a paper specifically on this topic in which he supported the opinion that it is sunnah to place the right hand on the left forearm after standing up from rukoo: Ziyaadat al-Khushoo bi wad al-Yumna alal-Yusra bad al-Rukoo. Shaykh Abd al-Azeez ibn Abd-Allah ibn Baz also wrote a paper on this topic, in which he supported the idea of putting the hands on the chest after standing up from rukoo.

      getting married (who is still christain) does that person attend the ceremony? 
      Thank you very much and please cite your sources.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Before answering this question, we should advise you of the importance
    of wisdom in denouncing evil, and of being careful not to inadvertantly promote
    anti-Islamic websites so that everyone will go and read them, because this will indirectly
    contribute to the promotion of these worthless people who claim to imitate the
    Qur’aan. 
Producing anything like the Qur’aan is impossible, because Allaah
    challenged anyone to do this. This challenge was issued to the most brilliant and eloquent
    Arab poets at the time when the Qur’aan was revealed, which was also the time when
    Arabic eloquence was at its peak. Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): “Let
    them then produce a recital like unto it (the Qur’aan) if they are truthful.” [al-Tur
    52:34]
When they could not do this, Allaah challenged them to produce ten
    soorahs like its soorahs: “Or they say: ‘He (Muhammad) forged it (the
    Qur’aan).’ Say: ‘Bring you then ten forged soorahs (chapters) like unto it,
    and call whomsoever you can, other than Allah (to your help), if you speak the
    truth!’” [Hud 11:13 – interpretation of the meaning].
When they could not do this, Allah challenged them to produce just
    one soorah that contained the same eloquence and wisdom as the Qur’aan. He said
    (interpretation of the meaning): “Or do they say: ‘He (Muhammad) has forged
    it’? Say: ‘Bring then a soorah (chapter) like unto it, and call upon whomsoever
    you like, besides Allah, if you are truthful!” [Yoonus 10:38]
Allah called on them to seek help from whoever they wanted, and to
    accept the challenge. He said (interpretation of the meaning): “And if you (Arab
    pagans, Jews, Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down to Our
    slave (Muhammad), then produce a soorah of the like thereof and call your witnesses
    (supporters and helpers) besides Allah, if you are truthful.” [al-Baqarah 2:23]
When they were unable to do this, Allah informed them that they
    would never be able to do it, no matter who they called upon to help them. He said
    (interpretation of the meaning): “Say: ‘If mankind and jinn were together to
    produce the like of this Qur’aan, they could not produce the like thereof, even if
    they helped one another.’” [al-Isra’ 17:88]
There is no one except Allah who can produce the like of the
    Qur’aan, because the Qur’aan, as He says, is “a Book, the Verses whereof
    are perfected and then explained in detail from One Who is All-Wise and Well-Acquainted
    (with all things).” [Hud 11:1 – interpretation of the meaning].
When some liars did try to imitate the Qur’aan they came up
    with ridicualous nonsense that would make children laugh, let alone mature and intelligent
    adults. For example, the liar Musaylimah said: “O frog, daughter of two frogs, croak
    as much as you want, your upper part is in the water and your lower part is in the
    mud.” This is an example of the kind of thing said by him and other pretenders to
    Prophethood. (See Sayd al-Khaatir by Ibn al-Jawzi, p. 404).
    Some forms of falsehood may deceive some of the people
    because of their ignorance and lack of understanding of the rules of grammar and accepted
    styles of eloquence in Arabic. But anyone who has intelligence and common sense should at
    least be able to see the difference and realize that these made-up words cannot possibly
    be Qur’aan. If we look at the Website referred to in the question, we see that kufr
    is quite clearly mentioned in these fabricated soorahs, such as the statement that the
    Messiah is the son of God or is God, and the promotion of the evil madhhab of Raafidah (a
    kind of Shi’ah), and other such nonsense. There are also some weird contradictions,
    for example, these liars say in the so-called sixth aayah of the so-called “soorah
    al-tajassud”: “Exalted be He above taking any of His creation as a son,”
    but then we find in the so-called ninth aayah of the so-called “soorah
    al-eemaan” the words: “You are he, the son of God, truly; in you we
    believe.” But verily Allah has spoken the truth when He said (interpretation of the
    meaning): “Do they not then consider the Qur’aan carefully? Had it been from
    other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much contradictions.” [al-Nisaa’
    4:82]
You also find other silly comments in these made-up soorahs, such
    as the claim that Allah permitted His Prophet to change whatever he wanted in the
    Qur’aan, as in the so-called sixth aayah of the so-called “soorah
    al-wasaaya”: “Abrogate whatever you want to abrogate of the commands that We
    have given you, for We permit you to make changes to Our decisions”!
Every Muslim will realize the extent of the lies contained in these
    words that come from this mind that is driven by ulterior motives. Have you ever seen
    anything more foolish than these words? Allah has told us to adhere to His Book and put it
    into practice, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “And this is a blessed
    Book which We have sent down, so follow it and fear Allah, that you may receive
    mercy.” [al-An’aam 6:155] 
He commanded His Messenger to adhere to the Qur’aan, saying
    (interpretation of the meaning): “So hold you (Muhammad) to that which is inspired
    in you. Verily, you are on a Straight Path.” [al-Zukhruf 43:43]. 
Allah warned His Messenger not to fail in conveying the message
    complete and unaltered, as He said (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, they
    were about to tempt you away from that which We have revealed unto you (O Muhammad), to
    fabricate something other than it against Us, and then they would certainly have taken you
    for a friend! And had We not made you stand firm, you would nearly have inclined to them a
    little. In that case, We would have made you taste a double portion (of punishment) in
    this life and a double portion (of punishment) after death. And then you would have found
    none to help you against Us” [al-Isra’ 17:73-75] and “… if he
    (Muhammad) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allah), We surely should have seized
    him by his right hand (or with power and might), and then certainly should have cut off
    his life artery (aorta)” [al-Haaqqah 69:44-46]. Having said all this, how can
    there be any so-called soorah that says the messenger has the right to abrogate whatever
    he wants in the Qur’aan and that he has the authority to change or omit whatever
    rules he wants??
The only One Who can abrogate whatever He wants of the Qur’aan is
    the One Who revealed it, may He be glorified, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah
    blots out what He wills and confirms (what He wills). And with Him is the Mother of the
    Book” [al-Ra’d 13:39]; 
“Whatever a Verse (revelation) We abrogate or cause to be
    forgotten, We bring a better one or similar to it. Know you not that Allah is able to do
    all things?” [al-Baqarah 2:106]. 
We, like our Messenger, are obliged to understand and implement the
    Qur’aan without distorting, omitting or changing anything. Allah said (interpretation
    of the meaning): “(This is) a Book which We have sent down to you, full of
    blessings that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may
    remember.” [Saad 38:29].
We have seen in the false soorahs quoted on that Internet website a
    real example of what is referred to in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “And
    verily, among them is a party who distort the Book with their tongues (as they read), so
    that you may think it is from the Book, but it is not from the Book, and they say:
    ‘This is from Allah,’ but it is not from Allah; and they speak a lie against
    Allah while they know it.” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:78].

    friends victorious, as We ask Him to defeat and humiliate His enemies and cause them to

It is an act of obedience: Loving the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is an act of obedience to Allah and a means of drawing closer to Him.
It is an obligation: Loving the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is one of the obligatory duties in Islam. 

Anas said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “None of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him than his father, his child and all the people.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 15; Muslim, 44) 
How to Increase Our Love for Prophet Muhammad
You can increase your love of Prophet Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) by realizing that: 

Prophet Muhammad was sent by his Lord Who chose him above all of creation to convey the religion of Allah to mankind. Allah chose him because He loved him and was pleased with him. If Allah were not pleased with him, He would not have chosen him. So we must love the one whom Allah loves and be pleased with the one with whom Allah is pleased. We must realize that he is the close friend (Khalil) of Allah and that close relationship is a higher status and it is the highest degree of love. 

Jundub said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “I declare before Allah that I have no close friend (Khalil) from among you. Allah has taken me as a close friend as he took Ibrahim as a close friend. If I were to have taken a close friend from among my Ummah, I would have taken Abu Bakr as a close friend.” (Narrated by Muslim, 532)

Allah has raised the status of Prophet Muhammad very high, for he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the best of mankind. 

Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I will be the leader of mankind of the Day of Resurrection, the first whose grave will be opened, the first to intercede and the first to be asked to intercede.”  (Narrated by Muslim, 2278) 

He suffered trials and difficulties in order to bring Islam to us. We should remember that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was persecuted, hit, slandered and insulted; the closest people to him disowned him and accused him of being a madman, a liar and a sorcerer. He fought the people in order to protect the religion so that it could reach us; they fought him, expelled him from his people and homeland, and gathered armies against him.  
We should follow the example of his companions who loved him deeply. They loved him more than their wealth, children, and their own selves. There follow some examples of that: 

Anas said: “I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when the barber was cutting his hair and his companions were going around him wanting to ensure that his hair would fall only into someone’s hand.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2325) 
Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “On the Day of Uhud some of the people fled and left the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but Abu Talhah stood before him covering him with a shield. Abu Talhah was a powerful archer who broke two or three bows that day. When a man passed by carrying a quiver containing arrows, he would say: Give them to Abu Talhah. Whenever the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) raised his head to look at the people, Abu Talhah would say: O Prophet of Allah, may my father and my mother be sacrificed for you, do not raise your head lest you be struck by an arrow shot by the enemy. My neck is before your neck.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 3600; Muslim, 1811) 

You should follow his Sunnah in word and deed, so that his Sunnah is the path you follow in your whole life, and you put his words before any other words and put his command before everything else; and you should follow the `Aqidah (belief) of his noble Companions, and the `Aqidah of the Tabi’in who followed them, and the `Aqidah of those who followed their path until the present day, namely Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah, and avoid Bid’ah (religious innovation), especially the Rafidis (Shi`ah), for their hearts are hardened against the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and they give their Imams precedence over him and love them more than they love him.  

We ask Allah to help us to love His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and to make him dearer to us than our children, parents, families and our own selves.

The Qur'aan was sent as a mercy for people, as a guidance and light, to guide to truth and 
righteousness and the Straight Path.
No one can believe that any person with religion or any mercy in his heart would split a 
pregnant woman's belly and take the infant out then kill it; kill children one by one in front of 
their parents; smash heads with axes; or, burn the living. Only a criminal with a heart harder than 
a stone which has no mercy, does not know Allaah, and does not believe in the hereafter would 
do such acts. It is not even possible for a sane person to believe that such a person is a 
Muslim. This is a fact that can't be hidden even if the person is disguised in Muslim clothing 
and grows a beard. Furthermore, it is not possible to call the killing of unarmed innocent 
Muslim villagers Jihaad. A Muslim--even while in Jihaad to establish the word of Allaah and in 
battle with the armies which stand to stop the spread of the word of Allaah--is absolutely not 
permitted to mutilate the dead; nor to kill a child; nor to kill a woman unless she bears weapons; 
nor to burn anyone with fire.

The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “Allah has sent down the disease and the cure, and has made for every disease the cure. So treat sickness, but do not use anything haram.”
2- The patient should not forget to put his trust in Allah and seek refuge in Him, for the gates of Heaven are open to those who call on Allah.",,"Praise be to Allah.Generally speaking, medical treatment or seeking a cure is allowed, because of the report of Abu’l-Darda (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Allah has sent down the disease and the cure, and has made for every disease the cure. So treat sickness, but do not use anything haram’” (Abu Dawud, 3376)
Usamah ibn Shurayk (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ‘The Bedouin said, “O Messenger of Allah, should we not treat sickness?” He said: “Treat sickness , for Allah has not created any disease except He has also created the cure, except for one disease.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, what is it?” He said: “Old age.”’” (Al-Tirmidhi, 4/383, no. 1961) He said: This is a sahih hasan hadith. See also Sahih al-Jami’, 2930)
 The majority of scholars (Hanafi and Maliki) said that medical treatment is permitted.  The Shafi`is, and al-Qadi, Ibn ‘Aqil and Ibn al-Jawzi among the Hanbalis, said that medical treatment is recommended, because of the hadith “Allah has sent down the disease and the cure, and has made for every disease the cure. So treat sickness, but do not use anything haram,” and other hadiths which contain instructions to seek cures.  
They said: the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used cupping and other kinds of treatment indicates that medical treatment is permitted.  
For the Shafi`is, treatment is mustahabb when there is no certainty that it will be beneficial , but when treatment is certain to be beneficial (such as putting a dressing on a wound), then it is obligatory (an example would be blood transfusions in certain cases).
(See Hashiyat Ibn ‘Abidin, 5/215, 249; al-Hidayah Takmilat Fath al-Qadir, 8/134; al-Fawakih al-Dawani, 2/440; Rawdah al-Talibin, 2/96; Kashshaf al-Qina’, 2/76; al-Insaf, 2/463; al-Adab al-Shar’iyyah, 2/359ff, Hashiyat al-Jumal, 2/134)
 Concerning the sahih hadiths that speak about medical treatment , Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
“This does not contradict tawakkul (putting one’s trust in Allah), just as warding off hunger, thirst, heat and cold does not contradict tawakkul.  The essence of tawakkul is not complete without resorting to the means which Allah has set out in order for us to achieve results both according to His decree (qadr) and His laws (Shar`). 
Not using these means is contrary to tawakkul: it goes against and undermines the command and wisdom of Allah, although the one who neglects the means may think that this makes his tawakkul stronger. Ignoring the means is a sign of helplessness that goes against the true essence of tawakkul, which is that the heart relies on Allah to bring the slave whatever will benefit him in this world and the next, and to protect him from whatever may harm him in this world and the next. But along with this reliance, it is essential to take the appropriate means, otherwise he will be going against the wisdom and command of Allah.  Helplessness should not be taken as a sign of tawakkul, nor should tawakkul make a person helpless.” (Zad al-Ma’ad, 4/15. See al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 11/116)
In summary, therefore, seeking a treatment or cure is not obligatory according to the scholars, unless – according to some – it will definitely be of benefit.  Since in the situation described in the question there is no certainty that treatment will be of benefit, and indeed it is likely to cause suffering to the patient, then there is nothing at all wrong with not giving the treatment.  
The patient should not forget to put his trust in Allah and seek refuge in Him, for the gates of Heaven are open to those who call on Allah.  He may also seek treatment (ruqya) by reciting Quran , such as reading al-Fatihah, al-Falaq and al-Nas over himself.  This will benefit him psychologically and physically, as well as bringing him reward.  Allah is the Healer and there is no healer but He.

Do not leave any statue without eliminating it or any raised grave withour levelling it.”
(Reported by Muslim, 1609). So it is OK to break pictures of animate objects and get rid of them. As for the silver-plated vessels, it is not permissible to use them because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who drinks from a vessel of silver is gargling fire from Hell into his stomach.” (Reported by Muslim, 3846).

    over the proposal of his brother until the first one gives up or gives him
    permission.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4746).
    There follow quotations from Ibn Hijr’s commentary
    which will shed more light on the matter:
The majority of scholars said: This amounts to a prohibition… The
    Shaafi’is and Hanbalis said: it is prohibited when the woman proposed to, or her
    appointed guardian, has stated that she accepts the offer, but if she has stated that she
    rejects this offer, it is not prohibited. If the second man does not know the situation,
    then he is permitted to propose marriage, because the basic principle is that proposing
    marriage is something permitted… If the woman has not answered either way, it is
    permitted. Al-Tirmidhi reported from al-Shaafi’i that the meaning of the hadeeth is:
    if a man proposes to a woman and she likes him and accepts, no-one else should propose to
    her after that, but if he (the second man) does not know that she liked and accepted that
    proposal, there is nothing wrong with his proposing to her. The evidence for this is the
    story of Faatimah bint Qays, who did not tell (the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him)) that she had accepted the proposal of one (of two men who had
    proposed to her). If she had told him, he would not have advised her to marry someone
    other than the one she had chosen. If there is no word of acceptance or rejection from the
    woman, some of the Shaafi’is say that it is definitely permitted…
    Al-Shaafi’i said that in the case of a virgin, her silence indicates her acceptance
    of a suitor.
The hadeeth was interpretated as meaning that if the first man to propose
    gives permission to the second, it is no longer prohibited for him to propose. … It
    was reported from Ibn al-Qaasim, the companion of Maalik, that if the first suitor is
    immoral, a chaste man is permitted to propose over his proposal. Ibn al-‘Arabi said
    that this was correct… This is applicable if the woman is chaste, because an immoral
    man would not be compatible for her, and his proposal would be like no proposal at all.
The phrase “until he marries her”* means until the first suitor
    has gone ahead and married her, so that anyone else will realize that there is no longer
    any point in proposing; “or gives up” means that the first suitor decides not to
    go ahead, in which case it is permitted for the second to offer his proposal.

It is reported in the Sunnah how a Muslim should purify these things if that happens.
Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: If a dog licks the vessel of any one of you, let him throw away its contents, then wash it seven times. Muslim added: the first time with earth. (Al-Bukhari bi Hashiyat al-Sindi, 1/44; Muslim, 1/234)
The meaning of the word translated here as lick means if a dog puts its tongue into water, or whatever, regardless of whether or not it actually drinks. The hadith refers to vessels , but the scholars did not distinguish between vessels and other things in this regard. Al-Iraqi said: “Vessels are mentioned because this is the usual scenario.”
The vessel or garment must be washed seven times, one of them being with earth. This is the opinion of Ibn ‘Abbas and Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with them), according to one report.

It is not the last washing that has to be done with earth , so there is no room for the objection mentioned in the question that this will make the clothes dirty.

What should be done after emission of maniy and madhiy?


Are maniy and madhiy pure?


Ruling on clothing on which there is maniy and madhiy","Praise be to Allah.The difference in qualities between maniy and madhiy
Semen in the case of men is a thick , white liquid, and in the case of women it is thin and yellow.
Umm Sulaym (may Allah be pleased with her) asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about a woman who sees a dream like a man sees (i.e., an erotic dream). The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If a woman sees that, she should do ghusl . Umm Sulaym said: I felt shy when I heard that. She asked, is that possible? The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: How else would the child resemble his father or mother? The water of the man is thick and white, and the water of the woman is thin and yellow. Whichever of the two prevails or comes first decides which parent the child will resemble.” (Agreed upon. Sahih Muslim, 469)
In his commentary on Sahih Muslim (3/222), Imam al-Nawawi said, concerning the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ‘The water of the man is thick and white, and the water of the woman is thin and yellow’: 
“This is an important criterion in describing maniy. This description applies when a person is healthy, and in most cases. The scholars said: when a man is healthy, his semen is white and thick, and gushes out in spurts accompanied by feelings of pleasure. After it has come out, it is followed immediately by a feeling of being drained and exhausted. Its smell is like that of palm tree pollen, which in turn resembles the smell of dough (the colour of semen may change for a number of reasons, including the following): If a person is sick his semen may become thin and yellow, or his testicles may become slack or soft, with the result that the emission of semen is not accompanied by any feelings of pleasure. If a man engages in intercourse too frequently, his semen may become red and resemble the juice that comes from meat, or may even contain pure blood. 
There are three distinguishing features of semen, the presence of any of which is sufficient for it to be classified as semen: firstly, its emission is accompanied by feelings of pleasure and is immediately followed by exhaustion; secondly, it smells like palm tree pollen, as stated above; and thirdly, it gushes out in spurts. Each one of these three characteristics is sufficient for it to be defined as semen; it is not necessary for all three features to be present. If none of them are present, the substance cannot be described as semen and in all likelihood it is not. All of the above applies to the maniy of men; in the case of women, their maniy is thin and yellow, although it could become white if the woman is strong. It has two distinguishing characteristics, either of which is sufficient to class the substance as maniy: firstly, it smells like the maniy of men, and secondly, its emission is accompanied by feelings of pleasure and is immediately followed by exhaustion.
Madhiy , on the other hand, is a sticky white fluid that is emitted when a person is thinking of or desiring intercourse. Its emission is not accompanied by feelings of pleasure, it does not gush out in spurts, and it is not followed by exhaustion. This may happen to men and women alike, although it is more common among women. This is the comment of Imam al-Nawawi in his commentary on Muslim” (Sharh Muslim, 3/213)
What should be done after emission of maniy and madhiy?
When maniy is emitted, a person must perform ghusl to clean himself from sexual impurity (janabah), whether this happened during intercourse or otherwise, whether he was awake or it happened because of an erotic dream. Madhiy, on the other hand, means that a person only needs to do wudu . The evidence for this is the report of Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I was a man who used to experience a lot of urethral discharge, so I told Miqdad to ask the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about it. So he asked him, and he said: It requires wudu. (Agreed upon; this version was narrated by al-Bukhari). Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni (1/168), Ibn al-Mundhir said: The scholars agree that passing stools or urine, the emission of madhiy or passing wind are all things that invalidate taharah (purity) [i.e. they mean that wudu must be renewed].
Are maniy and madhiy pure?
Maniy is pure according to the most correct opinion among the scholars. The evidence for this is the report of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to wash the maniy (from his clothes) then go out to pray wearing the same clothes, and I could see the spot where he had washed it. (Agreed upon) 
According to a report narrated by Muslim: I used to rub it (semen) thoroughly from the garment of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), then he would pray in it. According to another version: I would scratch it from his garment with my nail when it had become dry. 
It is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to leave it without washing it when it was wet; it was sufficient just to wipe it with ‘oud (a kind of aromatic wood) or something similar, as was reported by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad (6/243) from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to remove maniy from his garment with a twig of adhkhar (a kind of tree), then pray in that garment, and he would rub it from his garment once it was dry, and would pray in the same garment. Ibn Khuzaymah reported it in his Sahih, and Shaykh al-Albani classed it as hasan in al-Irwa (1/197).
Madhiy (urethral discharge) is impure, because of the Hadith of ‘Ali quoted above, in some versions of which it is reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded him to wash his penis and testicles and do wudu, as was reported by Abu Awanah in al-Mustakhraj. Ibn Hajar said in al-Talkhis: There is nothing at fault in this isnad. So madhiy is impure and the penis and testicles must be washed, as it nullifies taharah.
Ruling on clothing on which there is maniy and madhiy
As maniy is deemed to be pure, if it gets on a person’s clothes it does not make them impure, and if he prays in those clothes there is nothing wrong with that. 
Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni (1/763): “Even though we say manity is pure , it is better to rub it, but if one prays (in those clothes) without rubbing it, this is acceptable.”
In the case of madhiy, it is sufficient to sprinkle water on it , because of the difficulty of doing otherwise. The evidence for this is the Hadith narrated by Abu Dawud in his Sunan from Sahl ibn Hanif, who said: I used to experience a lot of urethral discharge, and I used to do ghusl a lot. I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about it and he said: It is sufficient for you to do wudu (to purify yourself) from that. I said, O Messenger of Allah, what about when it gets on my clothes? He said: It is sufficient for you to take a handful of water and sprinkle it on your clothes wherever you think (the madhiy) is. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi. He said: This is a sahih hasan Hadith, and the only other Hadith about madhiy that we know is the Hadith of Muhammad ibn Ishaq).
The author of Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi (1/373) said: “This may be taken to prove that if madhiy gets on one's clothes, it is sufficient to sprinkle water on it; one does not have to wash it.”

2459,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2459,Is It Permissible to Shake Hands with Opposite Gender?,Is it allowable for a Muslim woman to greet a Muslim man by shaking hands?,It is not permitted at all for a man to shake hands with a non-Mahram woman.,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permitted at all for a man to shake hands with a non-Mahram woman . Among the evidence for this is the Hadith of Ma`qal ibn Yasar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: `If one of you were to be struck in the head with an iron needle, it would be better for him than if he were to touch a woman he is not allowed to.” (Reported by At-Tabarani; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami`, 5045)
There is no doubt that for a man to touch a non-Mahram woman is one of the causes of Fitnah (turmoil, temptation), provocation of desire and committing prohibited deeds. 
No one should say that their intention is sound or their heart is clean, because the one who was the purest of heart and the most chaste of all, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) never touched a non-Mahram woman, even when accepting Bay`ah (oath of allegiance) from women. He did not hold their hands when accepting their Bay`ah, as he did with men; their Bay`ah was by words only, as was reported by his wife `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her). She said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would test the believing women who emigrated to him with the verse  (interpretation of the meaning): “O Prophet! When believing women come to you to give you the Bay`ah, that they will not associate anything in worship with Allah, that they will not steal, that they will not commit illegal sexual intercourse, that they will not kill their children, that they will not utter slander, intentionally forging falsehood (i.e., by making illegal children belong to their husbands), and that they will not disobey you in any Ma`ruf (Islamic monotheism and all that which Islam ordains), then accept their Bay`ah and ask Allah to forgive them. Verily Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Al-Mumtahinah 60:12] `Aishah said: “So whoever of the believing women agreed to these conditions, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would say to her: `I have accepted your Bay`ah by words.` By Allah, his hand never touched the hand of any woman when accepting their Bay`ah; he accepted their Bay`ah by saying `I have accepted your Bay`ah on this basis.`” ((Reported by Al-Bukhari, 4512) 
According to another report, he accepted their Bay`ah by words… the hand of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) never touched the hand of any woman except a woman he owned. (Reported by Al-Bukhari, 6674)
Some Muslims feel too embarrassed to refuse when a woman offers her hand to them. In addition to mixing with women, some of them claim that they are forced to shake hands with fellow-students and teachers in schools and universities, or with colleagues in the workplace, or in business meetings and so on, but this is not an acceptable excuse. 
The Muslim should overcome his own feelings and the promptings of the Shaytan, and be strong in his faith, because Allah is not ashamed of the truth. 
The Muslim could apologize politely and explain that the reason he does not want to shake hands is not to offend or hurt anybody`s feelings, but it is because he is following the teachings of his religion. In most cases this will earn him respect from others. There is no harm done if they find it strange at first, and it may even be a practical opportunity for Da`wah.

      I would be grateful if you guide me in this matter.
      I ask Allah for forgiveness and guidance for all who are alive and dead.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Since your grandmother has died and gone to her Lord,
    you cannot know whether she has forgiven you or not. There is no way that you can ask for
    her forgiveness now that she has died. This confirms the importance of the hadeeth of the
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him):
Whoever has wronged his brother with regard to his honour or
    something, let him ask him for forgiveness before the time when there will be neither dinar
    nor dirham, and if he has any good deeds it will be taken from him in proportion to
    the wrong he did, and if he does not have any good deeds (hasanaat), some of the
    other person's evil deeds (sayiaat) will be taken and given to him to
    bear. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 2296).
    Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his
    commentary on this hadeeth:
 Whoever has wronged his brother  i.e., if he
    has done something wrong to his brother.
with regard to his honour or something  i.e.,
    anything else this includes all kinds of wealth and wounding, even a slap in the
    face and so on. According to a report narrated by al-Tirmidhi, with regard to his
    honour or his wealth.
Before the time when there will be neither dinar nor dirham
     i.e., the Day of Resurrection.
Some of the other person's evil deeds (sayiaat) will
    be taken  i.e., they will be taken from the account of the person who was
    wronged  and given to him to bear  i.e., they will be added to the
    account of the wrongdoer.
Muslim also narrated a hadeeth similar in meaning to this through a
    different isnaad. This version is clearer in meaning: The one who is bankrupt among
    my ummah is the one who will come on the Day of Resurrection with prayer, fasting and
    zakaah to his credit, but he will come having slandered one person and shed the blood of
    another and wrongfully consumed the wealth of a third, so (his victims) will be given some
    of his hasanaat (good deeds), and if his hasanaat run out before the score is settled,
    some of their sins will be taken and thrown onto him, and he will be thrown into
    Hell.
According to a report also narrated by al-Bukhaari from Abu Hurayrah,
    the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever
    has done wrong to his brother, let him seek his forgiveness, because in the Hereafter
    there will be no dinar or dirham, and let him ask for his forgiveness before some of his
    hasanaat are taken and given to his brother, and if he has no hasanaat, some of his
    brothers sayiaat will be taken and thrown onto him. (Reported by
    al-Bukhaari, 6053)
Abu Naeem reported from Ibn Masood that a person will be
    taken by the hand and made to stand before all of mankind, and a caller will cry out:
    This is So and so the son of So and so. Whoever is owed anything by him, let him
    come forward. So they will come forward, and the Lord will say, Give them what
    is due to them. He will say, O Lord, the world is finished, so how can I give
    them anything? He [Allaah] will say to the angels, Take from his righteous
    deeds and give each one what he is asking for. If he is to be saved and there is
    even a mustard-seed worth of his hasanaat left over, Allaah will multiply it until He
    admits him thereby to Paradise.
Ahmad and al-Haakim reported from Jaabir from Abd-Allaah ibn
    Unays, who attributed it to the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him):
    No one of the people of Paradise will be allowed to enter Paradise when one of the
    people of Hell has been wronged by him, until I settle the score, even with regard to a
    slap in the face. We [the Sahaabah] said: O Messenger of Allaah, how will that
    be, when we will be gathered barefoot and naked? He said, By virtue of
    sayiaat and hasanaat. (Fath al-Baari Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhaari).
    In any case, you have taken a very important step, which

Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him that he had kissed or touched a woman, or something similar, as if he was asking how he could expiate for this (according to another report: a man had done something with a woman that fell short of actual intercourse. He came to `Umar ibn Al-Khattab, who regarded it as something very serious; then he came to Abu Bakr, who regarded it as something very serious. Then he came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)). Then Allah revealed the verse (interpretation of the meaning): And perform prayer at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds (i.e., small sins). That is a reminder (advice) for the mindful (those who accept advice). [Hood 11:114]. The man asked, Is this concerning me, O Messenger of Allah? He said: It is concerning whoever of my Ummah does this. (Reported by Muslim, may Allah have mercy on him, in his Sahih, 4963)

Here I am, judge me as you wish. Umar said to him: Allah had covered you, you should have covered yourself (i.e., you should not have spoken of it).

2491,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2491,A father puts the    condition that he should get something for himself in addition to the mahr which is agreed    to for his daughter at the time of the wedding contract (nikaah),There is a custom in some societies for the father to put the condition that he should get something for himself in addition to the mahr which is agreed to for his daughter when she gets married. Does he have the right to this or not?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: ‘Issue: if she gets married on the condition that she will get one thousand and her father will get one thousand, this is permissible, and if she is divorced before the marriage is consummated … the conclusion is that the father of the woman is allowed to put the condition that he will get some part of his daughter’s dowry for himself. This is the opinion of Ishaaq, and it was reported that when Masrooq married his daughter off, he put a condition that he would get ten thousand for himself, which he spent on Hajj and on the poor, then he said to the husband: “Provide your wife with what she needs [e.g., buy her clothes and furnish a house for her].” Something similar was reported from ‘Ali ibn al-Husayn.’
‘Ataa’, Tawoos, ‘Ikrimah, ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez, al-Thawri and Abu ‘Ubayd said: ‘All of the mahr is for the woman… because the mahr must not be given to anyone but the wife, as a compensation for intimacy with her…
Our evidence for this is the words of Allaah in the story of Shu’ayb, upon whom be peace (interpretation of the meaning): “He said: ‘I intend to wed one of these two daughters of mine to you, on condition that you serve me for eight years…’” [al-Qasas 28:27] Here the father, Shu’ayb, made his employing Moosa to look after his sheep his dowry, which was a condition that he would get something for himself. Moreover, a father has the right to take from the wealth of his child, on the basis of the Prophet’s words, “You and your wealth belong to your father,” and “Your children are among the best of your earnings, so consume from their wealth.” (Reported by Abu Dawood; a similar report narrated by al-Tirmidhi, who said, a hasan hadeeth). If a father puts the condition that he will get something for himself from the dowry, this means that he will be taking something from his daughter’s wealth, and he has the right to do this… A father has the right to take whatever he wants and leave whatever he wants, and he could take it   with this condition or without it… This is provided that he is not unfair in his taking from his daughter’s wealth; if he is being unfair, then the condition is not valid, and the entire dowry belongs to the bride.’
He also said (may Allaah have mercy on him): ‘Section: If any guardian other than the father, such as the grandfather, brother or (paternal) uncle puts such a condition, it is invalid. This is the opinion of Ahmad, and all the mahr agreed upon belongs to the bride.’","(al-Mughni, part 7, Mas’alah 5580)"
2492,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2492,Disposing of riba income received before one came to know that it is haram,"A person used to receive interest on his bank deposits. He later learnt it is forbidden (haram) and ceased to receive interest. Later on, he feels he should give out this money to complete the conditions for his repentance (tawba).
However, there are two problems :
1- He cannot calculate the exact amount of all the money
he previously obtained from bank interests.
2- The savings this person has now, are surely less than what
he obtained from bank interest over the years.
Given the above, please answer the following questions :
1- Is it a condition of this person's tawba to give out the exact equivalent of all the money he received from bank interest ?
2- If the answer to the first question is 'yes', then must he immediately give out any amounts as they become available (after providing basic needs for himself and his family) ?
i.e can this person buy things that are not strictly necessities ('Darooriyyaat' i.e. shelter, food, clothes, medicine, transportation) but that are still important ('haajaat', e.g. computer) ?
3- If the answer to the second part of the previous question is 'no', can this person perform hajj, before giving out the equivalent of this bank interest money, with any amounts that become available ?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
Those who eat riba (usury) will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaytaan, leading him to insanity. That is because they say: Trading is only like riba, whereas Allah has permitted trading and forbidden riba. So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating riba shall not be punished for his past; his case is for Allah (to judge); but whoever returns (to riba), such are the dwellers of the Fire they will abide therein.
[al-Baqarah 2:275]
Ibn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, said concerning the phrase So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating riba shall not be punished for his past: This means: whoever hears that Allah has forbidden riba should stop as soon as this ruling reaches him, but he can keep whatever he had received before, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): Allah has forgiven what is past [al-Maaidah 5:95]. Similarly, on the day of the Conquest of Makkah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: All riba owing from the time of Jaahiliyyah is under these two feet of mine (when he abolished everything that was owed to the usurers except their capital), he did not command them to return the extra money they had received during the time of Jaahiliyyah. (The phrase) (Allah) has forgiven what is past is akin to the phrase his case is for Allah (to judge). Saeed ibn Jubayr and al-Saddi said: Shall not be punished for his past (means) for what he used to consume of riba before it was prohibited.
(Tafseer Ibn Katheer; the material in brackets has been added for the purpose of clarification).
On the basis of the above, you do not have to repay the interest which you received before you found out that it is haram, but whatever you have received since then must be repaid if you still have it. If it has become mixed with your own money and you do not know the amount, then try to estimate what you think is most likely, and pay that amount.
