    Muslims and kaafirs leaving things to one another in their wills","What is the ruling on a Muslim
      leaving something to a kaafir in his will, so long as it does not exceed one-third of the
      estate? What is the ruling on the opposite, i.e., can a Muslim accept money from a kaafir
      if he leaves it to him in his will?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Hanafi, Hanbali and most of the Shaafa'i fuqahaa are agreed
    that it is OK for a Muslim to leave something to a dhimmi (non-Muslim living under Islamic
    rule) in his will, and vice versa, so long as this is within the guidelines of
    shareeah. Their evidence for this is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): Allaah
    does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on
    account of religion and did not drive you out of your homes. Verily, Allaah loves those
    who deal with equity. [al-Mumtahinah 60:8]. Also, being a kaafir does not
    disqualify a person from ownership, and as it is OK to sell to a kaafir or give him a
    gift, it is also OK to include him in ones will.
Some of the Shaafais think that it is OK only if a specific
    person is named, such as saying I leave [such and such] to so and so; but if a
    person says I leave [it] to the Jews and Christians, this is not OK because it
    sounds as if he is making their kufr the reason for leaving something to them. The
    Maalikis agree with others that it is OK for a non-Muslim to leave something to a Muslim.
    With regard to a Muslim leaving something to a non-Muslim, Ibn al-Qaasim and Ashhab said
    that it is allowed if it is done for a reason, such as upholding family ties, otherwise it
    is makrooh, and should not be done at the expense of a Muslim. No one would do such a
    thing except one whose faith is diseased. (al-Mawsooah al-Fiqhiyyah,
    2/312)
    Unfortunately, nowadays we see some Muslims, especially
    those who are living in kaafir countries, leaving huge sums of money to Christian, Jewish
    or other kaafir organizations, on the basis that these are charitable, educational or
    humanitarian organizations and so on, but there is no way that Muslims can benefit from
    this. The only ones who benefit from it are the kuffar, and their hungry oppressed refugee
    Muslim brothers are left with no h elp or support. This is a sign of weak, diluted faith
    and of allegiance to and admiration of the kuffaar and their disbelieving societies. We

      etc it is not necessary to continually clean up if it is too much of a strain and the
      person should do fresh wudo before every prayer. What if the prayer for some reason is
      prayed late eg if 'Asr is done 30 minutes before Maghrib, is a fresh wudo for maghrib
      necessary for this small time gap? Also if one does wudo for Juma'h prayer one hour early

    separate wudoo for each prayer when the time comes, even if he has just made
    wudoo for another prayer a short time before. This is because the Prophet 
    taught the woman who suffers from istihaadah (prolonged non-menstrual vaginal bleeding) to
    do this. Aaishah said: Faatimah bint Abi Hubaysh came to the Prophet
    
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allaah, I
    am a woman who experiences istihaadah and I do not become clean from bleeding. Should I
    forget about salaah? He said: No, that is from a vein; it is not menses. When
    your period starts, then stop praying, and when it ends, wash the blood from your body and
    pray again. Abu Muaawiyah said in his hadeeth: He said: Do
    wudoo for each prayer, until the time for the next prayer comes
    Abu Eesaa said: The hadeeth of Aaishah is a saheeh hasan hadeeth,
    and this is the opinion of more than one scholar among the Companions of the Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the Taabieen. It is also the opinion
    of Sufyaan al-Thawri, Maalik, Ibn al-Mubaarak and al-Shaafii that when the woman who
    suffers from istihaadah finishes her regular period, she should do ghusl, then do
    wudoo for each prayer. (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 116; the hadeeth was
    reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 221).
    Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The
    ruling on non-menstrual blood (istihaadah) is the same as the ruling on anything that
    breaks wudoo: she should do wudoo for each prayer, but she should not pray
    more than one fard prayer with that wudoo, whether she is praying on time or is
    making up the prayer later, because of the apparent meaning of the hadeeth, You
    should do wudoo for each prayer. This is the opinion of the majority of
    scholars. (Fath al-Baari, Kitaab al-hayd, Bab al-istihaadah).
    The same ruling applies to the person who suffers from continual incontinence or wind. You
    can pray as many naafil prayers as you like with the wudoo you made for a fard

2734,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2734,Is it possible to see Allah in this world?,"I have read that no man has seen Allah (S) in this life, not even the prophet (SM) in his mira'j. The book has been written by Sk. Abu Ameenah Bilaal Philips. Now, I have heard from one scholar from my country that Imam Malik saw Allah (S) hundred times in his dream. Is that possible?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Seeing Allah in reality (as opposed to in a dream) is not possible in this life, although no doubt it will happen after death. This is not because seeing Him is impossible in itself, but because Allah has willed that it should not happen. This is for many reasons, some of which have been found by the scholars, and others which remain known only to Allah. Among the reasons which we do understand is human weakness, which is apparent from the story of Moosa (upon whom be peace), which we will quote shortly. Another reason is that seeing Allah is a great blessing and joy, indeed it is the greatest blessing, so it is withheld for the place of ultimate blessing and joy, namely Paradise. Another reason is that this world is a mixture of good believers and kuffaar, so this blessing is deferred until it will be given exclusively to the believers in Paradise. Withholding this blessing until the Hereafter also provides a strong motive to do good in this world, so that one may see Allah and feel secure and content in nearness to Him in the Hereafter.
Evidence that it is not possible to see Allah in this world


Allah says, in the story of Moosa (peace be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): And when Moosa came at the time and place appointed by Us, and his Lord spoke to him, he said, O my Lord! Show me (Yourself), that I may look upon You. Allah said, You cannot see Me, but look upon the mountain, if its stands still in its place, then you shall see Me. So when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He made it collapse to dust, and Moosa fell down unconscious. Then when he recovered his senses he said, Glory be to You, I turn to You in repentance and I am the first of the believers. [al-Araaf 7:143]. The word lan (here translated as cannot in You cannot see Me) conveys the meaning of You will not see Me in this life, because there is evidence that man will see Allah in the Hereafter, which means that this lan is not eternal in application. (The negative particle lan often carries a sense of eternal negation, that something will never happen, but this is not the case here. Translator).


Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): No vision can grasp Him, but His Grasp is over all vision. He is the Most Subtle and Courteous, Well-Acquainted with all things. [al-Anaam 6:103]. The commentator al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said, in his tafseer of this aayah: Concerning the phrase No vision can grasp Him, several comments regarding it have been narrated from the imaams of the salaf, one of which is that it means, you will not be able to see Him in this world, even though you will see Him in the Hereafter. The reports that state this, narrated from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), reach the level of mutawaatir and are reported through more than one sound isnaad in the books of Saheeh, Musnad and Sunan.


[Translators note: a mutawaatir report is one that was narrated by so many to so many that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed on a lie].
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by inspiration, or from behind a veil, or (that) He sends a Messenger to reveal what He will by His Leave. Verily, He is Most High, Most Wise. [al-Shoora 42:51].
Abu Hurayrah said: Some people said, O Messenger of Allah, will we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection? He said, Do you have any doubt about seeing the sun on a cloudless day? They said, No, O Messenger of Allah. He said, Do you have any doubt about seeing the full moon on a cloudless night? They said, No, O Messenger of Allah. He said, You will see Him just as clearly on the Day of Resurrection
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6088). It is clear that the idea that Allah will not be seen in this life was well-entrenched in the minds of the Sahaabah. They were asking about the Hereafter, and this is what the Prophets answer also referred to.
Abu Dharr said: I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), Have you seen your Lord? He said, (There is) light, how could I see Him? This light, which prevented him from seeing Him, is a veil of light, which is further explained in the hadith of Abu Moosa, who said, The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood up and told us five things: Allah does not sleep, and it is not befitting that He should sleep. He lowers the scale and lifts it. The deeds in the night are taken up to Him before the deeds of the day, and the deeds of the day before the deeds of the night. His veil is the light. If He were to withdraw it (the veil), the splendour of His countenance would consume His creation as far as His sight reaches.
(Reported by Imaam Ahmad and Muslim, 263).
Further clear evidence comes in the hadith which warns against the Dajjaal (antichrist): Written between his eyes is (the word) kaafir, which will be read by everyone who hates his works, or every believer will read it. Know that none of you will see your Lord until he dies.
(Reported by Muslim, 5215).
So any claim that anyone but the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) can see Allah in reality is impossible, according to the consensus of the scholars. However, there is some disagreement among the scholars as to whether or not the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw Allah on the night of the Miraaj. The correct view is that he did not see Him physically, with his own two eyes, because when he was asked about this, he said, (There is) light, how could I see Him? According to another report, he said, I saw light. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not see Him, but he saw His veil of light.
The question of whether Allah may be seen in a dream does not contradict the fact that Allah cannot be seen in reality in this world, because all the texts quoted above speak about physical vision when one is awake, not the vision of the heart when one is asleep. Proof that the latter kind of vision is possible is to be seen in the hadith about the dispute of the chiefs on high (the angels). Ibn Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said, The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, My Lord came to me tonight in the most beautiful form. I think he said, in a dream. He said, O Muhammad, do you know what the chiefs on high disputed about? I said, No. He put His hand between my shoulder-blades and I could feel its coolness on my chest (or just beneath my throat), then I knew everything that is in the heavens and on earth. He said, O Muhammad, do you know what the chiefs on high disputed about? I said, Yes. He said, About expiation, and expiation is staying in the mosque after prayers, walking to join congregational prayers, and doing wudoo properly in adverse conditions. Whoever does that will live a good life and die a good death, and will be as sinless as the day his mother bore him. He said, O Muhammad, when you pray, say Allahumma innee asaluka fal al-khayraat wa tark al-munkaraat wa hubb al-masaakeen, wa idha aradta bi ibaadika fitnatan faqbudni ilayka ghayra maftoon (O Allah, I ask you to make me do good deeds and avoid evil deeds, and to make me love the poor and wretched. If You want to test Your slaves, then take me unto You without subjecting me to the trial). Ones status in Paradise may be raised by spreading the greeting of salaam, feeding others, and praying at night when people are sleeping.
(Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 16026; and by al-Tirmidhi, 3159, who said it is a saheeh hasan hadith).
Some of the scholars have commented that it is possible to see Allah in a dream.
Imaam al-Daarimi said, in his refutation of Bishr ibn Ghiyaath, This seeing took place in a dream, and in a dream it is possible to see Allah in any shape or form. (p. 166)
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said, A believer may see his Lord in a dream, in various forms according to his faith and belief. If his eemaan is correct, he can only see Him in a beautiful form, and if his faith is lacking, this will be reflected in the way he sees Him. Seeing Allah in a dream is not like seeing Him in reality. It may have different interpretations and meanings referring to something in reality.(al-Fatawa, 3/390)
He also said, Whoever sees Allah in a dream sees Him in a form that corresponds to his own state. If he is righteous, he will see Him in a beautiful form, which is why the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw him in the most beautiful form.(al-Fatawa, 5/251)
Shaykh Abd al-Azeez ibn Baz was asked about the ruling concerning one who claims to have seen the Lord of Glory in a dream, and whether it was true, as some claim, that Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal had seen the Lord of Glory in his dreams more than one hundred times. The Shaykh answered as follows:
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) and others said that it is possible for a man to see his Lord in a dream, but what he sees is not reality, because there is nothing like Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer. [al-Shoora 42:11]. Nothing in His creation is like unto Him. A person may dream that his Lord is speaking to him, and no matter what kind of image he sees, that image is not Allah, because there is nothing that is like Allah in any way. Shaykh Taqiy al-Deen (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned that dreams differ according to the state of the person who is dreaming. The more righteous and closer to goodness a person is, the more correct his dream will be, but the truth is still something other than what he sees, because the guiding principle is still that there is nothing like unto Allah.
He may hear a voice and be told such-and-such, or to do such-and-such, without any clear image resembling anything in creation, because there is nothing at all like unto Allah Some people may imagine that they have seen their Lord when in fact this is not the case. The Shaytaan may deceive a person and make him imagine that he is their Lord, as it was reported that he made Abd al-Qaadir al-Jeelaani see him on a throne above water, and said, I am your Lord and I freed you from doing any duties (worship, etc.). Abd al-Qaadir al-Jeelaani said, Get lost, O enemy of Allah! You are not my Lord, because the commands of my Lord are not cancelled for anyone, or some similar words.
As for whether Imaam Ahmad saw his Lord, I do not know if this is true or not. It is said that he saw his Lord but I do not know if this is true.

Please reply as soon as possible...",,,"Praise be to Allah.It was proven in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah likes the act of sneezing and dislikes the act of yawning, so if any one of you sneezes and praises Allah (says “al-hamdu Lillaah”), it is a duty on every Muslim who hears him to say to him, “Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you).” As for yawning, it is from the Shaytaan, so if any of you feels the urge to yawn, he should suppress it as much as he can, for when any one of you yawns, the Shaytaan laughs at him.”
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 10/505)
It was also reported from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If any one of you sneezes, let him say ‘Al-hamdu Lillaah,’ and let his brother or his companion say, ‘Yarhamuk Allah.’ And if he says to him, ‘Yarhamuk Allah,’ let him say, ‘Yahdeekum Allahu wa yusliha baalakum (May Allah guide you and correct your thinking).’”
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 10/502)
Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that two men sneezed in the presence of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who said “Yarhamuk Allah” to one of them, but not to the other. The one to whom he did not say it said: “So and so sneezed, and you said ‘Yarhamuk Allah’ to him; I sneezed but you did not say it to me.” He said, “He praised Allah (said ‘al-hamdu Lillaah’) and you did not.”
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 10/504)
Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When one of you sneezes and praises Allah, then say ‘Yarhamuk Allah’ to him, but if he does not praise Allah then do not say it.”
(Reported by Muslim 2992)
Sneezing brings a person the blessing of relief by releasing vapours that were trapped in the head which, if they were to remain there, would cause him pain and sickness. For this reason, Islam tells him to praise Allah for this blessing and for the fact that his body is still intact after this jolt that shook him like an earthquake… for sneezing causes a disturbing movement in the body… It was said (concerning the origin of the word “tashmeet” [which is translated here as “saying ‘yarhamuk Allah’, but the original meaning is to tell someone to rejoice at another’s ‘misfortune’]): this is telling him to feel joyful because he has annoyed the Shaytaan by praising Allah for the blessing of sneezing and its association with things that Allah likes. When a person mentions Allah and praises Him, this annoys the Shaytaan in several ways, for example: the act of sneezing itself, which Allah likes; his praising Allah for it; the Muslims praying for mercy for him; and his prayer for them to be guided. All of this annoys the Shaytaan and makes him upset, so the believer is told to rejoice over this annoyance of his enemy. Praying for mercy for the one who sneezes is called tashmeet because it implies that he should rejoice over the annoyance of his enemy. This is a good meaning which people should bear in mind when they sneeze or say ‘yarhamuk Allah’ to one who sneezes, and they should appreciate the blessing of sneezing for the body and mind, and understand why Allah likes it. Praise be to Allah as is His due for He is the Most Generous and Majestic.
The scholar Ibn Muflih al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) reported that Imaam Ibn Hubayrah said: “Al-Raazi reported from some doctors: sneezing is not a sign of the onset of sickness, unless it is accompanied by catarrh.” Ibn Hubayrah said: “If a person sneezes, this is an indication of good health, sound digestion and physical strength, so he should praise Allah. This is why the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us to praise Allah.”
It is also important to know that the Muslim should submit to the texts and act in accordance with them, without trying too hard to understand precisely why a text commands or forbids something. He should believe that Allah is the Wise and Aware, Who does not prescribe anything for His slaves unless it is in their best interests, in this world and the next, even though it may not cross their minds and some people may understand part of the wisdom behind it whilst others will never know. The Muslim’s basic rule is to follow the commands, and if he has some knowledge of the reason behind the commands, then praise be to Allah.
And Allah knows best.
For further details on the rules concerning sneezing, see: Al-Aadaab al-Shara’iyyah by Ibn Muflih, 2/334; Zaad al-Ma’aad by Ibn al-Qayyim, 2/438; Ghadhaa’ al-Albaab by al-Safaareeni, 1/441",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

    permissible to give charity to a kaafir. The reason for the difference of opinion is that
    charity means giving something in the hope of earning reward, so will a person be rewarded
    for spending on a kaafir? The Hanbalis said  and it is the well known view of the
    Shaafais and was also reported from Muhammad in al-Siyar al-Kabeer 
    that it is permissible to give charity to kaafirs in general. This is because of the
    general applicability of the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): And they give
    food, in spite of their love for it (or: for the love of Him) to the poor, the orphan and
    the captive [al-Insaan 76:8]. Ibn Qudaamah said: At that time, captives
    could only have been kaafirs. The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be
    upon him) said: In (the kind treatment of) every living being there is a
    reward. Asma bint Abi Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said:
    My mother came to visit me and she was a mushrik at the time of the Messenger of
    Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). I asked the Messenger of Allaah
    SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), My mother has come to visit me,
    and she does not want to become Muslim. Should I uphold the ties of kinship with my
    mother? He said, Yes, uphold the ties of kinship with your mother.
    Because upholding the ties of kinship is praiseworthy in all religions, and giving to
    others is a noble characteristic. Al-Mawsooah al-Fiqhiyyah, part 26.
    If a non-Muslim person is asking, it is either of the
    following cases:
He has an urgent need, such as food, and if he does not receive food he
        will die. In this case you should feed him, unless he is openly hostile towards Islam, in
        which case you should refrain. In cases like this, what is given to him should be charity
        (sadaqah), not zakaah.

His need is not urgent as in the first case, but something may be given
        to a person like this for the purpose of opening his heart and calling him to Islam,
        because this serves the overall purpose of shareeah.

Given that currently the price of silver is lower than the price of gold, the nisab should be based on the price of silver, so if a person’s wealth (in paper money) reaches the nisab on that basis, he has to pay zakah.
The nisab for silver is roughly equivalent to 595 grams of silver, so the one who has wealth has to pay 2.5% or 25 out of every 1,000 that he has in currency, after one year has passed).

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Forbidden to you (for marriage) are:
    your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your fathers sisters, your mothers
