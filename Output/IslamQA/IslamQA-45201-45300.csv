45207,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45207,Can we strive in worship as the early generations did?,"The righteous people of earlier generations are famous for their love of worship and striving hard in performing it, such as qiyaam al-layl (spending the night in prayer and worship), and reading and memorizing Qur’aan. Can we in this day and age do even a little of that, with all the fitnah (temptation and tribulation) that surrounds us on all sides?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Any one of us can strive in worship and compete with those 
      men in doing the acts of worship enjoined in sharee’ah and encouraged by 
      the teachings of Islam. The Muslim should have strong will and ambition 
      that could even turn mountains to dust, as it was said, The ambition and 
      will power of a man can move mountains.  

    The Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) are the best 
    example to this ummah of obedience and worship, but that did not prevent 
    those who came after them from being motivated to compete with them in the 
    field of worship, so that they will not be the only ones who are close to 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Listen to one 
    of them and you will be amazed at his great ambition and will power. Abu 
    Muslim al-Khawlaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Did the companions 
    of Muhammad think that they would be the only ones who will be close to him? 
    No, by Allaah, we will crowd around him with them so that they will know 
    that there were men (of ambition and will power) who succeeded them! 

    He used to say this whenever he spent the night in prayer and 
    worship (qiyaam al-layl). If his feet grew tired he would strike them with 
    his hand and say that. With such determination the Muslim can perform acts 
    of worship and obedience. This is the kind of praiseworthy competition that 
    is encouraged in the verse where Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “and for this let (all) those strive who want to strive”

    [al-Mutaffifeen 83:26]

    If it were not possible for the later generations (those who 
    came after the Sahaabah, until today) to strive to do great acts of 
    obedience and worship, we would not see Allaah urging all His slaves to do 
    that, and promising them a great reward if they do it, and the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would not have given this 
    important advice when he said: “Make the most of five things before five 
    (other things happen): your life before you die, your good health before you 
    become sick; your free time before you become busy; your youth before you 
    grow old; and your wealth before you become poor.” Classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) in Saheeh wa Da’eef al-Jaami’ 
    al-Sagheer. This is a call to us to make the most of our lives by 
    worshipping Allaah before death catches us unawares; to make the most of our 
    good health before we become incapable and sick, for a healthy person can do 
    things that a sick person cannot; to make the most of our free time before 
    we get busy with spouses, children and work; to make the most of our youth 
    with its energy and ambition and will power before we grow old and weak; and 
    to make the most of our wealth by giving in charity and spending before that 
    is taken away and we are no longer able to do it. 

    There are many shining examples among contemporary Muslims 
    whose lives are filled with obedience and worship. No age of Muslim history 
    has been devoid of such examples – praise be to Allaah – who have great 
    ambition that motivates them to say and do all that Allaah loves and that 
    pleases Him. Among this ummah nowadays there are those who have spent their 
    lives in jihad and sacrificed themselves for the sake of Allaah, thus 
    earning Paradise. There are those who have striven in pursuit of knowledge 
    from the moment they developed discernment until they died. There are those 
    who regularly prayed qiyaam al-layl and never stopped, whether they were 
    travelling or were at home. There are those who have spent all their wealth 
    for the sake of Allaah even though zakaah was never required of them. There 
    are those who have devoted themselves to the Muslims, interceding for some 
    and meeting the needs of others, giving answer to people’s questions, 
    issuing fatwas, teaching the ignorant and urging the people to do good. 

    You will never lack any brilliant example in the lives of our 
    scholars, imams and mujaahideen. You will see in their lives that which will 
    encourage you to do acts of worship and will make you realize that there is 
    still room for us to compete with those who went before us. If you look at 
    the lives of just three imams – ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, al-Albaani and Ibn 
    ‘Uthaymeen – you will see how they learned, taught, strove hard, gave and 
    spent, interceded for others and called people to Islam. And the Muslims are 
    still producing great examples in their jihad against the kuffaar throughout 
    the world. 

    There are many good examples of people who memorize the 
    Qur’aan. Many people memorized the entire Qur’aan before reaching the age of 
    eight, and there are some who have memorized the entire Book in two months, 
    or even in one month. 

    The Muslim who wants to do acts of worship and obedience and 
    compete with those who came before him and with his contemporaries of those 
    who have ambition and will power has to beware of a few things: 

    1 – Beware of being negligent about the Hereafter and its 
    great rewards. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in 
    Badaa’i’ al-Fawaa’id (p. 98): Hearts are ruined because of complacency 
    and negligence, but they are made sound with fear and remembrance of 
    Allaah. 

    2 – Stop competing in worldly matters with the people of this 
    world; leave it for them and concern yourself with higher matters. Beware of 
    making this world the main focus of your concern. You should have money and 
    property in your hand, not in your heart. 

    3 – Stop procrastinating. You should hasten to do good deeds 
    in response to Allaah’s command (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And march forth in the way (which leads to) forgiveness 
    from your Lord, and for Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth, 
    prepared for Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:133] 
“Race with one another in 
    hastening towards forgiveness from your Lord (Allaah), and Paradise the 
    width whereof is as the width of the heaven and the earth”
[al-Hadeed 57:21]

45268,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45268,How to offer the daytime four-rak’ah prayers,"My question is about the naafil prayer that is offered before Zuhr and before ‘Asr: is it done with four rak’ahs and one tasleem, or should the tasleem be said after each two rak’ahs?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The majority of scholars are of the view that it is better to 
    offer the naafil prayers of both day and night two by two. Some scholars – 
    such as Imam Ahmad – were of the view that it is obligatory to do it this 
    way, and that these prayers are not valid if more than two rak’ahs are done 
    with one tasleem, except for Witr, because of the reports to that effect in 
    the saheeh Sunnah. 

    They quoted as evidence for that the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar 
    (may Allaah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The prayers of the day and night 
    are to be offered two by two.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 597; Abu Dawood, 
    1295; al-Nasaa’i, 1666; Ibn Maajah, 1322. This hadeeth was classed as saheeh 
    by Shaykh al-Albaani in Tamaam al-Mannah, p. 240. 
 What is meant by “two 
    by two” is two rak’ahs by two rak’ahs. This is how it was explained by Ibn 
    ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him). 

    In Saheeh Muslim it is narrated that ‘Uqbah ibn 
    Hurayth said: I said to Ibn ‘Umar: “What does two by two mean?” He said: 
    “Saying the tasleem after each two rak’ahs.” 

    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen said: 

    The words two by two mean that you should not pray all four 
    rak’ahs together, rather you should pray them two by two, because it is 
    proven in Saheeh al-Bukhaari and Saheeh Muslim from Ibn ‘Umar 
    that a man asked the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him): “What do you think about the night prayers?” He said: “Two by 
    two, then if any one of you fears that dawn will come, let him pray one 
    rak’ah and that will make what he has prayed odd-numbered for him.” 

    With regard to the word al-nahaar (day), this was 
    narrated by the authors of al-Sunan, and the scholars differed to 
    whether it is saheeh or not. 

    The correct view is that it is proven, as it was deemed to be 
    saheeh by al-Bukhaari.  

    Based on this, the nighttime prayers and the daytime prayers 
    should both be offered two by two, saying the tasleem after each two 
    rak’ahs. Every hadeeth which mentions four rak’ahs without clearly stating 
    that the tasleem should not be said should be interpreted in this manner, 
    i.e., it should be understood as meaning that the tasleem should be said 
    after each two rak'ahs, because this is the principle, and minor issues are 
    to be understood in the light of the basic principles.  

    ‘Aa’ishah said that when she was asked about how the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed in Ramadaan, she 
    said: “In Ramadaan and at other times he did not pray more than eleven 
    rak’ahs. He would pray four, and do not ask how beautiful and how long they 
    were.” This would appear to mean four rak’ahs with one salaam, but it should 
    be interpreted according to the general principle, which is that the 
    nighttime prayers are offered two by two, as that was proven from the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).  It 
    may also be said that she mentioned four on their own, then four on their 
    own, because he would pray four and then rest, as is indicated by the word 
    thumma (then) which is indicative of the sequence of events and also 
    suggests a slight pause between the events described. 

    Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/76, 77 

    In his Saheeh (2/214), Ibn Khuzaymah included the 
    hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar in a chapter which he called Baab al-Tasleem fi 
    kulli Rak’atayn min Salaat al-Tatawwu’ Salaat al-Layli wa’l-Nahaari jamee’an 
    (Saying the tasleem following each two rak'ahs of voluntary prayer during 
    both the night and the day). He followed this with a chapter entitled 
    Baab Dhikr al-Akhbaar al-Mansoosah wa’l-Daallah ‘ala Khilaaf Qawli man 
    za’ama anna tatawwu’ al-Nahaar arba’an la mathna (Reports which indicate 
    the opposite of the view of those who claim that the voluntary daytime 
    prayers are to be offered four by four not two by two), in which he quoted a 
    great deal of evidence to show that the voluntary daytime prayers are to be 
    offered two by two. 

    The hadeeth, “May Allaah have mercy on those who pray four 
    (rak’ahs) before ‘Asr” is to be understood in the manner explained above, 
    which is that they are to be offered two by two. 

    Ibn Hibbaan said: 

    When the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said “Four”, he meant with two tasleems, because in the report of Ya’la 
    ibn ‘Ata’ from ‘Ali ibn ‘Abd-Allaah al-Azdi from ‘Ibn ‘Umar, it says that 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The 
    prayers of the night and the day are (to be offered) two by two.” 

    Saheeh Ibn Hibbaan, 6/606. He 
    also said something similar – in 6/631 – regarding the four rak’ahs which 
    are to be offered after Jumu’ah prayer. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    What is prescribed is for the Muslim to offer the naafil 
    prayers of the day and the night two by two, because the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The night prayers are (to be 
    offered) two by two” (saheeh – agreed upon). And according to a saheeh 
    report he said: “The prayers of the night and the day are (to be offered) 
    two by two.” Narrated by Imam Ahmad and the authors of al-Sunan with 
    a saheeh isnaad.

45271,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45271,Is it permissible to rent a café that offers “hubble-bubble pipes” in order to sell food?,There is a cafeteria in one of the casinos. Is it permissible for me to rent it in order to sell food? Please note that the cafeteria only offers tea and hubble-bubble pipes – what is the ruling on that?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It seems that it is not permissible for you to rent this 
    place to serve food and drink, because smoking the hubble-bubble pipe is 
    haraam, as it is a waste of money and causes the Muslim to harm himself and 
    others who smell this foul smoke. See question no.
    10922 and
    7432. 

    The basic principle is that the Muslim should avoid these 
    places of sin and keep away from them, and he should not offer them any help 
    or serve things that will make people stay there longer such as permissible 
    food and drinks. Renting part of the casino in order to serve food to these 
    sinners goes against the command to the Muslims to change evil wherever he 
    sees it, and it goes against the command to avoid places of evil and sin. 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And it has already been revealed to you in the Book (this 
    Qur’aan) that when you hear the Verses of Allaah being denied and mocked at, 
    then sit not with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if 
    you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:140]

    al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    The words of Allaah, “then sit not with them, until they 
    engage in a talk other than that”, mean: something other than kufr.  

    “(but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you 
    would be like them” – this indicates that it is obligatory to avoid 
    sinners if they are openly committing evil, because whoever does not avoid 
    them is effectively approving of their actions. 

    Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 5/418 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Denouncing evil in one's 
    heart is obligatory for everyone. This means hating and despising the evil 
    action, and keeping away from those who do it if one is unable to change it 
    with one’s hand (by taking action) or with one's tongue (by speaking out 
    against it).

    Indeed, the owner should not rent out his stores to those who 
    will use them for sinful purposes. 

    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez Aal al-Shaykh was asked: 

    My father bequeathed to me one-third of the rent of a 
    building that he owned. This building is rented out to stores, some of which 
    sell cigarettes and hubble-bubble pipes, and there is also a store that 
    sells music tapes. Is this bequest permissible or not? Please note that we 
    do not own anything else. May Allaah reward you with good. 

    He replied: 

    What you have to do is to evict these people, because selling 
    cigarettes and hubble-bubbles and music tapes are all things that go against 
    sharee’ah, and it is not permissible for the Muslim to help others in sin 
    and transgression. Allaah will compensate you with something better, in sha 
    Allaah, and you will be able to rent it and earn from it in such a way that 
    will benefit you and benefit the deceased, in sha Allaah. 

    Note that whoever gives up something for the sake of Allaah, 
    Allaah will compensate him with something better than it, and that provision 
    cannot be acquired by sinful means. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He 
    will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).

    3. And He will provide him from (sources) he never could 
    imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. 
    Verily, Allaah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allaah has set a measure 
    for all things”

I helped him in fact, but some of that did not happen, praise be to Allaah. I even helped him to do witchcraft against one young man, but it did not harm him, praise be to Allaah.

 I have repented now, and I keep away from that deviant young man and keep company with good people. I have also started to memorize the Holy Qur’aan.

 My question is: is it one of the conditions of my repentance that I should tell him about the witchcraft I did, in order for my repentance to be accepted?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    We praise Allaah for guiding you to repent, and to keep away 
    from these bad friends. You have to keep on thanking Allaah and asking Him 
    to make you steadfast and to guide you. 

    The rights of other people must be restored if the wrong done 
    involved material things. With regard to intangible things, such as gossip, 
    the correct view – and Allaah knows best – is that he does not have to tell 
    him if the person does not know about that, so it is sufficient to pray for 
    forgiveness for his sin, and to pray for forgiveness for his brother too, in 
    return for the harm done by his gossiping and backbiting about him. 

    The harm done to this young man by means of plotting and 
    witchcraft comes under the heading of intangible matters, so you do not have 
    to tell him about what you did; it is sufficient for you to fulfil the 
    conditions of sincere repentance, namely regretting what you did, giving it 
    up, and resolving not to go back to it again, as well as stopping the 
    evildoer and others as much as you can.

    But if that young man or anyone else knows about the plots 
    and tricks you used against him, then you have to apologize to him and ask 
    for his forgiveness, because you are only allowed not to tell him if he did 
    not know so that he will not be upset by that, and lest that lead to cutting 
    off ties and the stirring up of enmity and hatred between you. But if he 
    knows that you did this evil thing, then the reason not to tell him is no 
    longer applicable and your apologizing to him will serve a purpose.
