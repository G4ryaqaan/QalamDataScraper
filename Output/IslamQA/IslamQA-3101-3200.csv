magazines","What is the ruling on publishing magazines that carry pictures of women, ideas that go against Islam and interviews with female performers and women who are adorned with the adornment tabarruj of the
      modern jaahiliyyah ?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The mutawaatir reports of the Sunnah show that 
  making pictures or images is absolutely haraam and those who make pictures are 
  cursed. Every maker of pictures will be in Hell, and every picture or image 
  that he made will be given a soul and he will be punished by it in Hell. The 
  makers of pictures will be the most severely punished of people. The picture-maker 
  will be told to breathe life into the images he made; they will be punished 
  and will be told, “Give life to that which you have created!” The 
  prohibition is multiplied if these pictures cause temptation, such as pictures 
  of naked women, or pictures of men with women. If that is haraam, then how about 
  the magazines that promote this and call people to temptation, immorality, promiscuity 
  and the means of doing wrong? Anyone who publishes such magazines, or sells 
  them, gives them as a gift or buys them, partakes in the sin. The Prophet  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed wine and the one who sells 
  it, the one who buys it, the one who makes it, the one for whom it is made, 
  the one who drinks it, the one who serves it, the one who carries it, the one 
  to whom it is carried, and the one who profits from it. The same applies to 
  these magazines, whose bad effect on people’s morals, chastity and religion 
  is sometimes worse than that of alcohol, especially when they contain deviant 
  ideas and news of female performers and women who adorn themselves in the manner 
  of jaahiliyyah. Publishing these magazines, writing articles for them, importing 
  them and publicizing them means that one is taking part in this corruption, 
  spreading immorality and calling for promiscuity, social disintegration and 
  deviation from correct morals and modesty. Our advice to anyone who wants to 
  attain salvation is to keep away from these magazines and have nothing to do 
  with them in the slightest, in the hope of saving oneself and keeping one’s 
  religion and honour safe. And Allaah knows best.","Fataawa Islamiyyah, Ibn Jibreen, 385"

It is not permissible to work as an editor, writer or distributor for such magazines, because this involves co-operating in sin, spreading mischief throughout the land, calling for the corruption of society and propagating promiscuity.

Verily Allah is Severe in punishment.” [al-Maa’idah 5:2]. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever calls to right guidance will have a reward equal to that of the one who follows it, without it detracting in the least from his reward; and whoever calls to misguidance will bear sin equal to that of the one who follows it, without it detracting in the least from his sin.” (Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh, 4831).
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “There are two types of the people of Hell whom I have not seen: people with whips like the tails of cattle, with which they beat the people, and women who are clothed yet naked, walking with an enticing gait and with their heads looking like the humps of camels leaning to one side. They will not enter Paradise or even smell its fragrance, although its fragrance can be detected from such-and-such a distance.”

    is instilling in the person who does this and makes it appear that someone is present when
    this is not the case. There are three reasons for having reservations about this practice:
(1) It is lying; (2) it involves deceiving those who are in charge; (3)
    it makes the absent person entitled to wages on the basis of attendance, which he then
    takes and consumes unlawfully. One of these reservations alone is sufficient to make this
    practice, which the questioner apparently sees as a human service or favour, be described
    as haraam. Not all human favours are praiseworthy; only those that coincide with
    sharee’ah are praiseworthy – those that go against sharee’ah are to be
    condemned. Calling favours that go against sharee’ah “human services” is in
    fact a misnomer, because anything that goes against sharee’ah is a bestial action.
    This is why Allaah described the kuffaar and mushrikeen as being like cattle. He says
    (interpretation of the meaning): “… while those who disbelieve enjoy
    themselves and eat as cattle eat, and the Fire will be their abode.” [Muhammad 47:12]
    and “…They are only like cattle; - nay, they are even farther astray from the
    Path…” [al-Furqaan 25:44]. So everything that is contrary to sharee’ah

3119,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3119,How to Calculate Mahr in Islam,"What is the minimum amount of mahr (Dowry) permitted by Shari’ah? I found in one book, the dowry of most of the wives and daughters of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was 480 Dirhams. What is the equivalent amount for the present time?","It is permissible for the mahr to be a little or a lot of whatever is considered to be wealth, if both partners agree. For more, please see the detailed answer.","Minimum amount of mahr in Islam


Mahr of the Mothers of the Believers","Praise be to Allah.Minimum amount of mahr in Islam
The minimum amount of mahr has been explained in the report in al-Sahih (no. 1425) narrated from Sahl ibn Sa’d al-Sa’idi, who said: “A woman came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, I have come to give myself (in marriage) to you.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) looked at her and looked her up and down, then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) lowered his head and paused. When the woman saw that he had not made a decision about her, she sat down. A man from among the Sahabah said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, if you are not interested in her, then marry her to me.’ He said, ‘Do you have anything?’ He said, ‘No, by Allah, O Messenger of Allah.’ He said, ‘Go to your people and see if you can find anything.’ So the man went, then he came back and said, ‘No, by Allah, I could not find anything.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘Look and see (if you can find anything), even if it is only an iron ring which you can give.’ So he went, then came back, and said,  ‘No, by Allah, O Messenger of Allah, not even an iron ring. But (I have) this izar (garment) of mine, she can have half of it.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘What can she do with your izar? If you are wearing it she will have nothing of it.’ The man sat down, then after a long time had passed, he got up (to leave). The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw him leaving and called him. When he came, he said, ‘What do you know of the Quran ?’ He said, ‘Soorah Such-and-Such and Soorah Such-and-Such.’ He said, ‘Do you know them by heart?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘Then go, you are married to her by what you know of the Quran.’” 
This hadith shows that it is permissible for the mahr to be a little or a lot of whatever is considered to be wealth, if both partners agree, because an iron ring is extremely little. This is the madhhab of al-Shafi’i and is also the view of the majority of scholars among the earlier and later generations. 
This was also the view of Rabi’ah, Abu’l-Zinad, Ibn Abi Dhib, Yahya ibn Sa’id, al-Layth ibn Sa’d, al-Thawri, al-Awza’i, Muslim ibn Khalid, Ibn Abi Layla, Dawud, the fuqaha of the scholars of hadith and Ibn Wahb among the companions of Malik. It was also the view of all the scholars of the Hijaz, Basrah, Kufa and Syria, and others, that whatever the couple agree upon is permissible (as a dowry), whether it is a lot or a little, such as a whip, a pair of shoes or an iron ring, etc. 
Mahr of the Mothers of the Believers
With regard to the question about the mahr of the Mothers of the Believers: 
Muslim narrated in his Sahih (no. 1426) that Abu Salamah ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman said: “I asked ‘Aishah, the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), what the mahr given by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was. She said: ‘The mahr that he gave to his wives was twelve uqiyah and a nashsh.’ He said, Do you know what a nashsh is? He said, she said it is half of an uqiyah. That was five hundred dirhams. This was the mahr given by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to his wives.” 
Ibn Khaldun said: 
“The consensus of the scholars from the beginning of Islam and the time of the Sahabah and the Taabi’in has been that the shar’i dirham is that of which ten coins weigh seven mithqals of gold. The uqiyah is forty dirhams of this type, and on this basis it is seven-tenths of a dinar… All of these amounts are agreed upon by scholarly consensus (ijma’).” (Al-Muqaddimah, p. 263) 
Based on this, the weight of a dirham in grams is 2.975 grams. 
So the mahr of the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was 500 x 2.975 = 1487.5 grams of silver. 
The price of one gram of pure silver that has not been worked is approximately 1 riyal, so the mahr in riyals is approximately 1487.5 riyals. In dollars it is approximately $396.70 (this varies depending on the present price of silver).

    who has become Muslim, but she has two children and their father is Hindu","I have read question 2803 in which you
      advised our sister to announce her marraige as it is sunnah and I have also read the other
      questions with regards to parents rejecting their son's/daughter's choice of marraige
      because of various reasons. What advice do you give to a person in the following
      situation: She is divorced frmo her ex husband and has embraced Islam for she has
      reliaed the truth and she was guided to the right path, Al Hamdulilah, her conversion is
      kept secret from her family for obvious reasons and her two children whom she has custody
      of are still Hindu because her ex husband would rather kill her than see his children
      embrace Islam. He is strong enemy of Islam and has sworn our deen and ALLAH on a few
      occassions. She is now in love with a religious and well mannered Muslim man who has asked
      her to marry him. The problem is that his parents object to their marraige because the
      mother feels that the lady in question is a convert and that converts don't make good
      muslims. In fact her exact words were ""Thery will never be one of us"" If they do
      decide to make Nikaah can they for these reasons keep their marraige a secret. The man who
      has asked for her hand in marraige says that he will accept her children provided they
      embrace Islam because two religions cannot be practiced in one house especially when the
      other one is idol worshipp and I can't agree with him more. How do these two people who
      love each other make a life of their own. 
      His parents are a problem on the one hand and the ex husband not wanting the children to
      embrace Islam is another problem.
      My friend does not want to give up custody of her children because her ex husband is
      abusive. Please advise our sister as soon as possible as she is suffering from depression
      and sleepless nights. 
      May ALLAH bless our Prophet Muhammad.
      Jazak Allah",,,"Praise be to Allah.First of all, we would like to congratulate our sister for embracing
        Islam, which is the joy for which wealth and souls would be sacrificed, for all the
        blessing of Islam makes all grief and distress fade into insignificance.
The sister says that she loves a Muslim man. We say: it is not
        appropriate for a Muslim woman to fall into the trap of nonsensical emotions and forbidden
        relationships into which others fall. The love which people hear about and read about is
        one of the dazzling tricks of the Shaytaan, and it usually happens with regard to things
        that Allaah has forbidden. If a man finds that he likes a girl, the only option he has is
        to ask her guardian (walee) for permission to marry her.
The mans mothers comment that new Muslims cannot be good
        Muslims is false. Were the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) anything but new
        Muslims, given that prior to their Islam they had been believers in Shirk? Does any
        Muslim have any doubts about their commitment to religion and their character? Moreover,
        we see that many new Muslims are many times better than many (born) Muslims! Just because
        a Muslim is new does not mean that he will never be good, and just because a Muslim is
        born in Islam does not mean that he is good. What counts is Taqwa (piety, awareness of
        Allaah) and righteous deeds, as well as the length of time one has been in Islam and has
        been worshipping Allaah.
There is no reason why knowledge of the man's marriage should not be
        withheld from his parents, especially since this is in the interests of the sister and
        there are so few people who can help her to overcome her difficulties. It is the woman who
        needs a walee according to shareeah, not the man. However, we would prefer that he
        wins his familys approval by convincing them, because this is in their best
        interests, benefits which may be lost if they find out that their son concealed his
        marriage from them.
The fact that the husband says he wants to call the children to Islam is
        good. We ask Allaah to help him to achieve this. The fact that the Hindu father is evil is
        sufficient reason for him not to make an open display of his calling the children to
        Islam, if that could lead to this kaafir taking the children away by going to the kaafir
        courts. You have to act with wisdom in this case.
The woman who is asking this question should not arrange her own
        marriage even if she has been previously married, because shareeah does not permit
        this. If she does not have a walee as required by shareeah, then her walee may be
        the qaadi (judge) or whoever is in charge of the Muslim affairs in her country, such as
        the head of the Islamic centre or his deputy.
They  especially the sister  have to seek the help of Allaah
        in dealing with these problems which are giving her sleepless nights. Everyone should know
        that whoever puts his trust in Allaah, Allaah will show him a way out. She has to make
        duaa sincerely, and he has to try as hard as he can to advise his family and
        change their views about new Muslims by showing them real examples of people who are the
        opposite of what they think. With regard to the tragedy caused by the former husband, we
        advise her again not to make an open display of her calling the children to Islam, lest
        that should cause the father to do something that will have bad consequences. If they feel
        suspicious about his intentions, there is no harm in calling the police to do whatever is
        necessary with regard to him.
If getting married means that the sister will lose her right to custody
        of her children, we advise her not to get married now, for fear that these two souls may
        end up in Hell in the Hereafter  unless she fears that she herself may commit some
        immoral action, in which case she should marry the Muslim man whom she has told us about,
        with witnesses and a walee as we have stated above. Publicizing the marriage is sunnah,
        although it does not have to be announced officially and in writing. But this sister has
        to live in a protective Muslim environment and those people will have to know about her
        marriage lest she bring upon herself gossip about her honour. If it will be better for her
        to leave the place where her ex-husband lives and move to another place where she can be
        free, have custody of her children and be able to marry a believing Muslim man who will
        protect her and her children, then she should do that.
She has to make duaa and turn to Allaah to relieve her
        distress and grief. We pray that Allaah will give her the strength to do that which He
        loves and which pleases Him.

3143,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3143,Why does Islam Continue to be Successful in the Developed World?,Why has Islam continued to be so successful in the modern world?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Islam continues to be successful in the developed world, and elsewhere, because its call is in accordance with the fitrah or natural inclinations of mankind, and it advocates the best of human values, such as tolerance, love, mercy, truthfulness and sincerity.
Islam educates people and lifts them up to righteous conduct, good manners and virtue. Its call is distinguished from others by its realism, balance and moderation. Islam pays due attention to both the soul and the body. It neither suppresses physical desires nor allows extravagance in this regard; it makes a distinction between the natural inclination to enjoy the pleasures of this world and forbidden desires that come under the heading of depravity and perversion.
People embrace Islam because they find security, comfort and peace in it, they see a cure for their problems in it, and through it they are able to get rid of their feelings of confusion, anxiety and loss.
Islam is the religion of the fitrah, the natural inclination or pattern on which Allah has created mankind. For this reason, people of sound minds and upright inclinations embrace Islam, as Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘There is no child who is not born in a state of fitrah (i.e., Islam), then his parents make him into a Jew, a Christian or a Magian (Zoroastrian), just as animals produce whole animals (i.e., the animals are born perfect with no part of their bodies missing). Do you find any born with their ears cut off?’” Then Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “ ‘… Allah’s handiwork according to the pattern on which He has made mankind: no change (let there be) in the work (wrought) by Allah: that is the Standard Religion…’ [al-Room 30:30 – interpretation of the meaning – Yusuf Ali’s translation].”
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 1359). What is meant is that Allah has created mankind with the potential to learn the truth, accept Tawheed (pure monotheism) and submit to Allah. Their natural inclination is to learn Islam and love it, but a bad education, a disbelieving environment, their own whims and desires and the devils among jinn and mankind turn them away from the truth. Mankind is basically inclined towards Tawheed (pure monotheism), as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) reported that his Lord (Allah) said: “I created all my slaves as ‘hunafa’ (pure monetheists), but the devils turned them away from their religion.” (Reported by Muslim). For this reason the one who becomes a Muslim after having been a disbeliever is described as having “reverted” to Islam, as this is more correct than saying that he “converted.” When Islam enters a country where there is no nationalism or great legacy of jaahiliyah (ignorance), it spreads quickly because of its strength and the small number of obstacles. You may also see that Islam is suitable for all people, educated and uneducated, male and female, old and young; everyone finds in it what he wants and needs. Those who become Muslim in developed countries realize what their country’s civilization and laws, which have been fabricated from men’s whims and desires, have done to them, and they realize the extent of the misery in which people in developed countries are living. They see how prevalent psychological illnesses, nervous breakdowns, insanity and suicides are, despite the technological advances and great number of discoveries and inventions and modern systems of management. This is because all of that is concerned only with the physical and the outward, but it neglects the inward and fails to nourish and nurture the heart and soul. Allah says of these people (interpretation of the meaning): “They know only the outside appearance of the life of the world, and they are heedless of the Hereafter.” [al-Room 30:7]
Islam will continue to succeed, with the permission of Allah, so long as those who work for its sake are sincere and its followers adhere to it and believe in it, and apply its laws.
The fact that there are those who are not committed or who fall short will not prevent Islam from succeeding, with the permission of Allah, and nothing can distort its beauty. Its light will not falter because some people abandon it or fail to adhere to it.

Do the other wives have to be fully covered in hijab when this boy is present.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The boy mentioned is young, and women do not need to cover their faces when he is present. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And say to the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at illegal things) and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts, etc.), and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent (like palms or hands or one eye or both eyes for necessity to see the way, our outer dress like veil, gloves, head-cover, apron, etc.), and to draw their veils all over juyoobihinna (i.e., their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms, etc.), and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands fathers, their sons, their husbands sons, their brothers or their brothers sons, or their sisters sons, or their (Muslim) women (i.e., their sisters in Islam), or the (female) slaves whom their right hands possess, or old male servants who lack vigour, or small children who have no sense of the shame of sex. And let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment. And all of beg Allaah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful. [al-Noor 24:31]
This little boy is a small child who has no sense of the shame of sex, so it is permissible to uncover one's adornment in front of him. Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his Tafseer: The words (interpretation of the meaning), or small children who have no sense of the shame of sex refer to children who because of their young age do not understand anything about women or the temptation they may present, such as their soft voices or the way they walk. Because the child is so young, he does not understand anything about that, so there is nothing wrong with letting him enter upon women. But if a boy is approaching puberty and beginning to understand these things and to distinguish between who is beautiful and who is not, then he should not be allowed to enter upon women.

    sexual desires. In this country, at this age, it is very difficult not to get aroused
    several times a day. I hope you can understand. This causes stress while praying because a
    drop or two may come out and during the whole prayer I am worried about it. Also, it
    delays my performing the prayer. You said masturbation is not allowed. And you mentioned
    fasting. Due to my circumstances fasting voluntary fasts regularly is not feasible as it
    makes me too tired to study and concentrate. Also I am not able to marry now. This
    situation might continue for years if Allah grants me that long a life. Can I therefore
    castrate myself or take drugs that suppress sexual desires? I think the good that such a
    measure would do will outweigh the harm and make me steadfast in my prayer and
    concentration.But I wanted your advice before I take any steps .",,,"Praise be to Allah.Fasting is not only a remedy, it is also a purification of
    the soul and a means of earning reward and the pleasure of Allaah. It is also a striving
    against one’s desires. With a little patience and the hope of earning reward, one can
    get used to fasting. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was
    prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)”
    [al-Baqarah 2:183]
In the Tafseer of this aayah it was said that according to one opinion,
    the phrase “that you may become al-muttaqoon” means: that you may stay
    away from sin, because fasting is more of a deterrent and is more effective in keeping one
    from falling into sin. This is one of the meanings of the hadeeth, “Let him fast for
    that will be a protection for him.” Many people think that this is because fasting
    weakens the body and thus weakens desire. Even if that is the case, it is in addition to
    the fact that fasting motivates a person to keep away from anything that he fears may
    affect him adversely, either because of the blessing of the fast itself or because if the
    one who is fasting has to refrain from food and drink that are permissible, it is even
    more appropriate that he should keep away from things which are forbidden.

When young people who are unable to marry were commanded to fast, this is
    a sign of the wisdom and insight of the Lawgiver. It is clear that fasting has an effect
    in this regard and that it helps to control desire and reduce provocation.
With regard to your question about taking medication that can reduce
    desire, there is no reason why you cannot take some herbal extracts etc. to control your
    desires, so long as they are not harmful in any way. But this will not be of much help if
    you do not do some acts of worship to fill your time and other activities to use up your
    physical energy, such as Da’wah activities and helping those in need. Also reduce
    your intake of rich foods, do some sports activities, keep yourself busy with useful
    things, and make yourself a schedule that will use up your excess physical energy. Do not
    forget that it is also very important to keep away from sources of provocation. Be
    optimistic and do not think that you will remain in this situation for many years. May
    Allaah make it easy for you to marry soon. May He protect us and you from evil and guide
    us to the Straight Path.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

      She keeps goind back to her former religion, Hinduism, then seems to come back into the
      fold of Islam, then reverting back to Hinduism. I,being the eldest of all the children, do
      not understand how to handle this situation. From all the brothers & sisters, I am the
      only one who is still very close to her. Should the inevitable happen one day, how should
      I handle this situation.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It seems that your mother in is need of care and compassion, and at the
    same time she seems to be feeling some nostalgia for the past, by wishing to go back to
    her former corrupt religion. The former stems from her losing her position through the
    divorce which has taken place, so you and your brothers and sisters must make up for what
    she has lost to reduce the pain and bitterness of the humiliation she has suffered through
    this divorce. Most of the responsibility will fall on your shoulders because you are the
    closest of her children to her, as you say. You must enjoin your brothers and sisters to
    fulfil their duties of caring for her and looking after her, by speaking kindly to her,
    consoling her gently, serving her, taking care of her affairs, spending on her, visiting
    her, keeping in touch and upholding the ties of kinship, until things settle down for her
    and she feels better.
With regard to the second issue, her nostalgia for her former, corrupt
    religion, you must deal with this problem by advising her and making the effort to explain
    the seriousness of apostasy and returning to kufr. Tell her about the hadeeth of the
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “There are three things, if
    a person has them, he has found the sweetness of faith: if Allaah and His Messenger are
    more beloved to him than anyone or anything else; if he loves another and does not love
    him for any reason other than for the sake of Allaah; and if he would hate to return to
    kufr after Allaah has saved him from it as much as he would hate to be thrown into the
    fire.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. This version was narrated by
    Muslim in his Saheeh, no. 460).
    Alarm her with the aayah (interpretation of the
    meaning): “Verily, those who have turned their backs as disbelievers after the
    guidance has been manifested to them, Shaytaan has beautified for them (their false
    hopes), and (Allaah) prolonged their term (age).” [Muhammad 47:25]. Explain to
    her the fate of the apostate as described in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the
    meaning): “…And whosoever of you turns back from his religion and dies as a
    disbeliever, then his deeds will be lost in this life and in the Hereafter, and they will
    be the dwellers of the Fire. They will abide therein forever.” [al-Baqarah 2:217].
If you try your hardest, you will not be to blame if something that you
    dislike happens after that. But whatever the case, you must not carry out any last wishes
    or will to burn the body after death (cremation), because this is something that is viewed
    as abhorrent in Islamic sharee’ah (see Question #675). We ask Allaah for guidance and

With regard to du`a’s to do with repentance that you can recite every day and whilst at work, al-hamdulillah there are many such du`a’s, among the greatest of which are as follows:
“Rabbi’ghfir wa’rham wa anta khayru’l-raahimeen (My Lord! Forgive and show mercy, for You are the Best of those who show mercy!)” [al-Mu’minoon 23:118 – interpretation of the meaning].
“Rabbanaa ‘ghfar lanaa dhunoobanaa wa israafanaa fi amrinaa (Our Lord! Forgive us our sins and transgressions (in keeping our duties to You).” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:147 – interpretation of the meaning].
Shaddaad ibn Aws (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best prayer for seeking forgiveness is to say: ‘Allahumma anta rabbi la ilaaha illa anta, Khalaqtani wa ana ‘abduka wa ana ‘ala ‘ahdika wa wa’dika ma astata’t. A’oodhu bika min sharri ma sana’tu, aboo’u laka bi ni’matika ‘alayya wa aboo’u laka bi dhanbi, faghfir li fa innahu laa yaghfiru’l-dhunoob illaa anta (O Allah, You are my Lord. None has the right to be worshipped but You. You created me and I am Your slave, and I am faithful to my covenant and my promise (to You) as much as I can. I seek refuge with You from all the evil I have done. I acknowledge before You all the blessings You have bestowed upon me, and I confess to You all my sins. So I entreat You to forgive my sins, for nobody can forgive sins except You).” Whoever says this during the day, having faith in it and dies before the evening comes, will be among the people of Paradise, and whoever says it during the night, having faith in it, and dies before the morning comes, will be among the people of Paradise.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5831).
Abu Moosa reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite the following du`a’: “Allahumma’ghfir li khatee’ati wa jahli wa israafi fi amri wa maa anta a’lam bihi minni. Allahumma’ghfir li jiddi wa hazli wa khata’i wa ‘amdi wa kullu dhaalika ‘indi. Allahumma’ghfir li maa qaddamtu wa maa ajjartu wa ma asrartu wa maa a’lamtu wa maa anta a’lam bihi minni.

My ignorance and my transgression (in keeping my duty to You), and whatever You know about me better than I do. O Allah, forgive me for sins committed in earnest and in jest, by mistake and deliberately, and I have done all of that.

3189,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3189,"If the imam did not intend to lead the prayer, then people come and he leads them",Some people joining a person who is known to be praying fardh salat if they have the intention of making a jamaah. does it matter that the 'imam' had no intention to be in a congregation?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It is permissible for a person who is praying alone to intend 
    to lead the prayer, and act as imaam for those who join him in the prayer. 
    The evidence for that is the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari (667) and 
    Muslim (763) from Ibn ‘Abbaas who said: “I stayed one night with my maternal 
    aunt Maymoonah bint al-Haarith, and I said to her, ‘When the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gets up, wake me up 
    so that I can pray qiyaam al-layl.’ The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) got up, and I got up and stood beside him 
    on his left. He took my hand and made me stand on his right, and whenever I 
    closed my eyes he tweaked my ear, then he prayed eleven rak’ahs, then he 
    slept until I could hear the sound of his breathing. When Fajr came he 
    prayed two short rak’ahs. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 667; Muslim, 763). 

    The Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) started praying alone, then when Ibn ‘Abbaas joined him in prayer, he 
    led him in the prayer. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked this 
    question: 

    If I enter the mosque after the congregation (jamaa’ah) has 
    finished praying, and I say the iqaamah for the prayer and say “Allaahu 
    akbar” to start the prayer, then a man comes in after me and joins me in my 
    prayer, and I did not intend that, is his prayer valid or not? 

    He answered: 

    The correct view is that it is prescribed for you to form the 
    intention of leading the prayer when one or more persons join you in prayer, 
    because praying in congregation is something that is required and there is a 
    great deal of virtue in that. Some of the scholars are of the view that this 
    is valid in naafil prayers, but the correct view is that it is valid in both 
    naafil (supererogatory) and fard (obligatory) prayers, because the basic 
    principle is that the rulings on both are the same, except in cases where 
    there is specific evidence. It was proven that the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray on his own at night in the 
    house of Maymoonah, the maternal aunt of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased 
    with them all). Ibn ‘Abbaas got up, did wudoo’ and stood to the left of the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made him move to his right. 
    (Agreed upon) and led him in prayer. 

    Muslim narrated in his Saheeh that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was praying alone, and Jaabir 
    and Jabbaar came to him and stood to his right and his left. He made them 
    stand behind him and led them in prayer. These two hadeeth indicate what we 
    have mentioned. They also indicate that if there is only one other person, 
    he should stand to the right of the imam, and if there are two or more they 
    should stand behind him.
