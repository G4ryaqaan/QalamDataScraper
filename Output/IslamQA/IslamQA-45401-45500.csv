45435,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45435,Some lies of the Qaadiri tareeqah,"There is a qaseedah (ode) composed by Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qaadir al-Jilaani, the shaykh of the Qaadiri tareeqah. What is your opinion on this qaseedah?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qaadir al-Jilaani was one of the scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah. He was a follower of Sunnah, not an innovator, and he followed the path of the righteous Salaf and, in his writings, encouraged and enjoined following the Salaf. He told people to give up innovations in religion, and he clearly expressed his opposition to the scholars of ‘ilm al-kalaam among the Ash’aris and others. 
There are some errors in his writings, and some bid’ahs that may be insignificant compared to his great achievements. To learn more about these matters and the ways in which he was mistaken, please see the book  Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qaadir al-Jilaani wa Araa’uhu al-I’tiqaadiyyah wa’l-Sufiyyah by Shaykh Dr. Sa’eed ibn Masfar al-Qahtaani, 440-476. 
See also question no. 12932. 
Secondly:  
The followers of Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qaadir al-Jilaani have told many lies about him and attributed to him things that he did not say and would not have approved of, which go against the way he lived and his call to follow the Salaf and avoid innovations. 
Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] mentioned in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (27/127) some of these lies, when he said: 
“There is no doubt that Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qaadir al-Jilaani did not say this or enjoin it. Whoever says such things is telling lies about him.” 
One of these lies is the false attribution of this qaseedah to him, and we know for certain that Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qaadir is innocent of what it says in it. 
The Standing Committee was asked about this qaseedah, and they replied: 
This qaseedah indicates that its author is ignorant and makes claims for himself that are all kufr and misguidance. He claims that all the knowledge of the scholars is derived from his knowledge and are mere branches thereof; and that the conduct of the worshippers is in accordance with what he has enjoined for them and prescribed for them; and that he would be able to close Hell by his might, were it not for the prior covenant of the Messenger; and that he helps the mureeds (devotees) who are sincere towards him, and that he saves them from calamity and gives them life in this world and in the Hereafter, and protect them from all fears; and that he will be present with him on the Day of Resurrection when their deeds are weighed in the Balance. 
These false claims can only come from one who is ignorant and does not know his limitations, because complete knowledge belongs to Allaah alone and the affairs of the Hereafter and the control of all affairs belong to Allaah alone, not to any angel who is close to Him or to any Prophet who was sent, or to any righteous person. Allaah commanded His Messenger, who was the best of His creation, to recite to the ummah the following verses (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘I possess no power over benefit or hurt to myself except as Allaah wills. If I had the knowledge of the Ghayb (Unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe’”
[al-A’raaf 7:188] 
“Say: ‘It is not in my power to cause you harm, or to bring you to the Right Path.’
Say (O Muhammad): ‘None can protect me from Allaah’s punishment (if I were to disobey Him), nor can I find refuge except in Him’”
[al-Jinn 72:21-22]
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined the closest of people to him and their children to protect themselves from the punishment of Allaah by believing in Him and following His laws, and he told them that he could do nothing to help them before Allaah [on the Day of Resurrection].  He told them that Adam, Nooh, Ibraaheem, Moosa and ‘Eesa will all, on the Day of Resurrection, say, “Myself, myself,” so how can the Shaykh of the Qaadiri tareeqah or any other human being possess the means of saving his mureeds and protecting those who fulfil their covenant towards him and being with them when their deeds are weighed on the Day of Resurrection? How can he possess the power to close the doors of Hell by his might? This is an obvious lie and blatant disbelief in the laws of the Lord of the World. 
The author of this qaseedah goes even further in his exaggeration and transgression of the limits of common sense and sharee’ah, when he claims that he was exposed to the light of Muhammad before anything was created; and that he was with Jibreel and Muhammad (peace be upon them both) when they met together; and that he was with Nooh (peace be upon him) in the ark, and he witnessed the Flood; and that he was with Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) when he was thrown into the fire, and that this fire became cool because of his du’aa’; and that he was with Ismaa’eel, and the ram was only sent down because of his fatwa; and that he was with Ya’qoob (peace be upon him) when he lost his sight, and his eyes were only healed by his spitting on them;’; and he is the one who brought Idrees (peace be upon him) to Jannat al-Firdaws; and that he was with Moosa (peace be upon him) when he spoke to his Lord, and the staff of Moosa came from his staff; and that he was with ‘Eesa in the cradle; and that he is the one who gave Dawood the best voice in recitation. And he made even more outrageous claims that that, he claimed that he is Allaah in three lines of his qaseedah. The most blatant of his claims is when he says: 
“I am the One, the Only, the Great in and of himself… I am the one who is describing Him, the one who is described, I am the shaykh of the tareeqah.” 
Exalted be Allaah far above that. What kufr can there be after this? – Allaah forbid. 
It is evil enough for you to listen to this qaseedah. You do not need to know all the details of the history of the Qaadiryyah when you have heard the lies, kufr and falsehood in the qaseedah of the shaykh of this tareeqah. Strive to learn the truth from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the explanations given by the Sahaabah and those who followed them of the Qur’aan and the saheeh Sunnah. Please note that we believe that Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qaadir al-Jilaani, after whom this tareeqah is named, is innocent of this qaseedah just as the wolf was innocent of shedding the blood of son of Ya’qoob; his followers tell many lies about him and attribute to him things of which he is innocent. 
And Allaah is the Source of strength, 
May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and companions.

45456,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45456,Can You Offer Sujud As-Sahw in Sunnah Prayer?,Is it correct to do Sujud As-Sahw (prostration of forgetfulness) in a Mustahabb prayer such as a Nafl prayer?,It is prescribed to do Sujud As-Sahw in Nafl (supererogatory) prayers just as it is prescribed to do it in the obligatory prayers when there is a reason for doing it.,,"Praise be to Allah.It is prescribed to do Sujud As-Sahw in Nafl (supererogatory) prayers just as it is prescribed to do it in the obligatory prayers when there is a reason for doing it. 
This is the view of the majority of scholars ancient and modern, because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “If any one of you forgets [something in the prayer], let him do two prostrations.” (Narrated by Muslim, 402)
Also, correcting the prayer and annoying the devil are things which may be needed in the Nafl prayers just as in the obligatory prayers. 
Some scholars – including Ibn Sirin, Qutadah, ‘Ata’ and a number of the companions of Ash-Shafi’i scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) were of the view that there is no Sujud As-Sahw in voluntary (Nafl) prayers. But the correct view is that of the majority. 
Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book: “Bab As-Sahw fi’l-fard wa’l-tatawwu’ (Chapter on forgetfulness in obligatory and voluntary (prayers)). Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) did two prostrations after Witr, and Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Fath, commenting on the report of Ibn ‘Abbas: this was narrated by Ibn Abu Shaybah with an authentic Isnad (chain of narration). 
The point of quoting what Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) did, is that Witr is not obligatory, but Ibn ‘Abbas did Sujud As-Sahw in it, which indicates that Sujud As-Sahw should be done in both obligatory and Nafl prayers. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Sujud As-Sahw is two Sajdahs (prostrations), and should be done in both obligatory and Nafl (supererogatory) prayers if there is a reason for doing it.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 14/68) (See Kitab Sujud As-Sahw fi Daw’ Al-Kitab wa’s-Sunnah Al-Muttaharah by Shaykh ‘Abdullah At-Tayyar)
And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
45470,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45470,Refutation of the Church’s quoting the Qur’aan to prove that ‘Eesa is the “son of God”,"I read that the Church quotes some verses of the Qur’aan to prove that ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) is the “son of God.” Their evidence is that when Allaah was alone He said, “Verily, I am Allaah! Laa ilaaha illa Ana (none has the right to be worshipped but I)” [Ta-Ha 20:14 – interpretation of the meaning], in the singular; but when He created ‘Eesa the style used in some verses changed to the plural, as in the verses (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur’aan)” [al-Hijr 15:9] and “And certainly We! We it is Who give life, and cause death” [al-Hijr 15:23]. And they say, God is speaking in the plural, i.e., in the sense of “God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit”.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The variation in style in the Qur’aan, and the fact that 
    Allaah sometimes speaks of Himself in the singular and sometimes in a plural 
    form used by way of respect, does not prove that ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) 
    is the son of God, or that he is divine. This is for a number of reasons: 

    -1- 

    The variation in styles used in the Qur’aan, both singular 
    and plural, occurs with reference to events that took place thousands of 
    years before the creation of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) and his mother Maryam 
    (Mary), and when they were created and after that. Their existence has no 
    effect on the variation in styles, rather that is due to another reason 
    which may be explained as follows: 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And indeed, We created man from dried (sounding) clay of 
    altered mud.
 And the jinn, We created aforetime from the smokeless 
    flame of fire”

    [al-Hijr 15:26]

    “And (remember) when We said to the angels: ‘Prostrate 
    yourselves unto Adam.’ So they prostrated themselves except Iblees (Satan). 
    He was one of the jinn; he disobeyed the Command of his Lord. Will you then 
    take him (Iblees) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me 
    while they are enemies to you?”

    [al-Kahf 18:50]

    The style used (singular vs. plural) varied before ‘Eesa and 
    his mother (peace be upon them both) existed. Allaah said: 

    “Verily, We did send down the Tawraat (Torah) [to Moosa 
    (Moses)], therein was guidance and light, by which the Prophets, who 
    submitted themselves to Allaah’s Will, judged for the Jews. And the rabbis 
    and the priests [too judged for the Jews by the Tawraat (Torah) after those 
    Prophets], for to them was entrusted the protection of Allaah’s Book, and 
    they were witnesses thereto. Therefore fear not men but fear Me (O Jews) and 
    sell not My Verses for a miserable price. And whosoever does not judge by 
    what Allaah has revealed, such are the Kaafiroon (i.e. disbelievers — of a 
    lesser degree as they do not act on Allaah’s Laws).

    And We ordained therein for them: Life for life…

    And in their footsteps, We sent ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of 
    Maryam (Mary), confirming the Tawraat (Torah) that had come before him, and 
    We gave him the Injeel (Gospel)…

    And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad) the Book (this 
    Qur’aan) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and Muhaymin 
    (trustworthy in highness and a witness) over it (old Scriptures)”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:44-48]

    “Verily, We sent Nooh (Noah) to his people”

    [Nooh 71:1]

    And Allaah said concerning His Khaleel (Close Friend) 
    Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “So when he had turned away from them and from those whom 
    they worshipped besides Allaah, We gave him Ishaaq (Isaac) and Ya’qoob 
    (Jacob), and each one of them We made a Prophet.

    And We gave them of Our Mercy (a good provision in 
    plenty), and We granted them honour on the tongues (of all the nations, i.e. 
    everybody remembers them with a good praise)”

    [Maryam 19:49-50]

    And He said concerning Moosa (peace be upon him) 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “and made him draw near to Us for a talk with him [Moosa 
    (Moses)].

    And We granted him his brother Haaroon (Aaron), (also) a 
    Prophet, out of Our Mercy”

    [Maryam 19:52-53]

    And He said (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Verily, We have sent the Revelation to you (O Muhammad) 
    as We sent the Revelation to Nooh (Noah) and the Prophets after him…”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:163] 

    “And she who guarded her chastity [Virgin Maryam (Mary)], 
    We breathed into (the sleeves of) her (shirt or garment) [through Our Rooh — 
    Jibreel (Gabriel)], and We made her and her son [‘Eesa (Jesus)] a sign for 
    Al-‘Aalameen (the mankind and jinn)”

    [al-Anbiya’ 21:91] 

    “(Remember) when Allaah will say (on the Day of 
    Resurrection). O ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of 
    Maryam (Mary)! Remember My Favour to you and to your mother”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:110]

    And there are many other verses in which the style varies 
    between singular and plural, where the verses speak of the creation of 
    ‘Eesa, or Allaah’s words to him, and before he was created. From this it is 
    clear that the style did not change after the creation of ‘Eesa (peace be 
    upon him) as a sign that he is the “son of God” or that he is “divine”, 
    rather it is for another reason as we shall see below. 

    -2- 

    Everyone who knows the Arabic language and its styles will 
    know that the pronoun Ana (I) and the first person is used in the singular 
    when speaking of oneself. The first person plural Nahnu (we) is used to 
    refer to two or more. But it may be used by an individual of high standing 
    as a sign of his greatness, and the context and circumstances help the 
    reader or listener to understand what is meant. Whoever disagrees with that 
    is either ignorant and does not know what he is talking about or he is 
    stubborn and wants to twist the meaning of the words, following his whims 
    and desires. But Allaah will establish and make apparent the truth by His 
    Words, however much the sinners hate that [cf. Yoonus 10:82]. This will be 
    explained further below. 

    -3- 

     The Qur’aan is a Book the Verses whereof are perfected (in 
    every sphere of knowledge), and then explained in detail from One (Allaah), 
    Who is All-Wise Well-Acquainted (with all things) [cf. Hood 11:1] and 
    Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it, (it is) sent down 
    by the All‑Wise, Worthy of all praise 
    (Allaah) [cf. Fussilat 41:42]. Parts of it explain and confirm other 
    parts. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And they say: ‘The Most Gracious (Allaah) has begotten a son 
    (or offspring or children) [as the Jews say: ‘Uzayr (Ezra) is the son of 
    Allaah, and the Christians say that He has begotten a son [‘Eesa (Jesus)], 
    and the pagan Arabs say that He has begotten daughters (angels and 
    others)].’

    Indeed you have brought 
    forth (said) a terrible evil thing.

    Whereby the heavens are 
    almost torn, and the earth is split asunder, and the mountains fall in 
    ruins,

    That they ascribe a son 
    (or offspring or children) to the Most Gracious (Allaah).

    But it is not suitable 
    for (the Majesty of) the Most Gracious (Allaah) that He should beget a son 
    (or offspring or children).

    There is none in the 
    heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Gracious (Allaah) as a slave”

    [Maryam 19:88-93]

    “Say (O Muhammad): He 
    is Allaah, (the) One. 

    Allaah‑us‑Samad [Allaah 
    — the Self‑Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, (He neither eats nor 
    drinks)].

    He begets not, nor was 
    He begotten. 

    And there is none 
    co‑equal or comparable unto Him”

    [al-Ikhlaas 112:1-4] 

    “Verily, the likeness 
    of ‘Eesa (Jesus) before Allaah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from 
    dust, then (He) said to him: ‘Be!’ — and he was”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:59]

    So whoever believes in Him must study the verses of the 
    Qur’aan in the light of one another, not in isolation, the one who quotes 
    from Qur’aan should be fair in his quotation. He should not quote verses and 
    turn away from others, and he should not confuse truth with falsehood or use 
    some verses against others in order to promote falsehood, as our 
    predecessors the Jews did with the Torah, for which Allaah denounced them 
    when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Then do you believe in 
    a part of the Scripture and reject the rest? Then what is the recompense of 
    those who do so among you, except disgrace in the life of this world, and on 
    the Day of Resurrection they shall be consigned to the most grievous 
    torment. And Allaah is not unaware of what you do”

    [al-Baqarah 2:85] 

    Based on this, those who quote the Qur’aan as evidence should 
    accept its evidence that ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) is not the “son of God” 
    and that he is not divine along with God, and they should affirm the Oneness 
    of God, because of what is mentioned in its verses, and because Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Surely, they have 
    disbelieved who say: ‘Allaah is the Messiah [‘Eesa (Jesus)], son of Maryam 
    (Mary).’ But the Messiah [‘Eesa (Jesus)] said: ‘O Children of Israel! 
    Worship Allaah, my Lord and your Lord.’ Verily, whosoever sets up partners 
    (in worship) with Allaah, then Allaah has forbidden Paradise to him, and the 
    Fire will be his abode. And for the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers) 
    there are no helpers.

    Surely, disbelievers 
    are those who said: ‘Allaah is the third of the three (in a Trinity)’”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:17]

    And there are many similar verses in the Qur’aan. 

    Otherwise they should stop playing with the words, because 
    that will only lead them to shame and will make the wise laugh at them in 
    derision.","From Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 3/216-218"
45494,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45494,How to Catch up with a Rak`ah,"Suppose the congregation prayer has started in the mosque. I came a little late for the prayers. When the Imam goes for the Ruku` and we joined the Jama`ah, should we count that rak`ah as we have not recited Surat Al-Fatihah?","Whoever catches up with the imam when he is bowing, and bows with him, that is regarded as a rak`ah for him, according to the view of the majority of scholars, even if he did not recite al-Fatihah.",,"Praise be to Allah.Whoever catches up with the imam when he is bowing , and bows with him, that is regarded as a rak`ah for him, according to the view of the majority of scholars, even if he did not recite al-Fatihah. This is indicated by the report narrated by al-Bukhari (750) from Abu Bakrah, that he came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he was bowing and he bowed with him, before he reached the row. He mentioned that to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he said: “May Allah make you more keen but do not do it again.” 
It was narrated in a sahih report that Ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Whoever does not catch up with the imam when he is bowing has not caught up with that rak`ah.” (Narrated by al-Bayhaqi; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Irwa al-Ghalil, 2/262) 
Ibn `Umar said: “Whoever catches up with the imam when he is bowing and bows before the imam raises his head, has caught up with that rak`ah.” (Narrated by al-Bayhaqi and classed as sahih by al-Albani, op. cit., 2/263) 
Similar reports were narrated from Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, Zayd ibn Thabit and ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Zubayr. (See Irwa al-Ghalil, 2/264) 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmu’, 4/112: 
“What we have mentioned about catching up with the rak`ah by catching up with ruku` (bowing) is the correct view, as stated by al-Shafi`i. It was also the view of the majority of our companions and the majority of scholars. It is the apparent meaning of the hadiths and all people are unanimously agreed upon it. There is another view, which is very weak, which suggests that it does not count.” 
It says in ‘Awn al-Ma’bud (3/102): 
“Note that the majority of imams are of the view that whoever catches up with the imam when he is bowing and joins him in the prayer is regarded as having caught up with that rak`ah, even if he did not recite anything. A group was of the view that whoever catches up with the imam when he is bowing has not caught up with that rak`ah. This was the view of Abu Hurayrah. Al-Bukhari narrated this concerning reciting behind the imam from all of those who were of the view that it is obligatory to recite behind the imam. This view was also favoured by Ibn Khuzaymah, al-Sibghi and other Shaf`i muhaddithin. Shaykh Taqiy al-Din al-Subki among the later scholars regarded this as a strong view, and al-Muqbili regarded it as more likely to be correct.”
The view that is more likely to be correct is the view of the majority, because of the hadiths and reports quoted above.
