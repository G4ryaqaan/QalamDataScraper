What is al-lawh al-mahfuz?


Is al-Lawh al-Mahfuz on the forehead of Israfil?","Praise be to Allah.What is al-Lawh?
Ibn Manzur said: 
“Al-Lawh: every wide, flat surface or sheet of wood.
Al-Azhari said: Al-Lawh is a flat surface of wood, and a shoulder-blade [of an animal], if it is written on, may be called a lawh.”
Al-Lawh is something that is written on.
Al-Lawh: al-Lawh al-Mahfuz , as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning), (Inscribed) in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz (the Preserved Tablet) [al-Buruj 85:22] means, the place where the decrees of Allah are kept. 
Every wide bone is a lawh.The plural form is alwah.” (Lisan al-Arab, 2/584)
What is al-lawh al-mahfuz?
Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“In ‘al-Lawh al-Mahfuz (the Preserved Tablet)’ means, it is among the higher group (i.e., angels), preserved and protected from anything being added or taken away, or any alteration or changes.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 4/497, 498)
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“Preserved: most readers recite this with a kasrah, i.e., it is a description of the Lawh. This indicates that the shayatin are not able to bring it down, because its location is protected and they cannot reach it. And it is itself protected, so the Shaytan cannot add anything to it or take anything away from it.
Allah, may He be glorified, has described it as protected or guarded in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):
Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quran) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption). [al-Hijr 15:9]. And its location is also described as being guarded in this surah.
Allah, may He be glorified, is protecting its location, and protecting it from having anything added or taken away, or being distorted. He is protecting its meanings from being twisted, just as He is protecting its words from being changed, and He is protecting its letters so that nothing is added or taken away.” (al-Tabyan fi Aqsam al-Quran, p. 62).
Is al-Lawh al-Mahfuz on the forehead of Israfil?
As for the reports in some books of Tafsir that al-Lawh al-Mahfuz is on the forehead of Israfil or that it was created of green chrysolite, etc., none of these reports have been proven. It is part of the Unseen (al-ghayb) of which we cannot accept any reports except from the one who received Revelation concerning it.

For more, see the detailed answer.","Is it permissible to keep cats in Islam?


Are cats impure in Islam?


What does Islam say about animal welfare?


How Abu Hurayrah got his nickname?","Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible to keep cats in Islam?
It is permissible to keep cats in the house , and there is nothing wrong with that because cats are not harmful or najis (impure). 
With regard to cats not being harmful, no one disputes that, rather they are useful because they eat snakes, rats, bugs and other things that may be in the house or yard. 
Are cats impure in Islam?
With regard to cats not being najis , this is known from the hadith of Kabshah bint Ka’b ibn Malik, who said that Abu Qatadah – her husband's father – entered upon her and she poured water for him to do wudu, and a cat came to drink from it, so he tipped the vessel for it to drink. Kabshah said: “He saw me looking at him and said, “Do you find it strange, O daughter of my brother?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “They (cats) are not najis, rather they are of those who go around amongst you.”’” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 92; al-Nasai, 68; Abu Dawood, 75; Ibn Majah, 367. classed as sahih by al-Albani. Ibn Hajar narrated in al-Talkhis that al-Bukhari classed it as sahih). 
What does Islam say about animal welfare?
It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A woman entered Hell because of a cat which she tied up and did not feed, nor did she let it loose to feed upon the vermin of the earth.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3140; Muslim, 2242). 
The vermin of the earth means insects and mice, etc. 
This hadith does not denounce the woman for keeping a cat, but it demonstrates that the woman’s sin was in not feeding it or leaving it to eat from the vermin of the earth. 
How Abu Hurayrah got his nickname?
The great Sahabi Abu Hurayrah (literally “Father of the Kitten”) was so called because he used to love cats and keep them. He became well known by this name and people forgot his real name, until the scholars disputed concerning his real name and there were nearly thirty different opinions as to what it was. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said in al-Isti'ab: “The most correct view is that his name was ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Sakhr but none of them disputed that he was Abu Hurayrah.”

7019,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7019,Inheritance question,"In light of Quran and sunnah could you please provide information about inheritence in the following situation.

A father has 4 sons and 3 daughters. 1 son dies during the fathers life. Soon afterwards the fathers wife also dies leaving behind some of her own personal property? My questions are: 

1) How is the mothers property shared.

2) How will the fathers inheretence be shared once be passes away in particular with respect to the dead son? The dead son has left behind 2 wives (1 son from the first wife and 3 sons from the second wife). Will the children of the dead son be entitled to anything?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The question mentions “the father’s wife” and later on “the 
    mother.” As the ruling will vary, we will answer the question in such a 
    manner as to address both possibilities. 

    1 – Division of the estate left by the dead son: 

    His two wives get one-eighth, to be divided equally between 
    them. 

    His father gets one-sixth. 

    If the woman referred to in the question was his mother, she 
    gets one-sixth; if she was his father’s wife, she is not his mother and does 
    not have any share. 

    The rest goes to his four sons to be shared out equally 
    amongst them. 

    2 – Division of the estate left by the father’s wife or the 
    mother. 

    If she was the wife of the father and had no children – 
    either from her current husband or from another if she had been married 
    before – then her husband gets one half. The questioner has not told us 
    about the rest of her heirs so we cannot state how the rest of the estate is 
    to be divided. 

    If she had children – either from her current husband or from 
    another – then her husband gets one-quarter. The questioner has not told us 
    about the rest of her heirs. 

    If she was the mother, then her husband gets one-quarter, and 
    her children who were alive at the time of her death get the rest, with the 
    males taking twice the share of the females. 

    3 – Division of the estate left by the father. 

    His wife – if he had a wife – gets one-eighth. 

    The rest is to be given to his children who were alive at the 
    time of his death, with each male taking twice the share of a female. If he 
    did not have a wife, all his estate goes to his children, with each male 
    taking twice the share of a female.  

    With regard to the children of the son who died before him, 
    they do not inherit anything from their grandfather or grandmother. The fact 
    that the son would have inherited if he were still alive does not mean that 
    his share is given to his children if he dies, because the children in this 
    case are prevented from inheriting by the presence of their paternal uncles. 
    This is according to scholarly consensus.

          of Allaah. This is the meaning of Islam, which is submission to Allaah 
          and obedience to His command, whether the wisdom behind it is clear 
          to him or not, because the One Who is issuing the command – Allaah, 
          may He be exalted – is the Creator, the All-Knowing, the All-Aware, 
          who created mankind and knows what is good for them and what is not 
          good for them. Circumcision is one of the rulings of sharee’ah which 
          the Muslim carries out willingly, in submission to and out of love for 
          Allaah, and seeking reward with Him. He is certain that Allaah does 
          not command anything unless there is a wisdom behind it and it is good 
          for His slaves, whether people know that or not. Since your question 
          referred to the health benefits of circumcision, we will, after looking 
          at the shar’i (religious) benefits, will answer your question about 
          the health benefits, in order to increase the believers in faith in 
          the ruling, and so that non-Muslims may see one aspect of the greatness 
          of this sharee’ah (Islamic law) which came to bring benefits and ward 
          off harm.  
1 
          – The shar’i (religious) benefits:
Circumcision is one of the commands 
          concerning beautification enjoined by Allaah, which Allaah has prescribed 
          for His slaves to make them beautiful both outwardly and inwardly (physically 
          and spiritually). It is the perfection of the fitrah (natural 
          state of man) with which He created them, and hence it is the perfection 
          of the haneefiyyah (pure monotheism) of the religion of Ibraaheem 
          (Abraham). The origin of the institution of circumcision as the perfection 
          of haneefiyyah was when Allaah made a covenant with Ibraaheem 
          and promised to make him an imaam (leader) of mankind, and promised 
          him that he would be the father of many people, that prophets and kings 
          would come from his loins and that his descendants would be many. And 
          He told him that between him and his descendants there would be the 
          sign of the covenant, which would be that every newborn male among them 
          would be circumcised, and so the covenant would have this sign on their 
          bodies.  Circumcision is a sign of having entered into the religion 
          of Ibraaheem, and this is in accordance with the interpretation of the 
          verse (interpretation of the meaning) – 
“[Our Sibghah (religion) 
          is] the Sibghah (religion) of Allaah (Islam) and which Sibghah (religion) 
          can be better than Allaah’s? And we are His worshippers” 
[al-Baqarah 
          2:138] – 
as referring 
          to circumcision. 
For 
          the haneefs (pure monotheists, i.e., Muslims), circumcision has 
          the same status as baptism does for the worshippers of the cross (i.e., 
          Christians). They purify their children – as they say – when they baptize 
          them in the baptismal water, and they say, now he has become a Christian. 
          Allaah has prescribed for the haneefs their own rite, the symbol 
          of which is circumcision. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
          
“[Our Sibghah (religion) 
          is] the Sibghah (religion) of Allaah (Islam) and which Sibghah (religion) 
          can be better than Allaah’s? And we are His worshippers” 
[al-Baqarah 
          2:138] –
… So Allaah 
          has made circumcision a symbol of those who belong to Him and to His 
          religion, and who attribute themselves to Him as being utterly enslaved 
          to Him alone…  
The point 
          here is that the religion of Allaah is haneefiyyah (pure monotheism) 
          which fills the heart with knowledge and love of Him and sincerity towards 
          Him, and worship of Him alone with no partner or associate, and which 
          marks the body with the characteristics of the fitrah, namely circumcision, 
          removal of the pubic hair, trimming the moustache, cutting the nails, 
          plucking the hair from the armpits, rinsing the mouth, rinsing the nose, 
          using the siwaak (toothbrush made from twigs from a certain tree) 
          and cleaning oneself after elimination of urine or faeces.  
So the fitrah 
          of Allaah is manifested in the hearts of the haneefs and on their 
          bodies.  
(Tuhfat 
          al-Mawdood bi Ahkaam al-Mawlood by Ibn al-Qayyim, p. 351)  
          
Circumcision 
          also has health benefits and brings a lot of benefits to the boy in 
          his life. (See Question # 2425).  
It is not 
          essential for the child to remain as he is when he comes forth from 
          his mother’s womb, if there is something that may be done for him that 
          serves a purpose and is enjoined by the pure religion. Such things include 
          shaving his head after he is born, because that is in his best interests. 
          The Prophet of Islam 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Remove the harm from 
          him.”  
The same applies 
          to washing the blood from him and cutting the cord by which he was attached 
          to his mother, and other things which are done to benefit him.  
          
2 – The health benefits:  
          
Dr. Muhammad ‘Ali al-Baar (a 
          member of the Royal College of Surgeons in the UK and a consultant to 
          the Islamic Medicine department of the King Fahd Centre for Medical 
          Research in the King Abdul Aziz University in Jeddah) says in his book 
          al-Khitaan (Circumcision):  
“Circumcision of newborn 
          boys (i.e., within the first month of life) brings numerous health benefits, 
          including:  
1 
          – Protection against local infection in the penis, 
          which may result from the presence of the foreskin, causing tightening 
          of the foreskin, which may lead to retention of urine or infections 
          of the glans (tip) of the penis – which require circumcision in order 
          to treat these problems. In chronic cases, the child may be exposed 
          to numerous diseases in the future, the most serious of which is cancer 
          of the penis.
2 
          – Infections of the urethra. Many 
          studies have proven thatuncircumcised 
          boys are more exposed to infection of the urethra. In some studies the 
          rate was 39 times more among uncircumcised boys. In other studies the 
          rate was ten times more. Other studies showed that 95% of children who 
          suffered from infections of the urethra were uncircumcised, whereas 
          the rate among circumcised children did not exceed 5%.  
In children, infection of the 
          urethra is serious in some cases. In the study by Wisewell on 88 children 
          who suffered infections of the urethra, in 36 % of them, the same bacteria 
          was found in the blood also. Three of them contracted meningitis, and 
          two suffered renal failure. Two others died as a result of the spread 
          of the micro-organisms throughout the body.  
3 
          – Protection against cancer of the penis:the studies agree that cancer of the penis is almost non-existent 
          among circumcised men, whereas the rate among uncircumcised men is not 
          insignificant. In the US the rate of penile cancer among circumcised 
          men is zero, whilst among uncircumcised men it is 2.2 in every 100,000 
          of the uncircumcised population. As most of the inhabitants of the US 
          are circumcised, the cases of this cancer there are between 750 and 
          1000 per year. If the population were not circumcised, the number of 
          cases would reach 3000. In countries where boys are not circumcised, 
          such as China, Uganda and Puerto Rico, penile cancer represents between 
          12-22 % of all cancers found in men; this is a very high percentage.  
          
4 
          – Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).Researchers found that the STDs which are transmitted via sexual 
          contact (usually because of fornication/adultery and homosexuality) 
          spread more among those who are not circumcised, especially herpes, 
          soft chancres, syphilis, candida, gonorrhea and genital warts.  
          
There are numerous modern studies 
          which confirm that circumcision reduces the possibility of contracting 
          AIDS when compared to their uncircumcised counterparts. But that does 
          not rule out the possibility of a circumcised man contracting AIDS as 
          the result of sexual contact with a person who has AIDS. Circumcision 
          is not a protection against it, and there is no real way of protecting 
          oneself against the many sexually transmitted diseases apart from avoiding 
          fornication/adultery, promiscuity, homosexuality and other repugnant 
          practices. (From this we can see the wisdom of Islamic sharee’ah in 
          forbidding fornication/adultery and homosexuality).  
5 
          – Protection of wives against cervical cancer. 
          Researchers have noted that the wives of circumcised men have less risk 
          of getting cervical cancer than the wives of uncircumcised men.

This was not reported from any Sahaabi either. The report that Abu Qutaadah asked that he should be turned to face the Qiblah when he died, and that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) approved of this by saying He has followed the fitrah is daeef (weak), not saheeh.
(See Irwaa al-Ghaleel, 3/153, concerning its being daeef).
With regard to how the deceased should be placed in the grave, Imaam Ibn Hazm said:
The deceased should be placed in his grave on his right side, with his face towards the Qiblah and his head and legs to the right and left. This is the practice of the Muslims from the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) until the present day, and this is how all the graveyards of the Muslims are throughout the world. (al-Mahallaa, 5/173).
With regard to the claim that people will be resurrected to the Kabah, this is a matter of the Unseen which needs proof what proof is there? What has been proven is that when the people are resurrected from their graves, they will head directly for the place of their gathering.

7092,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7092,"How should we
    respond when the People of the Book greet us with salaam?","What is the proper way of greeting a
      non-muslim (5%'er,FOI,or Christian)when they greet you with the correct Salam's.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If the Muslim realizes that the kaafir has said to him al-saam 
      alaykum, which means may death be upon you, he should respond 
      in kind by saying wa alaykum (and also upon you).
If he realizes beyond a doubt that he has greeted him with 
      the greeting of Islam (al-salaamu alaykum), Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have 
      mercy on him) said: if the listener realized that the Dhimmi [Jew or Christian] 
      has said salaam alaykum and he is sure of that, should 
      he say wa alayk al-salaam or just wa alayk?
According to the evidence and principles of shareeah, 
    he should say wa alayk al-salaam, because this is more fair, 
    and Allaah commands us to be just and to treat others well.
(Ahkaam Ahl al-Dhimmah, 1/425, 426).
Shaykh Muhammad al-Saalih ibn Uthaymeen (may Allaah 
      preserve him) said:
 These people who have come to us from the 
    east and the west and are not Muslims, it is not permissible for us to initiate 
    the greeting of salaam with them, because the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Do not initiate the 
    greeting of salaam with the Jews and Christians. (Narrated by 
    Muslim in his Saheeh).
If they greet us, then we can respond in a manner similar 
    to that in which they greet us, because Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning):
When you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return 
    with what is better than it, or (at least) return it equally [al-Nisaa 
    4:86].
When they greet us with the greeting of Islam  al-salaamu 
    alaykum  either of the following two cases applies:
Either they pronounce the laam (l-sound) 
    clearly, and say al-salaam alaykum (peace be upon you), 
    so we may say wa alaykum al-salaam or wa alaykum
Or they do not pronounce the laam clearly, 
    and so they say al-saamu alaykum (death be upon you), so 
    we should say wa alaykum only. This is because the Jews 
    used to come to the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) and greet him by saying al-saam alaykum, 
    without pronouncing the laam. Al-saam means death; 
    i.e., they were praying against the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him), praying that he would die. So the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded 
    us to say to them wa alaykum.
Thus, if they say al-saam alaykum, we should 
    reply, wa alaykum, which means: and the same to you, may 
    death be upon you. This is what is indicated by the Sunnah.
But if we initiate the greeting of salaam with them, our 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) forbade us to do this.
(Majmoo Fataawaa Ibn Uthaymeen, 2/97, 
    98).
And Allaah knows best.
