31119,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/31119,"She loves him and he treats her orphaned daughter kindly, but their families refuse to let them marry","I have fallen deeply in love with a very good man, but his family vehemently reject me. The first reason for their rejection is that I was married before and I have a daughter. The other reason is that I previously tricked them with a big lie but now I am trying to make up for that lie, and I pray that Allaah will forgive me and that they will forgive me. Now, praise be to Allaah, I have started to adhere to Islam more, and I have started to wear niqaab and memorize Qur’aan, praise be to Allaah.

My question now is: is our marriage valid without his family’s agreement? Is his marriage to me considered to be disobedience towards them? Even though we love one another very much, and I acknowledge, praise be to Allaah, that this person has changed me a lot and made me more religious.

Is it permissible for me to get married without the consent of a wali (guardian), because my father is insisting that this man’s family must agree to the marriage before he gives his consent, otherwise he will refuse to allow this marriage so long as this man’s family refuse to agree to it. Please note that my father ignores me and rarely asks about me, and this man – may Allaah reward him with good – is the one who is taking care of me and my daughter, giving me love and security and taking the place, for my daughter, of her dead father. He gives her the love and care that her own family does not give her. My daughter and I are in great need of his love and care towards us. I hope that you can advise us. Thank you very much.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Your question, may Allaah bless you, raises a number of 
    issues, some of which are mentioned in the question and some to which 
    attention must be drawn. 

    One of the issues raised in the question is that you ask 
    about having your father’s agreement. You have to realize that sharee’ah 
    stipulates that there must be a wali (guardian) in order for the marriage 
    contract to be valid, because there is a great deal of evidence to that 
    effect, such as the hadeeth in which the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no (valid) nikaah (marriage) without 
    a wali (guardian).” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1101; Abu Dawood, 2085; Ibn 
    Maajah, 1881. It is saheeh as stated in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel by 
    al-Albaani, 6/235). 

    There is great wisdom in what Allaah has prescribed by 
    stipulating that there must be a wali. For example, the basic principle is 
    that men are more perfect in reason, and have more understanding of where 
    interests lie and they have more insight into the circumstances of men and 
    what is suitable for a woman, and they are more able to take decisions, 
    especially since a woman may be overwhelmed and swayed by her emotions. If 
    we assume that there is some fault in the wali that make him unqualified to 
    take responsibility for the woman under his guardianship, or he is 
    preventing her from getting married to a compatible man with no legitimate 
    shar’i reason, then guardianship passes to the next in line, for example 
    from the father to the grandfather. (For more detailed information in this 
    issue, please see Question no. 7193). 

    With regard to his family’s approval, this is not a necessary 
    condition for the marriage to be valid, because the man is his own wali, so 
    his marriage does not require the agreement of his family. They have no 
    right to prevent him from marrying for no legitimate shar’i reason. His 
    concern about their approval, especially his parents, is a good thing, and 
    he may gain their approval by treating his parents well and doing whatever 
    he can to make them agree to his choice, and seeking the help of Allaah in 
    that by making du’aa’, debating with them in a polite manner, and seeking to 
    convince them in gentle ways.  

    We are happy to congratulate you for Allaah’s blessing in 
    enabling you to wear correct Islamic hijaab and to memorize His Holy Book. 
    We ask Allaah to make us and you among those who act in accordance with it. 

    We would like to draw your attention to what you mention in 
    your question about “falling deeply in love”, “we love one another very 
    much”, “he gives us love” and “My daughter and I are in great need of his 
    love and care towards us”. You have to realize that both Muslim men and 
    Muslim woman must protect themselves against the things that may lead to 
    forming an emotional attachment to someone who is not a spouse, whilst 
    accepting that people may not be able to have full control over their 
    emotions. But there are many things that a person may do that may lead to 
    such attachments, and these are the things which are forbidden. For example, 
    chat between a man and woman to converse, which may provoke these emotions 
    and desires. Repeated visits are also forbidden. The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Beware of entering upon women.” 
    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4934; Muslim, 2172). These things are forbidden in 
    order to close the door to things that may develop from them. The wisdom 
    behind this is that it prevents the formation of an emotional attachment to 
    a person whom it may not be easy to marry, which would result in heartache 
    for both parties, examples of which are well known, both ancient and 
    modern.  This may also distract the heart from things which are obligatory, 
    namely loving and obeying Allaah. Ibn al-Qayyim spoke of the damage caused 
    by such attachments in some of his books, such as al-Daa’ wa’l-Dawa’, 
    and Ighaathat al-Lahfaan, which are worth reading. You can also refer 
    to Question no. 9465. 
What we advise you to 
    do, since Allaah has enabled you to wear the hijaab, is to complete the 
    hijaab of cloth with the hijaab of the heart by taking an impartial look at 
    the relationship you have with him now, and keeping away from everything 
    that could make you form an emotional attachment to him, such as speaking to 
    him, letting him visit you and your daughter, etc, which are haraam or 
    nearly haraam. He, since according to what you say he is religious, should 
    keep even further away from such things, lest the Shaytaan intervene between 
    the two of you. 

    With regard to his kindness towards your daughter, we ask 
    Allaah to reward him for that, but that should not result in any haraam 
    action, such as his entering upon you when there is no one else apart from 
    your daughter with you, because her being with you does not cancel out the 
    fact that you are alone together in the haraam way which the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned against when he said: “No 
    man is alone with a (non-mahram) woman but the Shaytaan is the third one 
    present.” (Narrated by Ahmad and by al-Tirmidhi in his Sunan, 2091; 
    see also Saheeh al-Jaami’, 2546). See also Question no. 2986. 

    With regard to your hopes for marriage to him, we advise you 
    to do a number of things: 

    1.Pray istikhaarah a great deal 
    until your Lord chooses for you that which is in your best interests in this 
    world and in the Hereafter. To learn how to pray istikhaarah, please see 
    question no. 2217.

    2.Avoid the things mentioned here 
    that may create an emotional attachment, because the most important means of 
    attaining what one wants is adhering to sharee’ah and keeping within its 
    limits.  

    3.Strive to reduce the intensity 
    of love referred to in the question by understanding the dangers involved, 
    and focus your heart on Allaah and on pondering the meanings of His words 
    with which Allaah has adorned your heart by enabling you to memorize them.

    4.Try to get closer to your 
    father, treat him kindly and strive to honour him. Perhaps that will soften 
    his heart and make him want to do that which will bring you happiness and 
    stability.

    5.Apologize to the man’s family 
    and interact with them in a way that will show them that you regret what you 
    did to them. Perhaps Allaah will open their hearts to this marriage, which 
    will make it easier for your father to accept the idea.

    6.Prepare yourself to accept what 
    Allaah has decreed – even if it is not what you would like – by being 
    prepared for the worst case scenario, such as not being able to get married 
    at all, because when you accept the worst case scenario, it loses its power 
    to shock you, which may lead to frustration or loss of faith, or thinking 
    negatively of Allaah and His wisdom.

    7.Strive to give this orphan whom 
    Allaah has placed in your care an Islamic upbringing, and treat her kindly, 
    for in bringing up and sponsoring an orphan there is great reward which may 
    be the means of bringing blessings to you and divine help in all your 
    affairs.

    We ask Allaah to perfect His blessings upon you and to make 
    faith steadfast in your heart and to help you to do all that is good. May He 
    make this marriage easy if it is good for both of you, and may He guide us 
    all to the straight path. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our 
    Prophet Muhammad and upon his family.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Do we join prayers because of rain in the mosque or at home?","Praise be to Allah.Can you combine prayers because of rain?
There is a concession allowing Maghrib and `Isha’ prayers to be joined at the time of Maghrib, with one Adhan and an Iqamah for each of them, when there is rain that soaks people’s clothes, when going back to the mosque for `Isha’ will cause hardship. This is according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions. 
Similarly it is permissible to join them when it is very muddy, according to the correct scholarly view, so as to avoid hardship and difficulty. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship.” [Al-Hajj 22:78] 
“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.” [Al-Baqarah 2:286]
Aban ibn ‘Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him) joined Maghrib and `Isha’ on rainy nights , when there was a group of senior scholars from among the Tabi`in, and it is not known that any of them objected, so that meant there was consensus. 
That was mentioned by Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) in Al-Mughni. “It is also allowed for a person who is very sick to join Dhuhr and `Asr at the time of either of them, depending on what is easier for him, and he can join Maghrib and `Isha’ likewise, so as to avoid hardship.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah li’l-Buhuth Al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Ifta’, 8/135) 
Do we join prayers because of rain in the mosque or at home?
If it is asked: do we join prayers because of rain in the mosque or at home? The answer is: 
What is prescribed is for the people who pray in the mosque to join their prayers if there is a reason that justifies joining them, such as rain, so as to attain the reward of praying in congregation whilst also being kind to the people. This is what it says in the authentic Hadiths. 
With regard to joining the prayers at home for the reason mentioned, that is not permissible because it is not narrated in Shari`ah and there is no excuse that would permit joining the prayers .” (Fataawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah li’l-Buhuth Al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Ifta’, 8/134)",Islam Q&A
31174,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/31174,Meaning of Abiding for Eternity in Hell,"Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills…” [al-Nisa 4:48] 
“And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell to abide therein…” [al-Nisa 4:93] 
I hope that you could explain how to reconcile these two verses.","Abiding for eternity in Hell is of two types, eternal abiding which never ends, which is the abiding of the unbelievers in Hell.

Meaning of abiding for eternity in Hell for committing murder


Destiny of sinners","Praise be to Allah.Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
Meaning of abiding for eternity in Hell for committing shirk 
 “There is no contradiction between them – praise be to Allah. In the first verse, Allah is telling His slaves that any sin less than shirk (associating others in worship with Him) is subject to His will: He may forgive it by His grace, or He may punish the person who dies in sin in a way commensurate with his sin, because he transgressed the sacred limits of Allah and did that which deserves the wrath of Allah. But the mushrik (one who associates others with Allah) cannot be forgiven, rather he is doomed to Hell for eternity, to abide therein forever, if he dies in shirk – we seek refuge with Allah from that. 
Meaning of abiding for eternity in Hell for committing murder
With regard to the second verse, this is a warning to one who kills a person unlawfully, that he will be punished and that Allah is angry with him for that. Hence Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell to abide therein; and the Wrath and the Curse of Allah are upon him, and a great punishment is prepared for him” [al-Nisa 4:93]
What this means is that this is the punishment if Allah punishes him, and he deserves that; if Allah forgives him then He is All-Forgiving. He may be punished with what Allah mentions of a period of time spent in Hell, then Allah will bring him forth from the Fire. This is a temporary abiding in Hell, which is not like the abiding of the unbelievers. For abiding for eternity in Hell is of two types, eternal abiding which never ends, which is the abiding of the unbelievers in Hell, as Allah says concerning them (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Thus Allah will show them their deeds as regrets for them. And they will never get out of the Fire.” [al-Baqarah 2:167]
And Allah says in Surah al-Maidah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They will long to get out of the Fire, but never will they get out therefrom; and theirs will be a lasting torment.” [al-Maidah 5:37]
Destiny of sinners
With regard to sinners, such as the one who kills a person unlawfully, the one who commits adultery, the one who disobeys his parents, the one who consumes riba, the one who drinks alcohol and so on, if they die in their sin and they are Muslims, then they are subject to the will of Allah, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills…” [al-Nisa 4:48]
So if He wills, He will forgive them because of the righteous deeds with which they died, such as their believing in Allah Alone (Tawheed), their sincerity towards Allah and their being Muslims, or because of the intercession of those who intercede for them, as well as their Tawheed and sincerity. 
Or He may punish them and not forgive them, so He will punish them by causing them to enter Hell and tormenting them therein, in a manner commensurate with their sin, then he will bring them forth therefrom, as is mentioned in many ahadith from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who said that he will intercede for the sinners among his ummah, and that Allah will set a limit for that several times, so he will intercede and bring forth a number of them by Allah’s leave, then he will intercede again and again and again; he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will intercede four times. Similarly the angels, the believers and the children who died before reaching the age of adolescence and before their parents died, will all intercede and Allah will bring forth whomever He wills from the Fire because of their intercession. Then some sinners among those who believed in Tawheed and Islam will be left in Hell, and Allah will bring them forth by His grace and mercy without any intercession, then there will be no one left in Hell except those whom the Quran has ruled will abide therein forever, namely the kuffar. 
Thus the questioner will understand how to reconcile these two verses, and similar texts and the ahadith which promise Paradise to those who die in Islam, except those whom Allah wishes to punish for their sin. And He is the most Wise and most Just in that; He rules as He wills and does what He wants. 
And there are some whom Allah will not punish, by His grace, for many reasons, such as righteous deeds and because of the intercession of the intercessors, and above all that because of His Mercy and Grace.
