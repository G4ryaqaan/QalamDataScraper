due to the corruption of society?","Is it permissible to use birth control so that a person has a child every five years, because he sees the corruption in society and would not be able to raise a lot of children close in age in this overwhelmingly corrupt society?",,,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, may
      Allaah preserve him, who replied:
      
      So long as this is the intention, then it is not permissible to do this,
      because it reflects a lack of trust in Allaah with regard to the hadeeth
      of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) who said
      “Marry the one who is loving and fertile…”
      
      But if the birth control has to do with the condition of the woman –
      because she cannot cope with repeated pregnancies – this may be
      permissible, but it is better not to do it.
      
      Question: Do you mean that it is more important to pay attention to the
      woman’s condition than to the corrupt nature of society?
      
      Answer: Of course, because there is no certainty that
      one’s children will be corrupt; they may be righteous people who will
      bring benefits to society. And Allaah knows best.",Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen
7208,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7208,Did the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commit sin?,"My question is about the Prophet( ). Some muslims believe that he was sinless while others say he was not. I personally dont think he was sinless cause he was just a human. Can u tell me which is true using Quran or Hadith, please? Thank you very much. Allahu Akbar",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: the use of the word “sin” in the question is a grave mistake, because sin (khatee’ah, pl. khataayaa) is impossible in the case of the Messengers. It is more correct to say mistakes, because a mistake may be made unintentionally, which is not the case with sins.
Secondly: with regard to sins, the Messengers, including Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), never committed any sin intentionally as an act of disobedience towards Allah after receiving their Mission (risaalah). This is according to the consensus of the Muslims. They were protected from major sins (kabaa’ir) but not from minor sins (saghaa’ir).
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
The view that the Prophets were protected from major sins (kabaa’ir) but not from minor sins (saghaa’ir) is the view of the majority of the scholars of Islam and all the sects… It is also the view of the majority of the scholars of tafseer and hadeeth, and of the fuqahaa’. Nothing was reported from any of the Salaf, Imaams, Sahaabah, Taabi’een or the successive generation that does not agree with this view.
(Majmaa’ al-Fatawaa, 4/319).
This question was posed to the Standing Committee on this topic:
Question:
Some people, including the heretics, say that the Prophets and Messengers could make mistakes, i.e., they could make mistakes like all other people. They say that the first mistake ever made was when the son of Adam, Qaabeel, killed Haabeel… and when the two angels came to Dawood, he listened to the first and did not listen to what the second had to say… and the story of Yoonus when the big fish swallowed him; and the story of the Messenger with Zayd ibn Haarithah, they say that he concealed something which he should have declared openly; and with his Sahaabah, he told them, “You know better about your worldly affairs,” and they say that this is because he made a mistake in this regard; and what happened with the blind man, which is referred to in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning), “(The Prophet) frowned and turned away, because there came to him the blind man…” [‘Abasa 80:1-2]. Could the Prophets and Messengers really make mistakes? How can we respond to these sinners [who say these things]?
Answer:
Yes, the Prophets and Messengers made mistakes, but Allah did not approve of their mistakes; rather, He pointed out their mistakes as a Mercy to them and their ummahs, and He forgave their mistakes and accepted their repentance as a Grace and Mercy, for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. This will be clear to anyone who checks out the aayaat of the Qur’aan in which the matters raised in the question are discussed… With regard to the sons of Aadam, even though they were not Prophets… Allah explained how evil was the deed which he did to his brother…
(Fatawaa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, no. 6290, 3/194).
Thirdly: before they were given their Mission (risaalah), the scholars have said that it is possible that they may have committed some minor sins, but they were protected from committing major sins such as zinaa, drinking wine, etc.
But after they received their Mission, the correct view is that they may have committed some minor mistakes but this was not approved of and they were rebuked.
Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said:
Most of the reports from the majority of scholars state that they were not infallible with regard to minor mistakes, but they were not allowed to persist in them; they do not say that this could never happen at all. The first suggestion that they were completely infallible came from the Raafidis, who say that they are so infallible that they could never make any mistake even by way of forgetfulness and misunderstanding.
(Majmoo’ al-Fatawaa, 4/320).
They are infallible with regard to conveying the Message from Allah, may He be exalted.
Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
The aayaat which indicate the Prophethood of the Prophets also indicate that they are infallible with regard to the conveying of the Message from Allah; so what they say can only be true. This is the meaning of Prophethood, which implies that Allah tells the Prophet something of the Unseen and he tells it to the people. And the Messenger is commanded to call the people to Allah and to convey the message of his Lord.
(Majmoo’ al-Fatawaa, 18/7)
Fourthly: mistakes which are committed unintentionally are of two types:
With regard to worldly matters: this happened to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). With regard to agriculture, medicine, carpentry, etc., he was like all other people. Allah did not tell us that he was sent to us as a businessman or a farmer or a carpenter or a doctor. His mistakes in these fields are quite natural and do not impact on his Message at all.
It was reported that Raafi’ ibn Khudayj said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Madeenah, and they were pollinating the date-palms. He said, “What are you doing?” They said, “We always used to pollinate them.” He said, “Perhaps if you do not do that, it will be better.” So they did not do it, and the harvest was lacking. They mentioned that to him, and he said, “I am only a human being like you. If I tell you to do something with regard to religion, then follow it, but if I tell you to do something based on my own opinion, I am only a human being.”
(narrated by Muslim, 2361).
We note that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made a mistake in this worldly matter, because he was like all other human beings, but with regard to matters of religion he did not make mistakes.
With regard to unintentional mistakes concerning matters of religion:
The most correct view among the scholars is that the way this happened with regard to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is that he might do something which is OK but it was not the more appropriate choice.
He was sometimes faced with issues concerning which there was no shar’i text on which he could base his decision, so he sought to make ijtihaad based on his own opinion, just as any Muslim scholar may make ijtihaad, and if he makes the right decision, he will be given two rewards, and if he makes the wrong decision, he will still be given one reward. This is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If the judge makes ijtihaad and gets it right, he will have two rewards, and if he makes ijtihaad and gets it wrong, he will have one reward.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6919; Muslim, 1716, from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah).
This also happened to him concerning the prisoners of Badr.
Anas said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) consulted the people concerning the prisoners who had been captured on the day of Badr. He said, “Allah has given you power over them.” ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab stood up and said, “O Messenger of Allah, strike their necks [execute them]!” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) turned away from him. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came back and said, “O people, Allah has given you power over them and they were your brothers.” ‘Umar stood up and said, “O Messenger of Allah, strike their necks [execute them]!” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) turned away from him. Then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came back and said something similar to the people. Abu Bakr stood up and said, “O Messenger of Allah, why don’t you forgive them and accept payment of ransom from them?” The worried expression left the face of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he forgave them and accepted their payment of ransom. Then Allah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning):
“It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war (and free them with ransom) until he had made a great slaughter (among his enemies) in the land. You desire the good of this world (i.e. the money of ransom for freeing the captives), but Allah desires (for you) the Hereafter. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise” [al-Anfaal 8:67]
Narrated by Ahmad (13143).
We may note that in this case, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not have any clear text so he made ijtihaad and consulted his companions, and he made a mistake in deciding what was the best thing to do.
Cases like this are few in the Sunnah. We have to believe that the Messengers and Prophets are infallible, and we know that they did not disobey Allah. We should also beware of the words of those who want to cast aspersions on his conveying of the Message by referring to the fact that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made some mistakes with regard to earthly matters. There is a huge difference between the former and the latter. We should also beware of those misguided people who say that some of the rulings of sharee’ah which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us about are his own personal ijtihaad which could be right or wrong. What would these misguided people say in response to the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): “Nor does he speak of his own desire. It is only an Inspiration that is inspired” [al-Najm 53:3]? We ask Allah to protect us from confusion and misguidance, And Allah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

7222,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7222,"Prohibition of images      and erecting statues, and the effect this has on ‘aqeedah","I am having difficulties explaining to a muslim that erecting a non-muslim statue is haram. His response was this woman was a heroine and fought the muslims to defend her land, and she is my ancester before islamization.. Can a muslim idolize a statue, or erect one in memory of a hero?, even if the hero and/or heroine was not a muslim?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly, it may be understood from your question that what is to be denounced is the fact that the statue is of a kaafir, and that if it was a statue of a Muslim it would be permissible to erect it. This is a mistake, because all statues of animate beings are equally haram, regardless of whether they are made in the images of a Muslim or a kaafir. Indeed, making a statue of a kaafir is worse, because it combines two evils, that of making the statue and that of glorifying this kaafir. 
There follow details of the prohibition on the making of images and statues.
I.The prohibition on statues is not just the matter of fiqh; it goes beyond that to the matter of ‘aqeedah, because Allah is the Only One Who has the power of giving shape to His creation and creating them in the best image. Making images implies that one is trying to match the creation of Allah. The matter also has to do with ‘aqeedah when these images are taken as idols which are worshipped instead of Allah.
Among the daleel (evidence) that image-making is the exclusive preserve of Allah are the following:
1.Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“He it is Who shapes you in the wombs as He wills” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:6]
“And surely, We created you (your father Adam) and then gave you shape (the noble shape of a human being); then We told the angels, ‘Prostrate yourselves to Adam’” [al-A’raaf 7:11]
“He is Allah, the Creator, the Inventor of all things, the Bestower of forms. To Him belong the Best Names. All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify Him. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise” [Al-Hashr 59:24] 
“O man! What has made you careless about your Lord, the Most Generous? Who created you, fashioned you perfectly, and gave you due proportion. In whatever form He willed, He put you together.”[Al-Infitaar 82:6-8]
These aayaat clearly state the belief that creating and giving form to creation is the preserve of their Lord, Creator and Fashioner, so it is not permissiblefor anyone to encroach on that and to try to match the creation of Allah.
2.It was reported from ‘Aa’ishah Umm al-Mu’mineen that Umm Habeebah and Umm Salamah mentioned a church which they had seen in Ethiopia, in which there were images. Theytold the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about it, and he said: “Those people, if there was a righteous man among them and he died, they would build a place of worship over his grave and put images in it. These will be the most evil of creation before Allah on the Day of Resurrection.” (narrated by al-Bukhari, 417; Muslim, 528)
 Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said:
 This hadeeth indicates that making images is haram. (Fath al-Bari, 1/525).
 Al-Nawawi said: 
Ourcompanions and other scholars said: making images of animate beings is extremely haram and is a major sin, because severe warnings have been issued against it in the ahaadeeth. Whether the image is made to be used in a disrespectful fashion or for other purposes, it is haram to make it in all cases, because it implies that one is trying to match the creation of Allah, whether the image is to appear on a garment, carpet, coin, vessel, wall or whatever. With regard to pictures of trees, camel saddles, and other pictures in which no animate beings appear, these are not haram. This is the ruling on making images. (Sharh Muslim, 14/81).
3.Sa’eed ibn Abi’l-Hasan said: I was with Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) when a man came to him and said, O Abu ‘Abbaas, I am a man who lives by what his hands make, and I make these images. Ibn ‘Abbaas said: I will only tell you what I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say. I heard him say: “Whoever makes an image, Allah will punish him until he breathes life into it, and he will never be able to do that.” The man became very upset and his face turned pale, so [Ibn ‘Abbaas] said to him, Woe to you! If you insist on making images, then make images of these trees and everything that does not have a soul. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2112; Muslim, 2110).
4.‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: The people who will be the most severely punished before Allah on the Day of Resurrection will be the image makers. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5606; Muslim, 2109).
5.It was reported from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Those who make these images will be punished on the Day of Resurrection. It will be said to them, Give life to that which you have created! (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5607; Muslim, 2108).
6.It was reported that Abu Hurayrah entered a house in Madeenah and saw somebody making images in it. He said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: [Allah says:] Who does greater wrong than one who goes and creates something like My creation? Let them create a seed or a small ant! (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5609; Muslim, 2111).
 Al-Nawawi said:
 Concerning the words of Allah. “Let them create a small ant or a seed or a grain of barley!” means, let them create a small ant which has a soul and moves by itself, like this small ant which was created by Allah. Or let them createa grain of wheat or barley, i.e., let them create a grain which is eaten as food or which can be planted so it will grow and which has the characteristics of a grain of wheat or barley or other seeds which were created by Allah. This is impossible, as stated above. (Sharh Muslim,14/90). None can bring forth living vegetation out of nothing except Allah, may He be glorified.
7.Abu Juhayfah said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the price of a dog and the price of blood, and he forbade tattooing and asking to be tattooed, and the consumption or paying of ribaa, and he cursed those who make images. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1980).
II.Islam prescribes that idols should be destroyed and smashed, not made and repaired. Among the evidence for this is the following:
1.‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered Makkah [at the Conquest], there were three hundred and sixty idols around the Ka’bah. He started hitting them with his stick and saying, “Truth has come and Baatil (falsehood) has vanished. Surely, Baatil is ever bound to vanish” [al-Israa’ 17:81 – interpretation of the meaning]. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2346; Muslim, 1781).
2.Abu’l-Hiyaaj al-Asadi said: ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib said to me: Shall I not send you on the same basis as the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent me? Do not leave any statue without destroying it, and do not leave any built-up grave without razing it to the ground. (According to one report: and do not leave any picture without erasing it). (narrated by Muslim, 969).
 Ibn al-Qayyim said:
Tamaatheel is the plural of Timthaal (statue), which refers to a representative image.
 Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah) said:
 The command is to destroy two types of images: images which represent the deceased person, and images which are placed on top of graves – because Shirk may come about from both types. (Majmoo’ al-Fatawaa, 17/462).
(al-Fawaa’id, p. 196).
III.The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned against bringing images into the house, and said that this is a sin and deprives a person of good. Among the evidence for that is the following:
 1.Abu Talhah said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or statues.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3053; Muslim, 2106).
 2.‘Aa’ishah Umm al-Mu’mineen (may Allah be pleased with her) said that she bought a pillow on which there were images. When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw it, he stood at the door and did not enter. She saw on his face that he was upset, and said: O Messenger of Allah, I repent to Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). What is my sin? The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: What is this pillow? She said, I bought it for you so that you could sit on it and recline on it. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: On the Day of Resurrection, the makers of these images will be punished and it will be said to them, Give life to that which you have created. And he said: The angels do not enter a house in which there are images. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1999; Muslim, 2107).
  IV.Making images is a way of falling into Shirk, because Shirk starts with the veneration of those who are depicted in the images, especially when people have little or no knowledge. The evidence for this is:
 Ibn ‘Abbaas said: The idols of the people of Nooh were known among the Arabs later on. Wadd belonged to (the tribe of) Kalb in Dawmat al-Jandal. Suwaa’ belonged to Hudhayl. Yaghooth belonged to Muraad, then to Bani Ghutayf in al-Jawf, near Sabaa’. Ya’ooq belonged to Hamadaan. Nasar belonged to Humayr of Aal Dhi’l-Kalaa’. These were names of righteous men from the people of Nooh. When they died, the Shaytaan inspired their people to set up idols in the places where they had used to sit, and to call those idols by their names. They did that but they did not worship them, but after those people died and knowledge had been forgotten, then they started to worship them. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4636).
 Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:
 The reason why al-Laat was worshipped was the veneration of the grave of a righteous man which was there. (Iqtidaa’ al-Siraat al-Mustaqeem, 2/333).
 And he said:
 This problem – i.e., veneration – which is why Islam forbids (images), is the reason why so many of nations have fallen into committing Shirk to a greater or lesser degree. (al-Iqtidaa’, 2/334).
 Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said, describing how the Shaytaan plays with the Christians:
 He plays with them with regard to the images which they have in their churches and which they worship. You cannot find any church which is free of these images of Maryam (Mary), the Messiah, George, Peter and others of their saints and martyrs. Most of them bow to these images and pray to them instead of to Allah. The Patriarch of Alexandria even wrote a letter to the ruler of Rome supporting the idea of bowing to these images: (he said) Allah commanded Moosa to make images of cherubim in the Tabernacle; and when Sulayman the son of Dawood built the Temple, he made images of cherubim and put them inside the Temple. Then he said in his letter: this is like when a king sends a letter to one of his governors and the governor takes the letter and kisses it then touches it to his forehead [a sign of respect], and stands up to receive it. He does not do this to venerate the paper and ink, but to venerate the king. In the same way, when one bows to an image, it is to venerate the person represented by the image, not to venerate the paints and colours.
 This is exactly the same as the example given to justify idol worship. (Ighaathat al-Lahfaan, 2/292).
 And he said:
 In most cases, the reason why nations fall into Shirk is because of images and graves.” (Zaad al-Ma’aad, 3/458).
 V.The aayaat and ahaadeeth quoted above indicate that the prohibition of images is for two reasons:
The first is: because it implies that one is trying to match the creation of Allah.
The second is: because it is an imitation of the kuffaar.
The third is: because it is a means of veneration and falling into Shirk.
From the above it is clear that it is forbidden to make statues, whether the statue is of a Muslim or a kaafir. Whoever does that is trying to match the creation of Allah and thus deserves to be cursed. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound, and to guide us.

7227,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7227,Ruling    on dyeing grey hairs,"I have noticed that some of my colleagues at work have their beard painted or turned into the black color, and when asked they say that it in the SUNNAH to paint in what is called (katm).
My questions are:
1)-Are we allowed in any way to paint our hair (head or beard) with black even if it is with this KATAM ?
2)-What is this KATAM, does have a black color and is it true that some of the SAHABA used it ?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: dyeing grey hairs is Sunnah and is part of the teachings of Islam. It means dyeing grey hairs on the head and in the beard, for men. For women, it refers to the hair of the head.
It was reported that Abu Hurayrah said: the Prophet
(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Jews and the Christians do not dye their hair, so be different from them.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3275; Muslim, 2103).
It was reported that Abu Umaamah (may Allah be pleased him) said: “O Ansaar, dye your hair red and yellow, and be different from the A’aajim (Persians).”
(Narrated by Ahmad, 21780. The isnaad of this hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar in al-Fath, 10/354).
Secondly: changing grey hair by dyeing it black is haraam. This is the opinion of the majority of scholars, who forbid it completely, because of the hadeeth of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), when he saw Abu Quhaafah. Jaabir said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him_ said, when he saw his head looking as white as the thaghaamah plant, “Change this…”
(Narrated by Muslim, 2102).
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: There are people who dye their hair black like the crops of pigeons; they will never smell the fragrance of Paradise.”
(Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4212; al-Nasaa’i, 5075).
Ibn Hajar said: the isnaad of this hadeeth is qawiy (strong), but there is some dispute as to whether it is marfoo’ (narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) or mawqoof (the isnaad stops at the Sahaabi). But even if we agree that it is mawqoof, it still has the status of being marfoo’, because the Sahaabah would not have spoken on the basis of their own opinions, i.e., it must be something that they heard from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)).
Fath al-baari, 6/499.
Thirdly: with regard to katam, Ibn Hajar said:
Katam is a plant from Yemen which produces a reddish-black dye. Henna produces a red dye, so when they are used together as a dye, they produce a colour that is between black and red.
Fath al-Baari, 10/355.
Did the Sahaabah use katam? Yes, they did that and so did the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
It was reported that ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Abd-Allah ibn Wahb said: we entered upon Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) and she brought out a lock of hair of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to show us, and it was dyed red.
(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5558. Ibn Maajah (3623) and Ahmad (25995) added: “… with henna and katam.”)
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best things to use to change grey hair are henna and katam.”
(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1753; Abu Dawood, 4205; Ibn Maajah, 3622). Al-Tirmidhi said: the hadeeth is hasan saheeh). Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) dyed his hair with henna and katam. (Narrated by Muslim, 2341).
Fifthly: it may be noted that in the ahadith where katam is mentioned , it is always accompanied by henna, because what is meant by the ahadith is that the hair should be dyed with katam mixed with henna.
Ibn al-Qayyim said:
What is prohibited is making the hair pure black, but if something else is added to henna, such as katam etc., there is nothing wrong with that. Katam and henna make the hair a colour between red and black, unlike wasmah (woad leaves) which make the hair black as coal. This is saheeh.
(Zaad al-Ma’aad, 4/336).
(Wasmah or woad is a plant that is used for dyeing).
Hence we know that katam is not to be used on its own, because it gives a pure, coal-black colour, but it may be used with henna to give a black colour with reddish highlights. Hence we can reconcile the ahadith. And Allah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Every Friday Khutba that I go to we have a different Imam, What my question is With a community of 6000 and growing is it okay to have different Imams every week or should our Masjid Hire a permenant Imam?  This way if anyone has any questions they dont have to go very far to get a answer, and especially if the Masjid can efford a permenant Imam. May Allah reward you for your Service.",,,"Praise be to Allah.1-	If the mosque can be taken care of by one imaam, and is not one of the large mosques that need the cooperation of more than one imaam, or there is a person who can work full-time as an imaam and you have the financial resources to meet his needs (i.e., pay him a salary), or there is someone who can do this voluntarily, then appointing one imaam and khateeb for the mosque will bring a number of benefits, such as:
      (i)	A regular khateeb will be more able to get to know the problems faced by the people, and thus will be able to play a part in solving them. He will be a point of reference and a leader for the people of the mosque. If the people know that he will be coming back again, this will encourage them to discuss issues and problems with him. 
      (ii)	People will be able to listen to useful things that need to be spoken about in a series of khutbahs, e.g., the tafseer of Soorat al-Faatihah, or the Signs of the Hour, or the battles (of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)), or teaching the salaah (prayer). Such series can usually only be done by one imaam, which is not the case when the khateeb is different each week. 
      (iii)	The people will be able to listen to something new each week, because a regular khateeb will not repeat the same topics too soon, lest he bore the people. He will come up with something new each week, unlike what happens with different imaams who tell the people similar things time and time again, which wastes time that otherwise could be put to good use.
      (iv)	If the khateeb is also the imaam, this is better, because he will know all the matters and problems concerning the people of the mosque. Things may happen during the week to the people of the neighbourhood or those who attend the mosque, which requires the comments of the imaam, or he may refer to them in the Jumu'ah khutbah.
      (v)	This is also in accordance with the teaching of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the khaleefahs who succeeded him, where the imaam and regular khateeb were one and the same.
      2.	You must be very careful to make sure that the imaam is one of the Ahl al-Sunnah and that he follows their 'aqeedah. This is what will benefit you in your religion; anyone else who is a follower of bid'ah will only cause you harm and lead you astray.
      3.	In addition to his having a sound 'aqeedah, he must also be knowledgeable, so that you will hear something useful in his lessons and khutbahs.
      4.	There is no reason why you should not form a committee, including some knowledgeable brothers, to choose an imaam and khateeb, because people's emotions may prevent them from distinguishing between what is beneficial and what is harmful (i.e., they may not make the right choice of imaam). 
      5.	It is not essential for the person to be able to be both imaam and khateeb. Many famous qaari's (readers of Qur'aan) know nothing about the rulings of sharee'ah, and many eloquent khateebs are unsure of the rulings on sujood al-sahw (prostration of forgetfulness), and many knowledgeable people cannot give khutbahs and address the people.
      If it is necessary to have an imaam who is different from the khateeb, there is nothing wrong with that. If the circumstances of the community do not permit one person to be a full-time imaam and khateeb because of study and work commitments, then it is OK to appoint a group of people who are qualified to act as imaams and khateebs, and to draw up a roster so that the mosque will be able to fulfil its responsibilities and not falter in its work. We ask Allaah to help us and you to do that which is good. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
7268,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7268,Muhrim covering his head and using an umbrella for shade,"During hajj, is it permissible to use an umbrella that covers the head and prtects the body from the heat of the sun? this umbrella is however held by supports from the shoulder leaving the two hands free.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The scholars are agreed that covering the head is haraam for a man in ihraam. This is indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning a man who died in ‘Arafah when he was in ihraam: “Wash him with water and lotus leaves, and shroud him in two cloths, and do not put any perfume on him or cover his head, for Allah will resurrect him on the Day of Resurrection reciting the Talbiyah.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1267; Muslim, 1206. 
Al-Bukhaari (1542) and Muslim (1177) narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man said, “O Messenger of Allah, what garments should the muhrim wear?” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “He should not wear a shirt, or a turban, or pants, or a burnoose or khifaaf (shoes).” The burnoose is a garment worn by the people of the Maghreb (North Africa) which has a hood attached. 
Secondly: 
The muhrim’s covering his head is of various kinds: 
1 – Covering it with something that stays on the head, such as a hat or turban and the like. This is haraam. The evidence for it being haraam is the two hadeeth quoted above. 
2 – Covering his head with something that does not stay on it, such as an umbrella, tent, car roof etc. There is nothing wrong with this, because Umm Husayn (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “I performed Hajj with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) during the Farewell Pilgrimage, and I saw him when he stoned Jamarat al-‘Aqabah and went away on his mount, accompanied by Bilaal and Usaamah. One of them was leading his mount and the other was holding his garment over the head of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), shading him from the sun. Narrated by Muslim, 1298. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
This indicates that it is permissible for the muhrim to shade his head with a cloth or whatever. This is our view and the view of the majority of scholars. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: this is exactly like an umbrella. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz said: There is nothing wrong with the muhrim using an umbrella to shield himself from the sun, or shading himself in a tent or under the roof of a car. Fatawa Ibn Baaz, 17/115. 
3 – Carrying one’s luggage on one's head. There is nothing wrong with this because it is usually not done with the intention of covering the head. If it is done with that intention then it is haraam. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz said: 
Carrying luggage is not covering the head, it is like the muhrim carrying food and the like, so long as he is not doing that as a trick (to get around the ruling), because Allah has forbidden His slaves to use trickery in order to do things that He has forbidden. 
Fatawa Ibn Baaz, 17/115

7277,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7277,What Is the Meaning of Bid’ah?,Can you kindly define and provide examples of bid’ah? This is an issue that is very confusing. Is it a bid’ah to pray more than 8 Rak`ahs for tarawih since our Prophet never performed it?,"1- Bid'ah means something that has been introduced into the religion of Allah that has no general or specific basis to support it.
2- There is nothing wrong with praying more than 8 rak’ahs in Taraweeh prayer. For more, see the detailed answer.","The meaning of bid’ah


Praying more than 8 rak’ahs in Tarawih","Praise be to Allah.The meaning of bid’ah
The root of the word bid’ah in Arabic means initiating something without any precedent. For example, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“The Originator of the heavens and the earth…” [al-Baqarah 2:117]
In the terminology of Shari’ah, bid’ah means something that has been introduced into the religion of Allah that has no general or specific basis to support it.
For example, the innovated adhkar (dhikr) such as saying the name of Allah on its own (“Allah…Allah… Allah”) or the pronoun (“Hu… Hu… Hu…”, meaning “He… He… He…”). This is a new thing that has been innovated in the religion, intended as worship of Allah, but there is no evidence for this, either specific or general… so it is bid’ah .
Praying more than 8 rak’ahs in Tarawih
With regard to praying more than 8 rak’ahs in Tarawih , the Sunnah as reported in the sahih ahadith, and as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did regularly, is to pray eleven rak’ahs at night. He used to pray eight rak’ahs (saying Tasleem after each two rak’ahs in most cases), ending with two rak’ahs of shaf’ and one rak’ah of witr.
He sometimes prayed thirteen rak’ahs, as was narrated in the hadith of ‘Aishah and Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both). Doing more than this is permitted, but it is not Sunnah. What indicates that it is permissible is the sahih hadith in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Night prayer is two by two” – meaning two rak’ahs by two rak’ahs; he did not limit it to a set number.”

7284,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7284,Virtues of the Day of Arafah,What are the Virtues of the Day of Arafah?,"Here are some virtues of the Day of Arafah: 1- Fasting on this day is an expiation for two years, 2- It is the day of forgiveness of sins, 3- It is a day of ‘Eid.",,"Praise be to Allah.The virtues of the Day of Arafah are as follows:

It is the day on which the religion was perfected and Allah’s Favour was completed.

In Al-Sahihayn it was reported from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) that a Jewish man said to him, “O Amir al-Muminin, there is a verse in your Book which you recite; if it had come to us Jews, we would have taken that day as an ‘Eid (festival).” ‘Umar said, “Which verse?” He said: {This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.} [al-Maidah 5:3 – interpretation of the meaning]. ‘Umar said, “We know on which day and in which place that was revealed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It was when he was standing in ‘Arafah on a Friday.” 

It is a day of ‘Eid for the people who are in that place.

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Yawm ‘Arafah (the day of ‘Arafah), Yawm al-Nahr (the Day of Sacrifice ) and Ayyam al-Tashriq (the 3 days following Yawm al-Nahr) are ‘Eid (festival) for us, the people of Islam. These are days of eating and drinking.” This was narrated by the authors of al-Sunan. It was reported that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab said: “It – i.e., the verse ‘This day I have perfected…’ was revealed on a Friday, the Day of ‘Arafah, both of which – praise be to Allah – are ‘Eids for us.” 

It is a day by which Allah swore an oath.

The Almighty cannot swear by anything except that which is mighty. Yawm ‘Arafah is the “witnessed day” mentioned in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):
“By the witnessing day [Friday] and by the witnessed day [the Day of ‘Arafah].” [al-Buruj 85:3]
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The promised day is the Day of Resurrection, the witnessed day is the Day of ‘Arafah, and the witnessing day is Friday.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi and classed as sahih by al-Albani) 
It is the “odd” [i.e., odd-numbered, Witr] by which Allah swore in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):
“And by the even and the odd” [al-Fajr 89:3]. Ibn 'Abbas said: “The even is the Day of al-Adha [i.e., 10th Dhu’l-Hijjah] and the odd is the Day of ‘Arafah [i.e., 9th Dhu’l-Hijjah] This is also the view of ‘Ikrimah and al-Dahhak. 

Fasting on this day is an expiation for two years.

Abu Qatadah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about fasting on the Day of ‘Arafah . He said, “It expiates for the sins of the previous year and of the coming year.” Narrated by Muslim. 
This (fasting) is mustahabb for those who are not on Hajj. In the case of the one who is on Hajj, it is not Sunnah for him to fast on the Day of ‘Arafah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not fast on this day in ‘Arafah. It was narrated that he forbade fasting on the Day of ‘Arafah in ‘Arafah. 

It is the day on which Allah took the covenant from the progeny of Adam.

Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah took the covenant from the loins of Adam in Na’man, i.e., ‘Arafah. He brought forth from his loins all his offspring and spread them before Him, then He addressed them, and said: Am I not your Lord? They said, ‘Yes, we testify,’ lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection: ‘Verily, we have been unaware of this.’ Or lest you should say: ‘It was only our fathers aforetime who took others as partners in worship along with Allah, and we were (merely their) descendents after them; will You then destroy us because of the deeds of men who practiced Al-Batil (i.e., polytheism and committing crimes and sins, invoking and worshipping others besides Allah)? [al-A’raf 7:172-173 – interpretation of the meaning].” (Narrated by Ahmad and classed as sahih by al-Albani) And there is no greater day than this and no greater covenant than this.  

It is the day of forgiveness of sins, freedom from the Fire and pride in the people who are there:

In Sahih Muslim it was narrated from ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no day on which Allah frees more people from the Fire than the Day of ‘Arafah. He comes close and expresses His pride to the angels, saying, ‘What do these people want?’”
Ibn ‘Umar narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah expresses His pride to His angels at the last part of the day on the Day of ‘Arafah, about the people of ‘Arafah. He says, ‘Look at My slaves who have come unkempt and dusty.’” (Narrated by Ahmad and classed as sahih by al-Albani)

7294,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7294,"Does
    Islam permit bidding in auctions?","I am working for an Internet Auction
      company. I want to know if Islam permits bidding in auctions.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly:
Islam permits selling by auctions and does not forbid it, according to
    the most correct and well-known opinion of the scholars. This is based on the following
    evidence:
Jaabir said: A man had decided that a slave of his would be manumitted
        after his death, but later on he was in need of money, so the Prophet 
 (peace and
        blessings of Allaah be upon him) took the slave and said, “Who will buy this slave
        from me?” Nu’aym ibn ‘Abd-Allaah bought him, and he (the Prophet 
 (peace
        and blessings of Allaah be upon him) handed the slave over to him. (Narrated by
        al-Bukhaari, 2034; Muslim, 997). Al-Bukhaari included this hadeeth in a chapter titled
        “Baab bay’ al-Muzaayadah (Chapter: selling by auction).”
      
    
    Ibn Hajar said: Ibn Battaal replied that the words of
    the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in this hadeeth, “Who will
    buy this slave from me?” indicate that he was offering him to the highest bidder so
    that the needs of the bankrupt man for whom he was selling him could be met. (Fath
    al-Baari, 4/354).
    
      2. ‘Ataa’ said: I met some people who saw
      nothing wrong with selling booty to the highest bidder. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari in Kitaab
      al-Buyoo’ (the book of sales), Baab bay’ al-Muzaayadah (Chapter:
      selling by auction)).
Secondly:
Rational evidence:
In an auction, the vendor offers his goods for sale, and the purchaser
    offers to buy them for a certain price. If the vendor does not accept that price, that is
    the end of the matter and there is no transaction. The he will say, “Who will offer
    more?” A second purchaser can then offer a higher price, and so on. 
In this case, each offer is a separate and independent deal, and there
    is nothing wrong with that.
Thirdly:
Some scholars, such as al-Oozaa’i and Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh, said
    that auctions can be used only to sell booty and inherited goods. Their evidence was the
    following hadeeth:
“The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him) forbade anyone of you from seeking to outbid one another, except in the case of booty
    and inherited goods.”
(Narrated by Ahmad, 5398; al-Daaraqutni, 3/11; al-Bayhaqi, 5/344;
    al-Tabaraani in al-Awsat, 8/198).
The response to the view is:
The hadeeth is weak, because it includes ‘Abd-Allaah ibn
    Lahee’ah.
The hadeeth of Jaabir is general, and the ruling remains general in
    application.
Hence Imaam al-Tirmidhi said:
On the basis of the hadeeth of Jaabir, some scholars did not see
    anything wrong with selling booty or inherited goods to the highest bidder.
Ibn al-‘Arabi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
There is no point on restricting auctions only to these two kinds of
    goods. There is no difference between these goods and others; they are all the same.
(See Fath al-Baari, 4/354).
Fourthly:
Some scholars, including Ibraaheem al-Nakha’i, regarded this kind
    of sale as makrooh. Their evidence was the hadeeth of Sufyaan ibn Wahb:
“I heard the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah
    be upon him) forbid selling by auction.”
Response:
The hadeeth was narrated by al-Bazzaar, but it is weak, because it
        includes Ibn Lahee’ah. (See Fath al-Baari, 4/354).
      
      
      It is contradicted by reports which are more sound, as we have stated
        above.
Fifthly:
There is no contradiction between auctions and a man outbidding his
    brother, which is forbidden according to the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah: “The Messenger
    of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade a city-dweller to sell to a
    Bedouin, and he forbade us to inflate prices artificially and to outbid one another.”
    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2033; Muslim, 1413).
    What is meant by this hadeeth is when the vendor and
    purchaser have come to an agreement and are bargaining over the price, and a third party
    comes and tempts the purchaser to cancel the transaction. But this does not apply to
    auctions, because in an auction it is the vendor who cancels the transaction by asking who
    will offer more; the people who are present at an auction are already involved, and
    everyone is aware that anyone may increase the price.
Sixthly:
The warning against engaging in najsh (artificially inflating prices
    with a fraudulent intention). In Arabic the word najsh means provoking, and is also used
    to refer to the action of prodding a bird to enter a trap. It refers to pushing the
    purchaser to fall into the vendor’s trap so that he buys at an inflated price. This
    is achieved by having another man attend the auction and make bids without wanting to buy,
    in order to raise the price. Whether this is done by agreement with the vendor or not, it
    is prohibited by the hadeeth, “The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) forbade artificial inflation of prices.” (Narrated by
    al-Bukhaari, 2035; Muslim, 1516).
    In conclusion: auctions are one of the types of sale
    that are permitted according to Islamic sharee’ah. This is also the consensus of the
    Muslims in their marketplaces.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
