The same is true if he were to move from one faucet to another in search of water.
However, if continuity were disrupted due to an action not related to this, like removing impurity from his clothes, eating or drinking and the like, and the limbs became dry, then he needs to repeat the Wudu.

  then he should repeat salaat from the last sleep he thinks the janaba occurred1. 
  The references (adillah) on the religious duty of performing ghusl due to janaba

  due to sexual discharge (junob) unless you are traveling about until you perform 
  ghusl"" (4:43). And Ali's narration (hadith), (may Allah be pleased with

  wash your male organ and perform wudu' same as wudu' of salaat. If semen appears,

Is male circumcision mandatory in Islam?


Is circumcision necessary for conversion to Islam?","Praise be to Allah.Thank you for submitting this question. The issue of circumcision is one of the issues which in several cases forms a barrier for some of those who want to enter the religion of Islam. The matter is easier than many people think. 
Male circumcision in Islam
As for circumcision, it is one of the symbols of Islam. It is part of sound human nature (fitrah), and is part of the way of Ibrahim (peace be upon him). Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Then We revealed to you, [O Muhammad], to follow the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth.” [an-Nahl 16:123]
The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) circumcised himself when he was eighty years old…” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6/388)
Is male circumcision mandatory in Islam?
Circumcision is obligatory for a Muslim man, if he is able to do it. If he is not able to do it, such as if he fears that he may die if he is circumcised, or if a trustworthy doctor has told him that it will lead to haemorrhaging that may cause his death, then he is exempt from circumcision in that case, and he is not sinning if he does not do it.
Is circumcision necessary for conversion to Islam?
It is not appropriate under any circumstances to let the issue of circumcision be a barrier that prevents a person from entering the faith; rather the soundness of a person’s Islam does not depend upon him being circumcised. A person’s entering the religion of Islam is valid even if he does not get circumcised .
With regard to the issue of female circumcision, you will find the answer in question no. 427  .

5,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5,When Can You Pray After a Miscarriage?,"If a woman has a miscarriage and has discharge of blood, does she pray?","If you see blood after the abortion of a clot, then it is not nifas. So you should perform wudu for every prayer when the time for it is due and pray.",,"Praise be to Allah.This case depends on the type of blood. Is the blood what is known as post-natal bleeding (nifas) or vaginal bleeding (istihadah ) (but not part of her regular period)? 
The scholars have declared the regulation in this matter. They said: 
""If she sees the blood after the abortion of a formed human being, then it is nifas; if she sees blood after the abortion of a clot, then it is not nifas."" (Al-Mughni ma' al-Sharh al-Kabir 1/361) 
In the latter case, she is considered to be mustahada, so she performs wudu for every prayer when the time for it is due and she prays. 
Whereas if the aborted object is a fetus or has human-formed organs like an arm or a leg or a head, then it is considered nifas. 
For the case where the aborted object is disposed of in the hospital before the woman saw it, the scholars have mentioned that the least amount of time human form starts to take place is eighty one days after pregnancy.  (Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin 4/292)
This is based on the report of ‘Abdullah Bin Mas’ud's hadith (may Allah be pleased with him), in which he said that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) spoke to us, and he is the truthful and believed one, and said: ""Each one of you, human creation, forms in his mother's womb for forty days, then he is a hanging clot for the same amount of time, then he is a mudghah (the size of a morsel) for the same amount of time, then Allah sends an angel who is commanded with four things: he is told to write his deeds, his livelihood and sustenance, whether he is happy or distressed "" (Sahih al-Buhari 6/303)
Ladies in this case should spend the effort to find out from the doctors' estimations until her situation is clear to her.
As for the blood that is discharged just prior to a normal delivery, if it is accompanied with the pains of contraction, then it is nifas, and if not, then it is not. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taimiyyah (may the mercy of Allah be upon him) said: ""What she sees when the contractions commence is nifas. What is referred to here is contractions after which follows delivery; otherwise it is not nifas."" (Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin 4/327)

He said: ""I applied this advice and Allah has rid me of him.” (Sahih Muslim, 2203) 
Tips on how to stay focused in prayer
This hadith includes two ways on how to get rid of the shaytan while praying .

Seeking refuge in Allah from the Shaytan's evil by pronouncing the words of seeking refuge and this is OK in this case. 
Blowing with mist to the left three times. This is basically blowing air in a similar manner to spitting, but with a minute mist of saliva, on the condition that this does not disturb or bother the person next to him, nor make the masjid dirty.

The question of, “does he repeat Maghrib?” has two scholarly opinions:

The first is that he repeats Maghrib. This is the saying of Ibn `Umar, Malik, Abu Hanifah and Ahmad in what is most well-known about this issue. 
The second opinion is that he does not repeat Maghrib. This is the saying of Ibn `Abbas, the Shafi`i School of Fiqh, and the second opinion of Ahmad’s school of Fiqh.

The latter is more correct, for Allah did not make it obligatory on the person to offer a prayer twice if he has feared Allah as much as he can. (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Taymiyyah 22/106)

12,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12,How to pray if not sure imam is traveling or resident,"If a traveling person comes upon a congregation praying, and he does 
not know if: (1) the imam (prayer leader) is a traveler, meaning that he 
should join the prayer with the intention of qasr (shortening prayer), or 
(2) if he is resident, and thus should pray the complete prayer, what 
should he do?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The answer that is apparent is: he acts based on what is clear 
  to him from the signs of travel on the imam from clothes or travel gear. 
  If it appears to him that the imam is resident, then he should pray the 
  complete prayer.
The evidence: what Imam Ahmad authenticated and narrated 
  that Ibn Abbas was asked: ""What is reason that the traveler prays 
  two rakaat (iterations of prayer) if he is alone and four rakaat 
  if he is led in [a full] prayer by a resident? So he said, that is the sunna 
  (tradition of the Prophet ), 
  and in another narration ""That is the sunna of Abi Al-Qasim.""
Take the case of one who assumes that the imam is a traveler, 
  and thus prays with him two rakaat with intention of qasr. Then, 
  after salaam (completion of prayer) with the imam, it becomes 
  clear to him [from speaking with others after the prayer, for example] that 
  the imam is actually a resident and that the two rakaat that he 
  had prayed were the imam’s third and fourth. In such an instance, 
  he should stand up and make two rakaat to complete the prayer, he makes 
  sujood sahw (an extra two prostrations). Whatever speaking was 
  done or questions asked to investigate do not harm his prayer.1

prayer, or he was unable to pray standing up so he was praying sitting 
down, then he became able to stand again, what should he do?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Ibn Qudama, (may the mercy of Allah be upon him), said: 
  ""As soon as the ill person during prayer is able to do what he was not 
  able to do when he commenced the prayer, whether it be standing, sitting, bowing,

  The evidence is: hadith Umran Bin Hossayn, (may Allah be pleased with

passing.","What should one do if one is distracted during the prayer by something 
happening in ones environment, such as someone knocking on the 
door, or a child in danger, e.g. playing with an electrical outlet, etc., 
perhaps requiring him to move?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If a person praying needs to do something relatively minor during 
  prayer, like opening a door and the like, it is OK as long as his direction 
  does not change from the qibla (direction of prayer). The evidence for 
  this is what Abu Dawood narrated that Aa'isha (may Allah be 
  pleased with her), said, ""The Messenger of Allah  
  (peace be upon him), used to pray with the door closed, so I arrived and asked 
  him to open it, so he came and opened it and returned to his prayer"" (the 
  narrator mentioned that the door was in the direction of the qibla).1
The same is true if a mother needed, while praying, to save her 
  child from danger or harm and the likesmall movement to the right or left, 
  or forward or backward, does not harm the prayer. Similarly if the ridaa 
  (upper body cover) falls off, the praying person can pick it up and if the izar 
  (lower body cover) became loose, then he can tighten it up. The sharia 
  (laws of Islam) have allowed for the praying person in some cases excessive 
  movement even if he were to change direction from qibla, as evident in 
  the hadith of Abu Huraira, (may Allah be pleased with him), where he 
  said: ""The Messenger of Allah  (peace be upon 
  him), said: Kill the two black things while in prayer: the snake and scorpion. 
  ""2
Also, preventing a person from passing in the place of prostration 
  by pushing (or even fighting him if he insists) is prescribed, as related in 
  Bukhari from hadith Abi Saleh Al-Samman, who said: ""I saw Aba 
  Saeed Al-Khudri on Friday praying with something in front of him to protect 
  him from [passing] people, and a young man from Bani Abi Muaet wanted to pass 
  in front of him in the place of prostration. So Abu Saeed pushed the mans 
  chest, so the man looked [around] and did not find any place from which to walk 
  except in front of him, so he tried to pass in front of him again. Abu Saeed 
  pushed him harsher than the first time, so he cursed Abu Saeed. Then the young 
  man went to Marwan and complained about Abu Saeeds action and Abu Saeed 
  entered after him at Marwans place so Marwan said: What is the matter 
  with you, doing that to your brothers son oh Abu Saeed.? He said: 
  I heard the Prophet  (peace be upon him) saying: 
  ""If one of you prays with something in front of him protecting him from 
  [passing] people, and someone wants to pass in front of him, then he should 
  push him, and if he refuses to [turn back], then fight him, for he is a shaitan

Another man says he committed fornication outside his country, and he knows that the woman conceived and delivered a child. Is this his child? And is it obligatory for him to bear the costs of the child’s upbringing?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Questions of this sort are 
    asked so often and by so many that it is time Muslims paid serious attention 
    to their reformation in the light of the Quran and Sunnah (prophetic 
    teachings), in order that such things do not occur in the first place. 
    Special stress is to be placed on the lowering of the gaze, no bodily 
    contact (including shaking hands) between men and women, wearing of the full 
    hijab (women’s Islamic dress code), prohibition of meetings in secrecy in 
    particular and of mixing of sexes in general, discouraging unwarranted 
    travel to non-Muslim countries, and early marriages. As for the question 
    about one who committed fornication, there can be two situations.

    Either the man did it by force, 
    that is, raped the woman. Such a man should pay her the amount of mahr 
    (dower) in accordance with her social class, as compensation for what harm 
    he caused her. As for himself, he should sincerely repent. And, if the 
    matter has reached the authorities, then he should be punished according to 
    the law of shari’ah (Islamic law). See Madarij. Or, he has had sex with a 
    woman who consented to the act. There is nothing due from such a man except 
    repentance. Neither the child is his, nor is the cost of upbringing born by 
    him because it is an illegal child and must be attached to the mother and 
    not the father. 

    The man’s marriage to the 
    woman, for the sake of covering up the issue, is also not permissible. For 
    Allah revealed in the Quran a verse whose meaning can be translated as: “An 
    adulterer does not marry but an adulteress or mushrika (female polytheist). 
    And an adulteress does not marry but an adulterer or mushrik (male 
    polytheist).” (24:3)

    It is also not permissible to 
    marry a woman who is pregnant from an adulterous act, even if the man has 
    fathered the baby in the womb, as it is also not permissible to marry a 
    woman about whom it is not known if she is pregnant or not.

    Nonetheless, if he repents, and 
    she also repents, and she is not carrying a child, then it is permissible 
    for him to marry her and begin a new life. If she is carrying a child, they 
    must wait until she gives birth.

Announce their repentance and renounce all that they used to spread in antagonism to Islam, in order that the renunciation becomes well known, and so that no one can claim to be misguided by their disowned writings.

He should do so even if it is during the prohibited times of prayer because there is a reason behind it. The evidence for this comes from what has been narrated in the hadith of Yazid bin Al-Aswad (may Allah be pleased with him) in Sunan Al-Tirmidhi in the chapter on “What has been reported about a person who prayed alone and then joins a congregation”:
“He said: I performed Hajj with the Prophet (peace be upon him) and prayed Fajr with him in Masjid Al-Khayf. When he completed his prayer and turned around, he found two people who did not pray with him. He said: I have to talk to them. So he came to them and they were trembling. He asked them: What prevented you two from praying with us? They said: O Prophet of Allah! We had already prayed in our places. He said: Do not do that. If you already prayed at your places and then came to a congregational mosque, pray with them too and it will become a supererogatory prayer for you.”
(Sunan Al-Tirmidhi, No. 219; Sahih Al-Jami‘, No. 667)
 In another hadith it is narrated that the two came after the Fajr prayer which is a prohibited time for prayer. Imam Malik has reported in Muwatta in the chapter on “What has been narrated about repeating the prayer with the Imam after a person has prayed individually”:
Mihjan (may Allah be pleased with him), says that he was in the company of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) prayed in congregation and returned while Mihjan himself did not pray with them. So the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: What prevented you from praying with the people? Are you not a Muslim? He said: Indeed, O Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him)! But I had already prayed at home. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: When you come (to the mosque) then pray with the people even if you have prayed.”

So, if one has performed the ruku‘ for the second rak‘ah, then he

because what is left from his sujud and tashahhud is not needed any

during a prayer?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If there is a congregation praying, and during their prayer they are informed about the 
right direction of qiblah, they should all turn towards the correct direction. The same is 
also true for someone praying individually. Whatever part of their prayer has been 
performed (before changing direction) will be correct. The evidence for this a narration 
by Imam Muslim from Anas (may Allah be please with him), that:
While the Prophet 
 (peace be upon him) was praying towards 
Bayt-al-Maqdis (Jerusalem), the verse was revealed to him (translation of 
meaning): 
Verily! We have seen the turning of your face towards 
the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a qiblah that 
shall please you, so turn your face in the direction of 
Al-Masjid Al-Haram. 
  (Al-Baqarah, 2:144). 
A man from Bani Salamah was passing by and found 
them (i.e., the people of Bani Salamah) in the state of 
ruku‘ in the Fajr prayer in the second rak‘ah. He 
shouted to them: Indeed the qiblah has been changed. 
So, turn to the qiblah as they (i.e., the Prophet 
 
and his Companions) have. 
  (Sahih Musim, No. 527) 
 If some of the people were informed and the others were not, then the one to whom it 
was made clear should turn to the direction he believes to be the correct direction of 
qiblah. Now if all of these people (who were informed or not) were originally praying 
together in the same direction, and some of them turned towards right and some 
towards left, it is correct for some to follow others. But the scholars have a difference 
of opinion about some people following others in the situation where there was 
complete disagreement (among the praying people) about the direction of the qiblah. If 
there was someone among them who was completely ignorant about the direction, he 
should follow the one who is more aware amongst them of the direction of the qiblah.1 
For the one who was uninformed about the direction f the qiblah, must ask someone if 
he can, or else he should make ijtihad (make a judgment based on the best of his ability 
with the information available) if he is able to, otherwise he must follow someone who is 
reliable. If he cannot find one, then he should do his best in obedience to Allah and 
complete his prayer, and his prayer is correct. This sometimes happens to a number of 
those who travel to the lands of disbelievers and find no Muslim around them to inform 
them of the correct direction of qiblah.
If one was capable of finding out the direction of the qiblah, but was neglectful and 
prayed without making all possible efforts, he should repeat his prayer because he was 
careless.2

41,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41,"One praying behind the imam misses a rukn (obligatory part) of the 
prayer","What should one do if one is praying behind an imam and one misses one 
of the obligatory parts (arkaan)of the prayer?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If someone is praying in a congregation and the loud speaker stops working or the 
person is drowsy, and he lags behind the Imam by one or more obligatory acts 
(arkaan) of prayer (i.e., the Imam performed it and he could not because of not hearing 
the Imam’s voice), then when he returns to consciousness or the sound of the speaker 
returns back, he should complete the missed obligatory acts and then continue with the 
Imam. This situation has many cases. Take for example the following case: the Imam 
recited a verse that contains the word of prostration (sajdah) and the people 
misunderstood it to be an actual verse of prostration while in reality it is not, so when 
the Imam says takbeer for ruku‘ at the end of the verse and performs ruku‘, some of 
the followers (especially those towards the rear of the rows) take it to be the takbeer for 
the prostration of recital, thus going into prostration. When the Imam stands up from 
the ruku‘ saying “sami‘a Allahu li man hamidah”, they return back (stand up) from 
their prostration. Thus, they missed the act of ruku‘ and standing up from it. So it is 
incumbent on them to complete what they missed and then catch up with the Imam. 
This is because they did not do it intentionally. However, for the one who intentionally 
lags behind the Imam (e.g., someone who prolongs his prostration to make a long 
supplication such that he misses the obligatory act which is after the prostration) the 
majority of the scholars say that the prayer of someone who misses two consecutive 
obligatory acts of prayer without a valid excuse, is void and he is sinful.1 However, in 
principle the Imam must be followed as said by the Prophet 
 (peace be upon 
him):
The Imam is selected to be followed; the, do not differ with him. When he makes 
the takbeer, make the takbeer, when he goes into ruku‘, make ruku‘. When he 
says “samia‘ Allahu li man hamidah” (Allah hears he who praises Him), say 
“Rabbanaa lakal Hamd” (O our Lord! To You belongs the Praise). When he 
goes into sajdah, make sajdah. If he prays sitting, then all should be sitting.   (Sahih Al-Bukhari, No. 689)",Kashshaf Al-Qanna‘ 1/467; Al-Mausu‘ah Al-Fiqhiyyah 6/29

if he suddenly recalls that he in fact was not in a state of wudu’ in the first 
place? What should he do? Is the prayer of the people praying behind him 
still valid or do they need to make up all or part of it?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If the Imam enters the state that nullifies his ablution or prayer, or remembers during the 
prayer that he did not perform ablution, then he should come out from prayer and 
appoint someone from the attendees who can lead them to completion. This has been 
narrated from ‘Umar, ‘Ali, ‘Alqamah and ‘Ataa’. If he did not appoint anyone and the 
people prayed individually, this would be acceptable, and this is the opinion taken by 
Imam Al-Shafi‘i. If he elected someone and advanced him to lead them, that is also 
permitted. The evidence for this is what has been narrated regarding ‘Umar (may Allah 
be pleased with him) when he was stabbed. He took Abdur Rahman bin ‘Auf who led 
the prayer to completion.1
And the reason for this deduction is that ‘Umar did so in the presence of a number of 
Companions and others and no one opposed this act, so it became a consensus 
(ijma‘).2
If the Imam remembers that he is not in a state of purity, he should indicate to the 
followers to remain as they are and purify himself and come back to lead them. The 
evidence for this is the following narration of Abu Dawud from Abu Bakrah:
The Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) entered into the Fajr prayer and 
indicated to the people that they should stay in their places. Then he came back to 
lead them and water was dripping from his head. 
  (Sunan Abi Dawud, No. 233; Sahih Sunan Abi Dawud, 1/45) 
 Commenting on this hadith, Imam Al-Khatabi says:
 In this hadith there is an evidence that if one is leading the people in prayer while in a 
state of impurity and the people do no know of it, then their prayer is unaffected and 
there is no need for them to repeat it. But the Imam has to repeat his prayer.3
If one is praying (either as Imam or follower or individually) and recalls that he had 
wiped over his socks during wudu’ while the duration of wiping had expired, he should 
terminate his prayer because his ablution is incorrect. This is what has been quoted from 
Imams Ahmad and Al-Shafi‘i.4

that he had recited at-tahiyyaat (the greetings mentioned during the 
sitting) in the beginning of the rak‘ah instead of Al-Fatihah, he 
should stand up and offer another rak‘ah, which is correct in 
exchange for the one he performed incorrectly and did not recite 
Al-Fatihah. This is because the Prophet 
 (peace be upon him) 
said:
There is no prayer for the one who did not recite (in it) 
Al-Fatihah (the opening chapter of the Qur’an).   (Sahih Al-Bukhari, No. 723) 
It is also required for the followers to follow him even though it 
would be the fifth rak‘ah for them. If they do not understand and do 
not stand up, and say “subhan Allah” to indicate to Imam that he is 
error, the Imam should inform them by hand movements to the right 
and left to tell them that he did it purposefully and to indicate to them 
to stand up.
However, if something like this happens to one of the followers 
behind the Imam, his prayer will be correct as long as he followed his 
Imam.
The evidence for this is the Hadith of Abu Bakrah when he entered 
into the prayer in the position of ruku‘ and did not recite Al-Fatihah. 
The Prophet 
 (peace be upon him) said to him:
May Allah increase your endeavor. You do not need to repeat. 
(Sahih Al-Bukhari, No. 750) 
If the follower forgets to recite Al-Fatihah or is ignorant of its 
obligatory nature or finds the Imam in the state of ruku‘, then his 
rak‘ah will be considered as complete and his prayer correct. He 
does not need to repeat the rak‘ah, as he is his excused due to 
ignorance or forgetfulness or if he missed catching the qiyam (the 
position standing upright). This is the opinion of the majority of 
scholars.1

remembers that he did not say the supplications of ruku‘, he should not return

has been dropped by virtue of his rising it. If he returns back to the ruku‘
intentionally, this action would render his prayer invalid since he added an extra rukn
(pillar, or obligatory act of the prayer) which is this second superfluous ruku‘.
However, if he did it in ignorance or forgetfulness, his prayer will not be nullified, but
in this case he must make the prostration of forgetfulness if he was praying individually
or leading a congregation. This is because tasbeeh (subhaana Rabbi al-Azeem, How
Perfect is my Lord, the Supreme, or another supplication of ruku‘) is wajib
(required), and forgetting it makes the prostration of forgetfulness necessary. If he was

If he does return knowing that his return is unapproved of, his prayer will be nullified because he has already started another obligatory act. Due to his missing the wajib (i.e., tashahhud ) he is forced to make the prostrations of forgetfulness . 
The evidence is the hadith narrated by Al-Mughirah bin Shu‘bah that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: If the Imam stands up after the second rak`ah, and remembers that he has to sit, before he straightens himself (upright), then he should sit down, and if he straightened upright, he should not sit and make two prostrations of forgetfulness .
(Abu Dawud, No. 1036; Silsilah Al-Sahihah, 321)
In short, if someone stands up for the third rak`ah, forgetting the tashahhud , he is in one of the three situations:

He remembers it before standing up straight: then he should return to tashahhud.
He remembers after standing up straight, and before starting the recitation of Al-Fatihah: then it is better for him not to sit, but if he sits his prayer will be correct.
He remembers it after starting the recitation of Al-Fatihah: then he is not allowed to return to tashahhud. (al-Mughni 1/677)

For example, suppose a woman has a normal period of 6 days. However, during a given month blood continued to flow until 15 days had passed, while she was still waiting for the end of the period. In this case, she makes ghusl immediately, and starts praying , and prays all the prayers for the 9 days counted from the end of her normal period until she made ghusl.
The reason for this is that the longest that a woman's menstrual cycle can be is 15 days according to Imam Ahmed and many scholars (al-Mughni 1:388). 
Thus, if the flow continues past 15 days , then everything after the number of days in a normal cycle is considered istihadah (which is blood that flows from a woman due to reasons other than menstruation, such as from a burst vein, hemorrhage, etc.)

If he whose character and deen (practice of religion) 
pleases you, approaches you in marriage, then marry 
him, for if you dont, their will be fitna in the land and 
vast corruption. (Tirmidhi and others, see Sunan 
Tirmidhi #1085 and it is hassan (reliable) as per Sahih 
ul-Jaami #270). (fitna here can be understood to 
refer to the temptation for fornication, enmity and the 
cutting off of relations among the people and relatives, 
and the spreading of hatred)
The second:
Buraida (may Allah be pleased with him) said that a 
young woman came to the Prophet 
  (peace be 
upon him) and said, My father married me to his 
brothers son (i.e. her cousin) in order to raise his 
standing among the people, so the Prophet 
  
(peace be upon him) put the matter in her hands (i.e. 
asserted that the validity of the marriage is conditioned 
on her approval and negated by her refusal). So she 
said, I authorize and endorse what he has done but I 
wanted women to know that fathers cannot force their 
will in these matters.
And it was narrated by NisaaI via Abdullah ibn 
Buraida via Aaisha that a young woman came to her 
and said, My father married me to his brothers son in 
order to raise his standing among the people and I am 
unwilling (to agree to it), so she said, Sit until the 
Prophet 
  (peace be upon him) comes. So the 
Prophet 
  (peace be upon him) came and she 
informed him of the situation, so he sent for her father 
and invited him (over) and asserted that the matter is in 
the brides hands. So she said, Oh Prophet of Allah I 
have authorized and endorsed what my father has done, 
but I wanted to know if women had a say in the matter 
or not. (Sunan al-NisaaI, Kitaab al-Nikaah min

Conditions to marry a second wife in Islam


Second marriage in Islam: Do you need permission from your first wife?","Praise be to Allah.Man-woman relationship before marriage
Before responding to this question, a comment must be made regarding an objectionable and reprehensible issue implied in the question, and that is the mentioning by the sister that he “falls in love with another woman”. 
It is known that it is not permissible in the Islamic religion to establish a relationship between a man and a woman who is ajanabiyya to him (lit. foreign, i.e., marriageable) before marriage, for Allah revealed in Surat al-Maidah (the Table), ayah 5 a verse whose meaning can be translated as:
“This day are (all) things good and pure made lawful unto you. The food of the People of the Book is lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them. (Lawful unto you in marriage) are (not only) chaste and virtuous women who are believers, but chaste women among People of the Book, revealed before your time, when you give them their due dowers, and desire chastity, not lewdness, nor secret intrigues. If anyone rejects faith, fruitless is his work, and in the Hereafter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost (all spiritual good).”
 And the word “akhdan” that appears in this ayah (appearing above as “secret intrigues”) means intimate friend or companion, and in this case refers to a lover , and Allah has indicated in Surat al-Ahzab (33:53) that a condition for talking with women when it is needed is: (a translation of the meaning)
 “…and if you ask them (women) for something you want, ask them from behind a hijab (both in the sense of a physical barrier such as a screen or wall, as well as in clothing); that makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs…”
And Allah has commanded women not to speak with soft, sensual voices with a man who is ajnabi (lit. foreign, meaning one to whom marriage is not forbidden) so that he is not tempted by their voices, and so as not to provoke feelings of lust. Allah ta'ala said in Surat al-Ahzab, ayah 32, a verse whose meaning can be translated as:
“… if you do fear (Allah) be not too complacent of speech lest one in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire; but utter sufficient and appropriate speech.” (33:32)
So how could it possibly be permissible after all of these injunctions to establish love or friendship relations among women and men who are ajanib (marriageable)?
Conditions to marry a second wife in Islam
And as for the original matter of the question, Allah (subhanahu wa-ta’ala), Who is al-Hakim (All Wise) al-Khabir (All Experienced), and Who is more knowledgeable about the human beings He created than they themselves are about themselves, has ordained that a man is allowed to marry whom he wills among women as long as he does not bond in marriage under his care and responsibility more than four women . 
And this is conditioned upon him dealing justly among them the known justice specified by Shari’ah which includes overnight stays and spending. 
If he does not have the ability and capacity to deal with such justice , then he should suffice with one, as Allah indicates in Surat al-Nisa in ayah 3, which has a meaning that can be translated as:
“… marry women of your choice, two, or three, or four; but if you fear that you will not be able to deal justly (with them) then only one…” (4:3)
And Allah’s Shari’ah (law) is all just and wise, and He ordains what He wills and does what He wants and it is incumbent upon as human beings to believe and have faith and submit and obey and abide by the Shari`ah, otherwise then we are not Muslims nor mu’minin (believers). As Allah also said in Surat al-Nisa, ayah 65, a verse whose meaning can be translated as:
“But no, by your Lord, they can have no (real) faith until they make you judge in all disputes between them, and find in their souls no resistance against your decisions, but accept them with the fullest conviction” (4:65)
and in Surat al-Ahzab, ayah 36, a meaning that can be translated as:
“It is not fitting for a mu’min (believing man) or mu’minah (believing woman) when a matter has been decided by Allah and His Messenger to have any option about their decision: if anyone disobeys Allah and His Apostle he is indeed strayed on a manifestly wrong path.” (33:36)
Second marriage in Islam: Do you need permission from your first wife?
Furthermore, no evidence appears either in the Quran or sunnah requiring the permission of the first wife if her husband wishes to marry another wife, and therefore he is not required to ask her permission. 
However, he needs to be judicious in taking this decision and to weigh it carefully with respect to benefits and drawbacks and to look with the eye of wisdom at all of the considerations pertaining to the matter, and he should strive all he can to conciliate, reassure, and satisfy his first wife, in order to ease and mitigate the effect of the matter upon her.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

How much is Nesab el-Zakat in US dollars?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Nisab ul-Zakat for naqd (gold and silver) is defined as the minimum amount of naqd specified by shari’a below which one is not required to pay zakat, whereas if one’s wealth exceeds it then zakat becomes incumbent.
And it is known that zakat ul-maal (wealth) in shari’a is required for the two types of naqd—gold and silver—and what serves their function in modern times (commonly referred to as cash), whether it is dollars or riyals or pounds or otherwise.
Nisab for gold as our Prophet (peace be upon him) has informed us (and for currencies made from gold) is 20 mithqaalan, a measure which is equivalent to 85 grams of pure gold (1 mithqaal = 4.25 grams). It becomes incumbent upon anyone who owns such an amount in any form to pay zakat on it in the amount of 2.5%.
Nisab for silver and currencies made from silver is 200 dirhams, which is equivalent to 595 grams of pure silver (1 dirham = 2.975 grams). Likewise, it becomes incumbent upon anyone who owns such an amount in any form to pay zakat on it in the amount of 2.5%.
It is well known that there is a noticeable disparity between the value of nisab for gold and that of silver in our times. The best and most conservative for a poor person is to assess how many dollars he has that have been in his possession for a complete lunar year (Hijri, which is 354 days). If the amount reaches the value of nisaab for silver or more, then he should pay from it for every 1000 dollars, 25 dollars (i.e., 2.5%) to be spent in the prescribed benficiaries as specified by shari’ah, and we ask Allah to aid us and help us succeed in haqq il-maal wa salla allahu ala nabiyyana muhammad",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

79,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/79,Ruling on Congregational Prayer in the Mosque,"Dear brother in faith.
I start with the name of Allah. I would like to thank you for your prompt response for our previous question which was of a great help to our community (All thanks be to Allah).
What is the Islamic point-of-view regarding those who attend Friday prayers in the Masjid and fail to attend any other of the daily prayers? Do you have to attend the prayers at the Masjid if time permits?",,,"Praise be to Allah.All Praise is due to Allah A- Evidence From The Quran
First Evidence
Our Lord tabaraka wa ta'aala said what may be translated as {And when you [i.e., the commander of an army] are among them and lead them in prayer, let a group of them stand [in prayer] with you and let them carry their arms. And when they have prostrated, let them be [in position] behind you and have the other group come forward which has not [yet] prayed and let them pray with you} (Quran 4:102)
I say:

In the verse is an order to establish salat, and the order was repeated once more, ""and let the other party ...""
There is evidence here that jama'ah meaning congregational prayer is obligatory on all because the obligation did not fall from being upon the second party simply by the congregation of the first party.
Allah has commanded a congregational prayer while they are in a state of war and fear, and if it were only a sunnah then it would have been better to abandon the congregational prayer; however, since Allah has ordered it, and obligations like following the Imam are allowed to be violated in order for the second party to pray behind the Imam. This proves clearly that the congregational prayer is obligatory.
This is a clear proof, and there is none amongst Muslims (scholars) that denies the salat of fear ordered in this verse.

Second Evidence
Our Lord the Exalted has said what may be translated as ""The day that a Shin shall be laid bare, and they shall be summoned to prostrate, but they shall not be able to. Their eyes will be cast down, ignominy will cover them, seeing that they had been summoned aforetime to bow in adoration while they were whole, and had refused."" (Quran 68:42-43)
The evidence here is from several facets amongst them:

Allah punished them because they did not answer the call to prostrate.
The one that is calling to salat is the one calling Athan. As has been explained by the hadith of Ibn Abi Maktoom: the Prophet told him ""do you hear Hayya Alassalat, Hayya Alalfalah (parts of the call to prayer)""? He said yes, then the Prophet said ""fahayhala"" which means something like ""then go answer the call."" This hadith is sahih (which means sound, and authentic) and is narrated by Abu Dawood and Ahmad.
So he learned that the one who does not answer the call, has not answered.

Third Evidence
Allah ta'aala said what might be translated as ""Establish salat and pay your zakat and bow with those that are bowing"". (Quran 2:43)
The proof therein is:

That Allah ordered us to bow, and meaning salat because it is a pillar of the salat.
His statement which was translated as ""with those that are bowing"" is an order to bow with those that are bowing, and that is not accomplished except through congregation. So this is evidence that salat al-jama'ah is obligatory because the meaning of the verse is not accomplished except through congregation.

B- Evidence From The Sunnah
First Evidence
Abu Huraira narrated that the Messenger of Allah said ""The heaviest salat for the hypocrite is that of Isha'a and Fajr and if they knew what was in them they would have attended them even if it meant crawling, and I have a strong desire to order the salat to be established, then order a man to lead the people in salat then I would go with some men carrying bundles of wood to a people not attending the salat and burn their houses on them."" Agreed upon by Bukhari and Muslim, and this was Muslim's version.
This hadith proves that salat al-jama'ah is obligatory because one's house would not be burned for leaving a sunnah.
Those of the opinion that salat al-jama'ah is not obligatory find refuge in a few excuses with regards to this hadith which follow:

They said this punishment is in reference to those that do not attend the Jum'ah (Friday) prayer, and their evidence in this regard is the hadith of Abdullah Bin Mas'ood narrated by Muslim that the Prophet said to a people that miss the Friday prayer ""I have a strong desire to order a person to lead the salat and I would burn the homes of those that have missed the Friday prayer"". This is not in contradiction to the hadith of Abu Huraira because Ibn Mas'ood is stating that the burning is for those that miss the Friday prayer, and Abu Huraira is stating that the burning is for those that miss salat al-jama'ah and there is no contradiction between the two because the hadith of Abu Huraira clearly states the Isha'a and Fajr and it is likely that what is meant is to show that both cases are worthy of the burning.
They say: This has been abrogated! My reply is: Where is the proof that this has been abrogated, and who has narrated it? However, to simply claim abrogation without evidence is a forgery upon Allah which is not backed by any knowledge.
They say: The Prophet wanted to burn their houses because they were hypocrites, not because they did not attend the prayer in congregation. The best rebuttal of this statement was given by Ibn Al-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy upon him in his statement, ...as for your claim that he wanted to punish them because of their hypocrisy, and not for missing the congregation this implies two errors:

 
The first: cancelling what the Messenger confirmed and related to missing the congregation.
The second: Confirming what the Messenger cancelled. For he never punished the hypocrites for their hypocrisy; to the contrary, he used to accept from them what they announced, and left what they concealed between them and Allah.
As such the hadith of Abu Huraira remains a strong argument for the obligation of salat al jama'ah.
Second Evidence
What Muslim narrated in his Sahih that a blind man said, ""Oh Messenger of Allah, I do not have someone to guide me to the Mosque,"" and thus asked the Messenger to grant him special permission not to attend congregational prayers. As he was leaving, the Messenger called him and said ""Do you hear the call? "", he said ""yes"". He said, ""Then answer."" Authentic versions narrated by Ahmed and others came as: narrated by Ibn Maktoom that he said: ""Oh Messenger of Allah, I am blind, live far away, and have a guide that does not suit me, so can't you give me consent to pray at home?"" He said ""Do you hear the call?"" Ibn Maktoom replied ""Yes"". The Prophet then said ""I cannot find an excuse for you"". If the blind man has no excuse not to pray in congregation, how can there be an excuse for the one that can see?
Those that conclude salat al-jama'ah to be sunnah say, ""This is an order to pray in congregation that implies the preference not the obligation of salat al-jama'ah"".
The response to this is that since the order here was unrestricted one needs supportive evidence to conclude that it was only meant to show preference. Now how about supportive evidence confirming salat al-jama'ah to be obligatory.
If supportive evidence were not necessary to conclude that an order was stated to imply preference then each and every order could be understood to have been implying preference, and nothing would remain obligatory.
Third Evidence
Narrated by Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them (him, and his father), that the Prophet said, ""Whosover hears the call to salat, and does not respond, then there is no salat for him unless he has a valid excuse."" This is a sound, and authentic hadith.
Ibn Al-Qayyim wrote in his Risalat Assalat ""... and mind you this chain (referring to chain of narration of the above hadith) is authentic."" This hadith has been narrated by Abu Dawood, Ibn Majah, Daar qutni, Al-Hakim, Al-Baghawi, Bayhaqi, and has also been traced and judged authentic by the following scholars: Al-Thahabi, Al-Nawawi, Ibn Hajar Al Asqalani, Ibn Taimiya, Ibn Qayyim Al, and Al-Albani. Some have spoken about this hadith, claiming that its chain is stopped (literal translation for the Arabic word mawqoof; however, the authentic chains of narrations which have been traced to the Prophet contradict their claim.
That hadith states that whoever does not answer the call, there is no salat for him, and this judgment would not be passed to someone who is simply going against an order which implies preference, and not obligation.
Fourth Evidence
Abdullah Bin Mas'ood said: who ever would be pleased to meet Allah as a Muslim, then let him take care of those salat which are called to because they are of the ways of huda (guidance), and Allah has given to your Prophet the ways of huda. And if you were to establish salat in your homes, like that person staying behind in his home, you would be abandoning the sunnah of your Prophet, and if you were to abandon the sunnah of your prophet you would surely go astray. And there is not a man amongst you that purifies himself (yatatahhar), and does so properly, then directs himself to one of these mosques except that Allah will write for him with each step he takes a hasanah (merit), and raises him a grade, and drops from him a sayyi'ah (demerit). And I have seen us, where not one of us would stay behind from prayer in congregation except for a hypocrite whose hypocrisy is known. And one that could not come on his own would be carried between two men until he is stood in the row.
In another narration he said, ""the Messenger of Allah taught us the ways of huda, and amongst the ways of huda is salat in the Mosque in which Athan is called"". Narrated by Muslim.
The evidence in this hadith is that not praying in congregation is considered a sign of confirmed hypocrisy.
It is known that the signs of hypocrisy are those of abandoning something which is obligatory, or doing something which is haram (unlawful.) And there is not a Muslim in whose heart iman (faith) has established itself, that would want to be like the hypocrites in their attributes.
Fifth Evidence

Ibu Sa'eed Al-Khudry said that the Messenger of Allah said, ""If there are three let one of them be their Imam, and the one with the strongest right to be Imam is the one that is the best reciter of the Quran (both in terms of the amount memorized, and ability to recite it properly)"".
Abu Ad-Darda'a said that the Messenger of Allah said ""There are not three in a town where no Athan is called, and congregational prayers are not established amongst them except that the Sheitan will overcome them, so you must stick to jama'ah because the wolf gets the stray one"". Authentic hadith narrated by Abu Dawood and Ahmed.

Sixth Evidence
Abu Asha'a'thaa'a Al-Muharibi said: We were sitting in the masjid (mosque) then the Mu'athin (the one that makes the call to prayer) made the call to prayer. Then a man got up from the masjid walking. Abu Huraira followed him with his sight until he left the Masjid. Then Abu Huraira said ""as for this person he has disobeyed Abal Qasim (the Messenger) "". Narrated by Muslim.
Abu Huraira, may Allah be pleased with him, judged this man as having disobeyed Abal Qasim , and Abu Huraira would not have passed this verdict without knowledge of the sunnah of Abal Qasim . And whosoever is considered among the disobedient then he has left something which is obligatory.
These, my Muslim brothers are some of the pieces of evidence that oblige the Muslim servant to pray in congregation, and whoever ponders in the Quran and Sunnah will find more and more.
Each piece of the preceding evidence is enough in itself to be proof that salat al-jama'ah is obligatory. We also remind our brothers that the Muslim servant is not allowed to reject anything from Allah or his Messenger just because a certain scholar ruled differently. Evidence is an argument against all people. Imam's that have concluded differently are expected to have a valid excuse because even they cannot contradict clear evidence from Quran and Sunnah. Their teachings that people must follow Quran and Sunnah are well known, and they, may Allah have mercy upon them, did not become Imam's except by strong adherence to Quran and Sunnah.
Know this because it is beneficial to you...
Of Allah's bounty upon us with regards to this issue is that the best of people, the companions of the Messenger , have had Ijma'a (consensus) in it. There are no narrations passed down from any one of them giving leave not to pray in congregation. And following is what has been confirmed by them:

Ibn Mas'ood said, ""and I have seen us, where not one of us would stay behind except for a hypocrite whose hypocrisy was known."" (5th evidence)
Ibn Mas'ood, Abu Musa Al-Ash'ary, Ali, Abu Huraira, Ayesha, and Ibn Abbas have stated, ""Whoever hears the call to salat and does not answer, there is no salat for him unless he has a valid excuse."" (3rd evidence)

Ibn Al-Qayyim said after he presented the statements of the companions: ""These are statements of the companions as you find them, authentic and well known, and there is not one known statement from any of the companions which contradicts this. Each of these pieces of evidence is enough all by itself, so how about when they all enforce one another. Verily in Allah is our success.""
These are the statements of the people of knowledge:

Al-Baghawi wrote in Sharh Assunnah (3/349), ""More than one of the companions were of the opinion that whoever hears the call and does not answer, then there is no salat for him.""
Ata'a bin Rabah said, ""There is no excuse for anyone created by Allah in a city or country side not to attend if he hears the call to prayer.""
Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, ""If his mother forbids him from praying Isha'a in congregation, out of pity, he should not obey her.
Al-Awza'i said: ""There is no obedience to the father in leaving the Friday prayer, or the daily congregational prayers, regardless of whether one heard the call to prayer or not.""
Amongst those that have said that it is obligatory as well are Ibn Khuzaima, Al-Shafi'i, Al-Bukhari, Ibn Hibban, Dawood, Ahl Al-Dhahir, Hanabila, Ishaaq, and most of Ahl Al-hadith, and some of the companions of Al-Shafi'i.

You now know, may Allah have mercy upon you, the preceding evidence concerning the obligatory status of salat al-jama'ah,and the statements of those that conclude it as such from amongst the pious predecessors of our Ummah (nation.)
Now what remains for you to know is that whoever prays alone, then his prayer is correct; however, he has the ithm (sin) of leaving the jama'ah (congregation). As for the acceptance, or rejection, this is up to The Creator, and no one can say that the prayer of Zaid is accepted while the prayer of Obaid is not.

If a person is performing tawaf (circumambulation around the Ka`bah) or sa`i (between Safa and Marwah), and he comes across a need (e.g., he is thirsty and wants to drink something, or loses someone from his family members and stops to look for him, or becomes tired and wants to take some rest), and if the break was short, then he may continue his tawaf from where he left off . 
Can you interrupt tawaf for prayer?
If the prayer is called and he interrupts his tawaf to pray , the scholars have disagreed on this issue. The most conservative opinion is that when he continues his tawaf, he should not count the last round which he left incomplete.
Can you take a rest in tawaf and sa`i?
The issue of taking a rest in tawaf and sa`i , however, is based on the condition that tawaf and sa`i should be completed contiguously. 
Continuity in tawaf and sa`i
In sa`i, continuity is not a requirement according to the best opinion.
So, if a person is performing sa`i, and he breaks after some of the rounds, and then comes back to complete them, this would be considered permissible. 
However, regarding continuity of tawaf , the scholars have two opinions:

That continuity is mandatory, and that a long discontinuity without due justification nullifies the tawaf.
That continuity is a sunnah, and the tawaf is not nullified even though the break was long. However, it is better to act according to the first opinion.

84,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/84,Minimum Distance for Shortening Prayer,"What is the distance which, once one has set out for it, allows one to shorten the prayer?",The majority of scholars view that the distance for one who has undertaken its travel in shortening the prayer is equivalent to 88.7 kms.,,"Praise be to Allah.The majority of scholars comprising the Malikis and the Shafi’is and the Hanbalis have taken the opinion that the recognized distance for one who has undertaken its travel in shortening the prayer is four burud (an antiquated unit of distance), which is two average day's travel by heavily-loaded camels (equivalent to 88.7 km in distance). 
Among what they have quoted as evidence is what was authentically (sahih) narrated by Ibn ‘Umar and Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) that they used to shorten the prayers and break fasting at a distance of four BURUD. 
This quoted distance is approximate and not exactly limited as per the majority of scholars, and thus what is slightly less is exempted as well.
Some scholars including Ibn Qadamah and Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and his pupil Ibn al-Qayyim have taken the opinion that all that is referred to as travel in practice and in language, and requires preparation of provisions as well as rest and similar things, falls under the licenses of shari'ah such as the shortening of the prayer and breaking the fast of Ramadan. 
Their pretext and justification is the generalization in the wording referring to the shortening of the prayer as it appears in the Quran and sunnah, as in the example of Surat al-Nisa, verses 4:101-102:
""When you travel through the earth, there is no blame on you if you shorten your prayers, for fear the unbelievers may attack you: for the unbelievers are unto you open enemies. When you (O Messenger) are with them, and stand to lead them in prayer, let one party of them stand up (in prayer) with you taking their arms with them; when they finish their prostrations, let them take their positions in the rear. And let the other party come up - which has not yet prayed - and let them pray with you, taking all precautions, and bearing arms: the unbelievers wish, if you were careless of your arms and your baggage, to assault you in a single rush. But there is no blame on you if you put away your arms because of the inconvenience of rain or because you are ill; but take (every) precaution for yourselves. For the unbelievers Allah has prepared a humiliating punishment.""
And in the following hadith: Al-Tirmidhi, hadith 2960: Ya'la bin Umayyah said: I said to `Umar ibn al-Khattab ""Verily Allah has said ' if you shorten your prayers, for fear the unbelievers may attack you' and now the people feel secure."" 'Umar said, ""[Indeed] I wondered the same thing you are wondering, so I mentioned it to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and he said '[It is] a charity that Allah has bestowed upon you so accept His charity.' "" (Abu 'Isa said this hadith is hasan sahih.)
Al-Tirmidhi, hadith 453: Umayyah ibn ‘Abdullah ibn Khalid ibn Asid said to Ibn `Umar, ""How can you shorten the prayer when Allah the Almighty has said, 'there is no blame on you if you shorten your prayers, for fear' ,"" so Ibn `Umar said, ""O son of my brother, verily the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) came to us when we were misguided, so he taught us, and among what he taught us was that Allah the Almighty has ordered us to pray two raka'ahs during travel."" (Al-Shu'aithiy said that al-Zuhriy used to relate this hadith via ‘Abdullah ibn Abu Bakr.)
The verse expresses the permission for shortening the prayer for one who travels without specifically restricting the distance . Thus the Quran and sunnah mention ""travel"" and do not differentiate a particular travel from another, and as such if one travels via air for one hour without any burden or hardship it would be permissible for him or her to shorten the prayer and break the mandatory fast. In fact, this is the most viable opinion, unless for a particular case there is confusion as to whether it is commonly regarded as travel or not, in which case one falls back to the opinion of the majority of scholars (regarding the minimum required distance).

93,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/93,Libaas ul-shuhrah and wearing extravagant clothing,What is the ruling on libaas ul-shuhrah or the wearing of extravagant clothing?,,,"Praise be to Allah.All praise and thanks be to Allaah the Lord of the worlds.
Regarding your question about the prohibition of so-called ""libaas ul-shuhrah"" (lit. dress of high repute, 
i.e. to show-off or as a status symbol), there is a sound and truthful hadith narrated by Abdullah ibn 
Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both) that Allah's messenger Muhammad  (peace be upon 
him) said: ""He who wears libaas ul-shuhra in this world will be dressed in humiliating clothes on the 
day of judgment."" (narrated by Ahmed & Abu Dawood, confirmed sahih by Al Albani in Sahih Al-Jami' 
6526)
Those who wear libaas ul-shuhrah will be punished on the day of judgment in accordance with their 
deeds (as you sow, so you reap), provided that he/she meant sovereignty and supremacy upon mankind. 
In return, Allaah Almighty will humiliate him/her on the day of judgment and will suppress him/her to 
put-on such a dress for which people would despise him/her and mock at him/her (as you sow, so you 
reap). 
The question here is: "" What consists libaas ul-shurah?"" What is meant by this expression is a anything 
worn to show-off and to attract the attentions of others, so as to look upwards unto him/her once he/she 
appears wearing it. This, of course is due either to its strange colors amongst the ordinary dresses of 
other people or due to the stylish models or even to how precious, expensive or even to the contrary of 
this as being trivial and completely valueless.
Hence, our righteous forefathers (may Allaah have mercy upon their souls) used to hate, disregard and 
even despise either extremity of the fame-clothing: i.e. those which are highly bombastic & precious 
and/or vise versa alike.
All we wish of His All-Mighty is to grant us the righteous clothing and save us in this world and in the 
hereafter. Aameen.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
94,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/94,Repenting but Repeatedly Sinning,I fall into sin and then repent. But my base self overcomes me and I fall into it again. Does this nullify my earlier repentance leaving the previous sins intact and not forgiven?,,,"Praise be to Allah.In the opinion of the majority of scholars it is not a condition for a repentance to be accepted that the penitent does not fall into the same sin again. It is a condition that the sin be given up immediately and that there should be true feelings of regret in the heart. This should be accompanied by the firm intention not to fall into it again. Now, with these conditions met, if he falls into it again, then this will be considered a new sin altogether, requiring a new repentance and with no connection to those of the past.

95,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/95,Repentance for Neglecting Acts of Worship,"I have neglected many rights of Allah in the past, such as prayers, fasts, and zakah (paying poor-due). Am I required to repeat them or to compensate for them?",,,"Praise be to Allah.As far as the five daily prayers are concerned, the preferred opinion is that the repetition or compensation (or what is known as qadha in Arabic), is not obligatory for the reason that prayers are obligatory at a particular time, and once that time has elapsed, there is no way to offer them. However, one should seek Allah's forgiveness and offer as many nawafil (voluntary prayers) as possible.
As for fasting-yes; if a person was a Muslim at the time they became obligatory and he did not fast, then their performance is required, accompanied by the feeding of a poor Muslim for every day of fastng that was not observed during previous years. What is required is always a day for a day-no more, no less.
Example 1: A person did not fast three days of Ramadan in the year 1400 A.H., and five days of Ramadan in the year 1401 A.H., all out of negligence. He must now fast eight days, and feed eight poor Muslims in compensation.
Example 2: A girl reached puberty in Ramadan of the year 1400 A.H. but out of shame and modesty did not inform anyone of her menstruation, and, rather, continued fasting say for eight days of her period. Thereafter, she repented. She would then be required to redo eight days of fasting.
It may also be pointed out here that this is the predominant position. A minority opinion is that the ruling for fasting is the same as that for the prayers, i.e., there is no qadha (making up) for fasting in the case of a person who did not fast and did not have a valid reason for not fasting.
As for he who did not offer the obligatory zakah, it is necessary for the repentant to pay it for all previous unpaid years, for it is, from one angle, Allah's right, while from another, the poor people's right. (See Madarij Al-Salikin for further details).

96,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/96,Repentance from One Type of Sin While Committing Another,Is repentance from a particular sin acceptable while I am a victim of another?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, repentance from a particular sin is acceptable even if the repentant insists on another sin which is of a different nature and not the same as the one from which he has repented. For example, if a man repents from having accepted interest but not from drinking wine, his repentance over accepting interest is acceptable, and vice versa. But if he repents from simple interest but not compound interest then his repentance is invalid. Or if he repents from taking drugs but insists on drinking wine, or vice versa, then the repentance is invalid too. It will also be incorrect and unacceptable if a man repents from adultery with one woman but commits it with another. In all of these cases they have only shifted from one variety of sin to another within the same kind.

98,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/98,Returning stolen money when owner not reachable,"I stole from certain people. Now I have repented, but I do not know where 
they live. Perhaps another may say,"" I embezzled some money from a firm 
which has closed up its business."" Or yet another person may say,"" I 
pilfered some material from an establishment which has shifted its 
premises."" What shall I do now?",,,"Praise be to Allah.In all these cases it is incumbent upon you to search for them to the extent of your 
means. If you find them, return them their right. If the owner or owners have died, then 
their right should be returned to their immediate kin. However, if you cannot locate 
them, then spend in charity equal amounts on their behalf. Allah will give them the 
reward of this charity. And if they are unbelievers, Allah will compensate them in some 
way or other in this world itself, since there are no rewards for the unbelievers in the 
Hereafter. 
This is similar to the story that Ibn ul-Qayyim has written in his Madarij Al-Salikin 
(1/388). He states that a soldier of a Muslim regiment ghalla [i.e., stole from 
al-ghaneema (the war spoils)]. Then, after some time, he repented and took with him 
what he had stolen and reported to the commander of the regiment. But the commander 
refused to accept it back saying, 'And how do I return this to the soldiers [seeing that 
they have dispersed].' The man then went to a scholar - Hajjaj bin al-Sha'ir [seeking 
his advice]. He [Hajjaj] told him: 'Listen! Allah knows the army involved and each 
soldier's name and lineage. Send one fifth of the amount to the one whose right is 
one-fifth (this is in reference to bait ul-maal, or the central depository in the Islamic 
government which contains money to be spent in charity, and which receives one-fifth 
of all spoils of war), and spend the rest in charity in their name and Allah will give 
convey it to them.' The man did so. And when the news reached Mu'awiyya bin Sufyan 
[who was then the khalifa], he said: 'That I had been the man who gave that ruling, is 
dearer to me than half of what I rule over.' Imam Ibn Taymiyya has also given a similar 
ruling. (See Madarij)","Excerpts from the book ""I would like to repent BUT..."""
99,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/99,Repentance From Backbiting and Informing Victim,"I have committed backbiting involving a person or a group of people, or have unjustly slandered some people regarding things with which they didn't have anything to do. Is it a condition of repentance that I should inform them and seek their pardon? And if this is not required then how do I repent?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The answer will depend on 
    the nature of the interests of the people involved. If the case is such that 
    if he were to inform them of what he had once said about them, it would not 
    be likely to increase their anger, then, he should do that and seek their 
    forgiveness. He may then tell them - in general terms, and without offering 
    details - that he had wronged them in the past by expressing such sentiments 
    about them that were not right and just, and that now he has repented and 
    seeks their forgiveness. 
But if the case is the 
    opposite, that is, the fear is that if he told them of the previous 
    backbiting or slander, they will - and in most cases that is most likely to 
    happen - be angry with him, or will not be satisfied with the general terms, 
    rather, will demand to know all the details, which is sure to provoke them 
    to anger, then, in such a case, it is not obligatory on him to let them know 
    and seek their forgiveness for the sharee'ah (Islamic law) does not order 
    adding insult to injury. And informing a person who was in a happy mood, of 
    things that will evoke feelings of distress or anger, is something against 
    the purpose of the sharee'ah, which enjoins the spread of happiness and 
    brotherliness. In fact, sometimes such action may give place to animosity 
    where there was love. In such situations it is enough to repent in the 
    following manner. 

    Evoke 
    in oneself the feeling of regret, and seek forgiveness from Allah 
    accompanied by the conviction that it was an abominable and unlawful thing 
    in which he had indulged. Try and make up for what he had said earlier 
    before others by denying the presence of things and qualities he had alleged 
    were in them and clear the person or persons involved. Follow up by 
    mentioning and asserting good qualities of those he had spoken ill of in the 
    presence of the same people in whose company he had slandered them. Defend 
    the people he had slandered when they are slandered in his presence. Pray to 
    Allah in private to forgive the sins and shortcomings of those he had 
    wronged. (See Madarij Al-Salikin, and Al-Mughni with explanatory notes for 
    further elucidation). 
You must note, dear 
    brother Muslim or sister Muslimah, that there is a difference between the 
    material rights of the people and non-material rights, between backbiting 
    and defamation. When the material rights are returned to the people, they 
    are put to some use and cause increase in happiness, and therefore they must 
    not be put under the mattress. Whereas non-material rights, such as those 
    concerning a man's honor, when returned to the people can only cause 
    increase in distress.
