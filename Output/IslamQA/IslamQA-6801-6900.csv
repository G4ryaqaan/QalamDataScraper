6830,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6830,He wants to do Hajj first and his father wants him to get married first,"Will I be disobeying my father because of the following? 

1.  My father (may Allah have mercy on him) wanted me to start looking to get married, but I refused because I wanted to complete my postgraduate studies.

2.  The money that I saved was sufficient to get married (the marriage contract only). Please note that I have a job.

3.  Then I was not able to travel in order to complete my postgraduate studies, so I decided to start a small business in the hope that I could earn some money with which to do Hajj. This project was a partnership between me and him; it was a piece of land (the price of which was not enough to do Hajj). We were planning to change the house in which we live because of the annoyance caused by the neighbours, may Allah guide them.

4.  My father refused to do Hajj  with this money because he said that it was my money, not his.

5.  After a discussion which did not lead anywhere, I said: I am going to do Hajj, but he told me to get married first.

6. Now – after he died in Ramadan – they are asking me to do what he wanted me to do, but I am telling them that I want to do Hajj first.

7. The land is now yielding enough money to perform the obligatory Hajj; he and I paid off the debt (the price of the land) before he died.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    Hajj is obligatory and should be done at the earliest 
    opportunity according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions. 
    This has been discussed in the answer to question no.
    41702. 

    If the available money is sufficient for either doing Hajj or 
    getting married, then precedence should be given to marriage if there is a 
    need for that and there is the fear of falling into haraam. If there is no 
    (urgent) need for marriage, then Hajj should be given precedence. 

    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in 
    al-Mughni (5/12): If (the individual) needs to get married and fears 
    that he may encounter hardship, then he should give precedence to marriage, 
    because it is obligatory in his case and he cannot do without it, so it is 
    like spending on his maintenance. If there is no such fear, he should give 
    precedence to Hajj, because marriage is voluntary and should not be given 
    precedence over the obligatory Hajj. End quote. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was 
    asked: Is it permissible to delay Hajj until after getting married for one 
    who is able to do it? That is because of what the youth are facing nowadays 
    of temptation, both great and small. 

    He replied: 

    There is no doubt that marriage, for one who has the desire 
    and urgent need for it, takes precedence over Hajj, because if an individual 
    has overwhelming desire, in that case marriage becomes one of the 
    necessities of life, like eating and drinking. Hence it is permissible for 
    one who needs to get married and does not have any money to be given zakaah 
    funds with which to get married, just as the poor person may be given food 
    to suffice him and clothes with which to cover his ‘awrah out of the zakaah 
    funds. 

    Based on that, we say: if he needs to get married, then he 
    should give marriage precedence over Hajj, because Allah, may He be 
    glorified and exalted, stipulated that in order for Hajj to be obligatory, 
    one must be able to do it, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):

    “And Hajj 
    (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to 
    Allah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision 
    and residence)”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:97].

    In the case of one who is young and it does not matter for 
    him whether he gets married this year or next year, then he should give 
    precedence to Hajj because it is not necessary for him to give precedence to 
    marriage.

    End quote from Fataawa Manaar al-Islam, 2/375 

    Based on that, if you do not have any fears (of falling into 
    haraam) if you delay marriage, then you should hasten to do Hajj first, and 
    Allah will compensate you with good, because Hajj is one of the important 
    obligatory duties and rituals of Islam. 

    You do not have to carry out your father’s wishes with regard 
    to this matter, either during his lifetime or after his death, because that 
    would result in your delaying Hajj when there is no need to do so. 

    Secondly: 

    You should have tried to please your father by giving 
    precedence to marriage over completing your postgraduate studies. It was 
    narrated from Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) that marriage is 
    obligatory if either of the parents tell you to get married. 

    Al-Mirdaawi said: Is it (marriage) obligatory if the parents, 
    or one of them, tell the son to get married? Imam Ahmad (may Allah have 
    mercy on him) said: If he has parents who are telling him to get married, 
    then I tell him to get married. Or if he is a young man who fears that he 
    may commit sin, I tell him to get married. 

    By saying this, he made the parents’ instructions to get 
    married equivalent to fearing that one may commit sin.

    End quote from al-Insaaf, 8/14 

    Thirdly: 

    There is nothing wrong with a father doing Hajj with his 
    son’s wealth; in fact there is nothing wrong with a person doing Hajj with 
    another person’s wealth in general. But if a person was not able to do the 
    obligatory Hajj because he could not afford the expenses, then he became 
    able to afford it if someone else pays for it, does he have to accept this 
    money in order to do Hajj? There is a difference of opinion among the 
    fuqaha’ concerning that. 

    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: He is not 
    obliged to do Hajj if someone else spends on it, and he does not become able 
    to do it thereby (and thus it does not become obligatory for him), whether 
    the one who gives him the money is a relative or otherwise, and whether he 
    gives him a means of transportation and provisions, or he gives him money. 
    However, it was narrated from ash-Shaafa‘i that if a person’s son gives him 
    money that enables him to do Hajj, then he is obliged to do it, because he 
    has enabled him to do Hajj without feeling that he owes a favour to anyone, 
    and no harm or annoyance will result from that. Therefore he is obliged to 
    do Hajj, as would be the case if he possessed sufficient provisions and a 
    mount. 

    In our view, the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of 
    Allah be upon him) make Hajj binding on one who has a means of 
    transportation and sufficient funds to cover the costs of the journey. 
    However, in the case where someone else offers to over these costs, he is 
    not regarded as having the means or the money to obtain the means, so Hajj 
    is not obligatory for him. The same applies if his father offers to help 
    him, because we do not think that the father will not feel that he owes him 
    a favour in this case. 

    End quote from al-Mughni, 3/87 

    To sum up: it is obligatory for you to hasten to do Hajj, so 
    long as you do not think that you will fall into haraam as a result of 
    delaying marriage, and you should ask Allah, may He be exalted, for 
    forgiveness for having gone against your father’s instructions when he told 
    you to get married first. 

    We ask Allah to help and guide you.

6831,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6831,What Are the Benefits of Zamzam Water?,What are the benefits of Zamzam water?,"Allah provided water for Prophet Isma`il and his mother with Zamzam water. The heart of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) was washed with Zamzam water. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) drank it, did wudu with it and poured it on his head.",,"Praise be to Allah.The water of Zamzam is water of great virtue which first sprang forth when Jibril (peace be upon him) struck (the earth) with his wing (Sahih al-Bukhari, 3364). Allah provided water for Isma’il (peace be upon him) and his mother with it . 
The heart of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was washed with Zamzam water. Many sahih hadiths have been narrated concerning its virtues, such as:
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best water on the face of the earth is the water of Zamzam; it is a kind of food and a healing from sickness.” (Sahih al-Jami’, 3302)
It was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) drank it , did wudu with it and poured it on his head. He used to carry Zamzam water in small vessels and large containers in order to pour it on the sick and give it to them to drink. (Al-Silsilat al-Sahihah, 883)
One of the Companions said: we used to call it al-Shabba’ah (satisfying) and it helped us to take care of our families (i.e., it was filling and helped them to do without food, it was also sufficient to nourish children). (Al-Silsilat al-Sahihah li’l-Albani, 2685)
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The water of Zamzam is for whatever it is drunk for.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 3062; this is a hasan hadith. Scholars and righteous people have experienced this – they have drunk it with the intention of fulfilling some need such as healing from sickness or being freed from poverty and distress, and Allah fulfilled these hopes).

      about the mark on a person’s forehead caused by sujood?","When a person prays salah,usaually his forehead gets darker because of sajda and people know that he prays. 

Because of this,this person can feel proud and may be some times he likes people to talk positive about him and say good remarks about him because of 
his prayers. 

Is it O.K. or better in this case for this person to do sajda very lightly and softly or what do you suggest.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Prophet 
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded us to do rukoo’
      and sujood perfectly and completely.
 It was reported
      from Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he heard the
      Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do your
      rukoo’ and sujood perfectly and completely, for by the One in Whose Hand
      is my soul, I can see you behind me when you do rukoo’ and sujood.” (Narrated
      by al-Bukhaari, 6268; Muslim, 425)
 Part of doing
      rukoo’ and sujood properly and correctly is to be at ease in both.
 It was reported
      from Abu Hurayrah that a man entered the mosque and prayed. The Messenger
      of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was sitting in
      a corner of the mosque, and the man came and greeted him with salaam. The
      Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) answered “Wa
      ‘alayk (and also upon you). Go back and pray, for you have not
      prayed.” So he went back and prayed, then he came and greeted the
      Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with salaam, and
      the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) answered
      “Wa ‘alayk (and also upon you). Go back and pray, for you have not
      prayed yet.” The third time this happened, the man said, “Teach me, O
      Messenger of Allaah.” He said: “When you stand up to pray, do wudoo’
      properly, then face the qiblah and say ‘Allaahu akbar.’ Then recite
      whatever you can of Qur’aan. Then do rukoo’ until you are at ease in
      rukoo’. Then stand up until you are at ease in standing, then do sujood
      until you are at ease in sujood. Then sit up until you are sitting up
      straight. Do that throughout your prayer.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 724; Muslim, 397).
Not doing rukoo’ and sujood properly and completely is something which
      invalidates one's prayer.
 It was reported
      that Abu Mas’ood al-Ansaari al-Badri said: “The Messenger of Allaah
       (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘A prayer in
      which a person does not straighten his spine in his rukoo’ and sujood
      does not count.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 265; he said it is
      hasan saheeh. Also narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 1027; Abu Dawood, 855; Ibn
      Maajah, 870) 
Imaam al-Tirmidhi
      said:
 “Prayer
      should be done in accordance with this, according to the scholars among
      the Companions of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
      him) and later scholars, who said that a man should straighten his spine
      when he does rukoo’ and sujood.” 
Al-Shaafa'i, Ahmad
      and Ishaaq said: “A prayer in which a person does not straighten his
      spine in his rukoo’ and sujood does not count, because of the hadeeth of
      the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): ‘A prayer
      in which a person does not straighten his spine in his rukoo’ and sujood
      does not count.’” (Sunan
      al-Tirmidhi, 2/52)
 It was reported
      from Abu Waa’il that Hudhayfah saw a man who was not doing rukoo’ and
      sujood perfectly and completely. When he finished praying, Hudhayfah said
      to him, “You have not prayed.” He (the narrator) said: “I think he
      said, ‘If you were to die now, you would die on something other than the
      Sunnah of Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).’”
      (Narrated
      by al-Bukhaari, 382).
 According to
      another report (758): it was reported that Zayd ibn Wahb said:
      “Hudhayfah saw a man who was not doing rukoo’ and sujood perfectly and
      completely. He said, ‘You have not prayed. If you were to die now, you
      would die on something other than the fitrah to which Allaah guided
      Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).’”
 It is essential
      to place the forehead and nose firmly on the ground when making sujood.
 It was reported
      that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: “The
      Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘I was
      commanded to prostrate on seven bones: the forehead’ – and he pointed
      to his nose – ‘the two hands, the two knees and the toes. And do not
      tie up your clothes or hair.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 779; Muslim, 490).
There is nothing wrong with making the sujood long, especially when
      praying alone, or in Salaat al-Kusoof (eclipse prayer) or in qiyaam
      al-layl (naafil prayers at night).
 It was reported
      from Asmaa’ bint Abi Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with her)
      that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed
      Salaat al-Kusoof (eclipse prayer). He stood and made his standing lengthy;
      then he did rukoo’ and made his rukoo’ lengthy; then he stood up and
      made his standing lengthy; then he did rukoo’ and made his rukoo’
      lengthy; then he stood up and did sujood, then he sat up and did sujood
      again, and made his sujood lengthy. Then he stood up and made his standing
      lengthy; then he did rukoo’ and made his rukoo’ lengthy; then he stood
      up and made his standing lengthy; then he did rukoo’ and made his
      rukoo’ lengthy; then he stood up and did sujood, and made his sujood
      lengthy; then he sat up and did sujood again, and made his sujood lengthy,
      then he finished.” (Narrated by
      al-Bukhaari, 812).
 It was reported
      that Hudhayfah said: “I prayed with the Prophet  (peace and
      blessings of Allaah be upon him) one night. He started to recite
      al-Baqarah, and I thought that he would do rukoo’ after one hundred
      aayaat, but he carried on. I thought that he would finish it and then do
      rukoo’, but he carried on. Then he started to recite al-Nisaa’ and he
      recited it all, then he started to recite Aal ‘Imraan, and he recited it
      all, at a steady and moderate pace. If he recited an aayah which mentioned
      tasbeeh (glorifying Allaah), he would glorify Allaah; if he recited an
      aayah which mentioned asking, he would ask Allaah; if he recited an aayah
      which mentioned seeking refuge with Allaah, he would seek refuge with Him.
      Then he did rukoo’ and started saying ‘Subhaan
      Rabbi al-al’Azeem,’ and his rukoo’ was almost as long as
      his standing. Then he said, ‘Sami’a
      Allaahu li man hamidah’ and stood up, and his standing was
      almost as long as his rukoo’. Then he prostrated and said, ‘Subhaana
      Rabbi al-A’laa’, and his sujood was almost as long as his
      standing.” (Narrated by Muslim,
      772)
 The Sunnah in
      sujood is to be level in sujood, as it was narrated from Anas that the
      Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “be level
      in sujood, and none of you should spread his forearms as a dog spreads
      them.” (Narrated
      by al-Bukhaari, 788; Muslim, 493).
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah preserve him) said:
 This means that
      you should do sujood in a level way, not bunched up tight so that the
      stomach rests on the thighs and the thighs on the calves, and not
      stretched out as some people do when they prostrate, so that they are
      almost lying on their fronts. Undoubtedly this is a kind of bid’ah and
      is not Sunnah. It was not narrated from the Prophet  (peace and
      blessings of Allaah be upon him) or from any of the Sahaabah, as far as we
      know, that a person should stretch out his back in sujood. He should
      stretch his back in rukoo’, but in sujood he should raise his stomach
      and not stretch it out.” (al-Sharh
      al-Mumti’, 3/168).
 If a person
      does as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
      commanded, and he is prostrating on soil or a rough surface, then he may
      get a mark on his forehead. This may generate some pride in his heart, as
      mentioned in the question, but if a person’s heart is filled with
      sincere faith and he does what he does only for the purpose of seeking
      that which is with Allaah, then he will not care what people say about
      him. But if he deliberately tries to make a mark on his forehead that
      looks like the sign of sujood, then this is a kind of showing off and
      lying, so woe to him of the punishment of a painful Day!
 With regard to
      the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“… You see them bowing and falling down
      prostrate (in prayer), seeking Bounty from Allaah and (His) Good Pleasure.
      The mark of them (i.e. of their Faith) is on their faces (foreheads) from
      the traces of prostration (during prayers)….” [al-Fath 48:29]
 -- the correct meaning of the phrase “the
      mark of them is on their faces” is that this refers to the
      light of obedience and worship, and it does not necessarily mean that
      there is a physical mark on the skin in the place of prostration.
 Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on
      him) said in his Tafseer of
      this aayah:
 “… ‘the
      mark of them is on their faces from the traces of prostration’
      -‘Ali ibn Abi Talhah said,
      narratingfrom Ibn ‘Abbaas
      (may Allaah be pleased with them): ‘the
      mark of them is on their faces’ means their outward
      appearance. Mujaahid and others said that it means khushoo’ and
      humility. Ibn Abi Haatim said: my father told us, ‘Ali ibn Muhammad
      al-Tanaafusi told us, Husayn al-Ja’fi told us, from Zaa’idah from
      Mansoor from Mujaahid: ‘the mark of
      them is on their faces from the traces of prostration’ – he
      said: (this means) khushoo’ (humility). I said, I always thought that it
      meant this mark on the face. He said, That may appear between the eyes of
      one whose heart is harder than Pharaoh’s. Al-Saddi said: Prayer makes
      their faces beautiful. One of the Salaf said; Whoever prays more at night,
      his face becomes more handsome by day… Some of them said that a hasanah
      (good deeds) brings light (noor) to the heart and a glow to the face, an
      increased provision and the love of the people.”
 The point is, the fact that this mark is
      present on the skin and there is a change in the colour of the forehead,
      does not mean that a person is righteous and sincere. By the same token,
      if this mark is absent, that does not mean that a person is failing in his
      prayers. In many cases it has to do with the nature and sensitivity of an
      individual’s skin.
 Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah
      preserve him) was asked: is there any report to indicate that the mark on
      the forehead caused by sujood is a sign of the righteous?
 He replied:
 This is not one of the signs of the
      righteous; the sign is the light (noor ) which appears on the face, and
      being content and at peace, a good attitude, and the like.
 As for the mark made by sujood on the
      face, it may appear on the faces of people who do not even pray the
      obligatory prayers, if their skin is very soft and sensitive, and it may
      not appear of the faces of people who pray a lot and make lengthy sujood.
(Fataawaa
      Islamiyyah, 1/484)
In
      conclusion, then, if you are sincere towards Allaah and seek to earn His
      pleasure when you pray, then what people say will not affect you; in fact,
      their praise of you may be a kind of hastening of glad tidings for you in
      this world. So follow the Sunnah and do sujood properly, and then do not
      worry about whether people praise you or condemn you. We ask Allaah to
      make you sincere and to accept your prayers.

6846,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6846,Interacting With Jinn,"My husband has told me that in his country, many people including Shaykhs have gone to talk with the jinn. He told me that when someone has an ailment they go to the jinn for help. I have told my husband that I believe that this is haram (impermissible), but he says that it is halal (permissible) because the Shaykhs do that. Could you please give me some evidence (daleel) about this matter?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    
    1 – Seeking the help of the jinn or turning to them to 
    fulfill one’s desires to cause harm or bring benefit is shirk or associating 
    others in worship with Allah, because it is a kind of mutual benefitting 
    whereby the jinn responds to the human’s requests and fulfills his needs in 
    return for the human’s veneration of the jinn, turning to him and asking for 
    his help to do what he wants.

    
    Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“And on the Day when He will gather them 
    (all) together (and say): ‘O you assembly of jinn! Many did you mislead of 
    men,’ and their awliya (friends and helpers) amongst men will say: ‘Our 
    Lord! We benefited one from the other, but now we have reached our appointed 
    term which You did appoint for us.’ He will say: ‘The Fire be your dwelling 
    place, you will dwell therein forever, except as Allah may will. Certainly 
    your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.’

    
    And thus We do make the Zaalimun (polytheists and wrongdoers) 
    awliya (supporters and helpers) of one another (in committing crimes), 
    because of that which they used to earn.” [6:128]

    
    “And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter 
    with the males among the jinn, but they (jinn) increased them (mankind) in 
    sin and transgression.” [72:6]

    
    If a human seeks the help of a jinn to cause harm to another 
    person, or seeks his help for protection from the evil of a person whose 
    evil he fears, all of this is shirk.

    
    Whoever is like this, his prayer and his fasting are both 
    invalid, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

    
     “If you join others in worship with Allah, (then) surely, 
    (all) your deeds will be in vain, and you will certainly be among the 
    losers.”

    
    [39:65]

    
    If a person is known for doing this, then the funeral prayer 
    is not to be offered for him if he dies, his funeral is not to be attended, 
    and he is not to be buried in the Muslim graveyard. 

    
    2 – The Standing Committee was asked a similar question, 
    which said: 

    
    I would like to inform you that in Zambia there is a Muslim 
    man who claims that he has jinn with him, and the people go to him and ask 
    him to heal their diseases, and this jinn prescribes medicine for them. Is 
    this permissible? 

    
    The answer is:

    
    It is not permissible for this man to use the services of the 
    jinn, and it is not permissible for the people to go to him, seeking 
    treatment for their diseases through advice from the jinn, or to fulfill any 
    needs in this manner.

    
    Treating disease by means of human doctors and by using 
    permissible medicines means that there is no need for that. This should be 
    enough to free us from the control of these charlatans.

    
    It was narrated in a saheeh hadeeth (authentic narration) 
    that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever 
    goes to a fortune-teller and asks him about something, his prayers will not 
    be accepted for forty days.” [Muslim]

    
    The four authors of al-Sunan, and al-Hakim in a saheeh 
    hadeeth, narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon 
    him) said: “Whoever goes to a fortuneteller and believes what he said has 
    disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad.”

    
    This man and his companions from among the jinn are to be 
    regarded as fortunetellers and soothsayers. It is not permissible to ask 
    them anything or to believe them.

    Riba (usury, interest) is one of the things that are 
    definitively forbidden in Islamic sharee’ah. 

    1 – Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Allaah has permitted trading and forbidden Ribaa. So 
    whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating Ribaa, shall 
    not be punished for the past; his case is for Allaah (to judge); but whoever 
    returns (to Ribaa), such are the dwellers of the Fire — they will abide 
    therein”

    [al-Baqarah 2:275]

    2 – And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

     “O you who believe! Fear Allaah and give up what remains 
    (due to you) from Ribaa (from now onward) if you are (really) believers”

    [al-Baqarah 2:278]

    3 – It was narrated that ‘Awn ibn Abi Juhayfah said: “I saw 
    my father buying a slave whose profession was cupping, and he ordered that 
    his tools be broken. I asked him about that and he said that the Messenger 
    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade the price 
    of blood, the price of a dog and the earnings of a prostitute; he cursed the 
    woman who does tattooing and the one who asks for it to be done, and the one 
    who consumes riba and the one who pays it, and he cursed the one who makes 
    images.” 

    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2123). 

    It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) cursed those who consume riba and those who pay it.

    (Narrated by Muslim, 1597). 

    4 – It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “”Avoid the seven things that doom a person to Hell.” They said, “O 
    Messenger of Allaah, what are they?” He said, “Associating others with 
    Allaah (shirk); witchcraft (sihr); killing a soul whom Allaah has forbidden 
    to kill, except for a lawful reason; consuming riba; consuming the property 
    of orphans; fleeing from the battlefield; and slandering chaste and innocent 
    believing women.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2615; Muslim, 89). 

    5 – It was narrated that Samurah ibn Jundub said: The Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Tonight I saw (in a 
    dream) two men who came to me and took me out to a holy land. We went on 
    until we came to a river of blood, in which a man was standing, and on the 
    riverbank there was a man with stones in front of him. The man who was in 
    the river came forward, and when he wanted to climb out, the other man threw 
    a stone in his mouth and sent him back to where he came from. He did that 
    every time the man wanted to come out, throwing a stone into his mouth to 
    make him go back. I said, ‘What is this?’ They said, ‘The one who you saw in 
    the river is the one who consumed riba.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1979) 

    There is unanimous agreement (among the scholars) that riba 
    is haraam, and credit cards come under the heading of riba. See questions 
    no. 11179 and 
    5540. 

    Hence we do not think that we can offer the questioner any 
    better advice than the advice of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him), which is to fast so that he can calm himself down and 
    to get used to worship, and to make it difficult for the Shaytaan to find 
    any way to influence him. 

    It was narrated that Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said 
    to us: “O young men, whoever among you can afford to get married, let him do 
    so, and whoever cannot do that, then let him fast, for it will be a shield 
    for him.”

    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4778; Muslim, 1400) 

    A shield means that it will protect him from falling into 
    sin.

I always feel uncomfortable with the way I am living From time to time I get this feeling of discomfort, that "" Where is my place in the hereafter? I don't feel happy about anything good in my life because of this feeling of mine. I always regret when I miss my prayers.I feel like doing a lot of good things as Allah wants me to do, so that I will get in to paradise with Prophet Muhammad (p.b.u.h),but I end up doing nothing.. I want to learn Islam for myself and dedicate my life for it. What I request you is steps to start",,,"Praise be to Allah.These feelings that you mention in your question stem from good motives, in sha Allaah, and result from your
feelings that you are falling short and want to purify yourself and raise your
level of  spiritually. But it is important
not to let them lead you to despair; they should motivate you to improve
yourself. Make the most of these feelings of shortcoming to push you to strive;
don’t let them make you sink to a lower level or be content with the status quo
and not try to change.  
 The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah
be upon him) used to seek refuge with Allaah in his du’aa’s (supplications)  from feeling helpless
and laziness, and he taught us to strive to do things which will benefit us in
this world and in the Hereafter. He told us: “Strive to do that which will
benefit you, and seek the help of Allaah, and do not
feel helpless.” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 4816). Always
be conscious of Allaah, because Allaah
says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“O you who believe! Fear Allaah (by doing all that He has
ordered and by abstaining from all that He has forbidden) as He should be
feared. (Obey Him, be thankful to Him, and remember Him always,) and die
not except in a state of Islam [as Muslims (with complete submission to Allaah)].” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:102]  
 Remember His promise and warning, for He has promised His righteous
close friends forgiveness and a great reward:  
“Allaah has promised those who believe (in the
Oneness of Allaah — Islamic Monotheism) and do deeds
of righteousness, that for them there is forgiveness and a great reward (i.e.
Paradise)” [al-Maa’idah 5:9 – interpretation of the
meaning]  
 And He has issued a warning to those who stray from the straight path
and who disobey His commands:  
“Allaah has promised the hypocrites — men and
women — and the disbelievers, the fire of Hell” [al-Tawbah
9:68 – interpretation of the meaning].  
 This is so that people will always remain in a state between fear and
hope, and so that they will know that the promise of Allaah
is true and they will not get carried away with this life, but will prepare
themselves for the Meeting with Him.  
 “O mankind! Verily, the Promise of Allaah is
true. So let not this present life deceive you, and
let not the chief deceiver (Satan) deceive you about Allaah”
[Faatir 35:5 – interpretation of the meaning]  
 Remember Allaah much, for this will bring
peace of mind and grant rest to the heart.  
“Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allaah —
Islamic Monotheism), and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allaah verily, in the remembrance of Allaah
do hearts find rest” [al-Ra’d 13:28 – interpretation
of the meaning]  
 You must seek forgiveness for the commandments of Allaah
that you have failed to obey, for Allaah has made the
gate of repentance open to every sinner. Muslim narrated in al-Saheeh that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah
spreads out His hand at night to accept the repentance of those who have sinned
during the day, and He spreads out His hand during the day to accept the
repentance of those who sinned at night, (and this will continue) until the sun
rises from the west.” (Saheeh Muslim, 4954)  
 It was also reported that he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah
says, ‘O son of Adam, so long as you call on Me and put your hope in Me, I will
forgive whatever you have done, and I will not mind. O son of Adam, even if
your sins were to reach the clouds of the sky, then you were to seek My forgiveness, I would forgive you and I will not mind. O
son of Adam, if you were to come to me with an earthful
of sins, and you were to meet Me not associating anything in worship with Me, I
will come to you with an earthful of forgiveness.’” (narrated by al-Tirmidhi with a hasan isnaad (sound chain).
Sunan al-Tirmidhi, no. 3463). If a Muslim strives to obey Allaah, Allaah will make for him
a way out from every difficulty. Allaah says
(interpretation of the meaning):  
“And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to
Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will
provide him from (sources) he never could imagine” [al-Talaaq
65:2-3]  
 Always  adhere to the obligatory duties and
keep away from haram (impermissible)
things, then turn your attention to things that are mustahabb
(desirable) 
and strive to do more of them, little by little, so that you will
not feel put off or bored.  
 Finally, beware of procrastination, for it will prevent you from doing
good deeds. If you start to do something, then hasten to do it and do not slow
down or neglect it. Hastening to do such things is a praiseworthy action:  
“And march forth in the way (which leads to) forgiveness from your Lord…” [Aal ‘Imraan
3:133 – interpretation of the meaning]. If you start to do something,
then stick to it, even if it is only a little, for the most beloved of deeds to
Allaah are those that are continuous, even if they
are little.

      said: “The Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be

      man, and none of his skin was ever seen because he was so modest. So some
      of the Children of Israel annoyed him by saying, ‘He is only being so
      modest because he has some fault in his skin, such as leprosy, scrotal
      hernia, etc.’ Allaah wanted to demonstrate that he was free of what they
      were saying about him. One day Moosa went away by himself, put his garment
      on a rock and washed himself. When he had finished, he went to pick up his
      garment, and the rock ran away with it. Moosa picked up his stick and ran
      after the rock, saying, ‘My garment, O rock! My garment, O rock!’ Then
      he reached a group of the Children of Israel, who saw him naked and that
      he was the best that Allaah had created and the most free of the faults
      that they had spoken of. Then the rock stopped, so Moosa took his garment
      and struck the rock with his stick. By Allaah, there were marks left on
      the rock by his stick, three or four or five. This is what Allaah said
      (interpretation of the meaning): ‘O
      you who believe! Be not like those who annoyed Moosa (Moses), but Allaah
      cleared him of that which they alleged, and he was honourable before
      Allaah’ [al-Ahzaab 33:69].”
(Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 3404)
The scholars quoted this hadeeth as evidence that it
      is permissible to be naked when one is alone, especially if that is for a
      reason such as taking a bath. Most of the scholars regarded this as being
      permissible, as al-Haafiz said in al-Fath
      (1/385). Al-Bukhaari gave this chapter the title “Chapter on one who
      bathes naked when he is alone, although whoever covers himself, covering
      is preferable.” The fact that covering oneself is preferable is taken
      from the hadeeth which was narrated by the authors of Sunan
      and classed as hasan by
      al-Tirmidhi and as saheeh by
      al-Haakim, from Mu’aawiyah ibn Haydah, who said: “I said, ‘O Prophet
      of Allaah, when should we cover our ‘awrah and when may we uncover
      it?’ He said, ‘Protect (cover) your ‘awrah from everyone except your
      wife and those whom your right hand possesses (concubines).’ I said,
      ‘O Messenger of Allaah, what about when one of us is alone?’ He said,

    Day of Resurrection among the fuqaha (jurists) and scholars,” and “… Allah

    was narrated by Ibn al-Jawzi in al-‘Ilal al-Mutanahiyah, and he explained 
    that all of these hadeeths are da’eef.  Ibn al-Mundhir discussed it in a

    can convey it to others, for perhaps he is conveying it to one who will 
    understand it better than him, and perhaps the one who conveys knowledge 
    does not understand it himself.”
