The kind of waswas that I have is swearing and cursing, which I say in anger, such as cursing myself or my father or my mother, and sometimes I cannot help it.
I hope that you can tell me the right way to deal with this.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Shaytan is keen to corrupt the Muslim’s worship by means of waswas (insinuating whispers), but the Muslim can ward off these tricks of the Shaytan by seeking refuge in Allah, may He be exalted, from his evil, and learning the rulings of Islam and acquiring knowledge of fiqh (jurisprudence). If he starts to doubt how many rak’ahs he has done during prayer, he should proceed on the basis of the smaller number and do the prostration of forgetfulness before saying the salam. If he is not sure whether he divorced his wife or not, the basic principle is that he did not divorce her. If he is not sure whether there is any impurity (najasah) on his body or clothes or not, the basic principle is that his body and clothes are pure, and so on. 
These rulings apply to cases of doubt that do not stem from waswas. If the doubt is caused by waswas, then he should not pay attention to anything that the Shaytan casts into his mind, and there is no other solution but to seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytan and ignore this waswas, and not pay any attention to it. Similarly, after doing wudu and praying, if he feels uncertain about them, he should not pay any attention to that uncertainty. 
If this waswas is not warded off by seeking refuge with Allah, and it overwhelms the Muslim until he says or does something without realizing, that is compulsive waswas or OCD (al-waswas al-qahri). This is a kind of sickness and he should seek treatment for it by means of ruqyah (recitations) from the Quran and Sunnah as prescribed in Islam, and permissible medicines. There is no reason why he should not go to a Muslim doctor whose religious commitment and knowledge of Islam can be trusted. 
If this person who is affected by waswas experiences physical movements  that he cannot control or he says things that he cannot stop himself saying, then there is no sin on him and he is excused according to Islam, because in that case he has been burdened with something that he cannot bear, so he is excused because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope” (al-Baqarah 2:286) 
“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can”(al-Taghabun 64:16)
In the answer to question no.  10160, we have quoted the words of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him): 
Similarly, if there crosses his mind any thought of impugning Allah (may He be exalted) or impugning the Quran or other kinds of kufr (disbelief), he should not pay any attention to it, and it will not harm him, and even if we assume that he says such things involuntarily, there will be no sin on him.

60311,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60311,What is talbeenah? How can it be used as a remedy?,I hope that you can tell me the method of using talbenah as a remedy as described in Prophetic medicine.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Talbeenah is mentioned in 
    a number of saheeh ahaadeeth, such as the following: 

    (a) 

    It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah, the wife of the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), that if a member of her family 
    died, the women would gather together, then they would depart, except her 
    own relatives and close friends. She would order that a pot of talbeenah be 
    cooked, then some thareed would be made and the talbeenah would be poured 
    over it. Then she would say: Eat some of it, for I heard the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “Talbeenah 
    soothes the heart of the sick person, and it takes away some of the grief.” 
    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5101; Muslim, 2216. 

    (b) 

    It was narrated from her (may Allaah be pleased with her) 
    that she would order that talbeenah be made for the sick and the one who was 
    mourning a death, and she used to say: I heard the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “Talbeenah soothes the 
    heart of the sick and takes away some of the grief.”

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5365; Muslim, 2216 

    It is clear from these two hadeeths that talbeenah is used to 
    treat the sick and to reduce the grief of one who is grieving, soothing his 
    heart and giving him energy. 

    Talbeenah is a broth that is made from two spoonfuls of 
    barley flour with bran, then a cup of water is added to that and it is 
    cooked over a low fire for five minutes. 

    Some people add a spoonful of honey to it. 

    It is called talbeenah because it is like milk (laban) in its 
    whiteness and consistency. 

    Ibn al-Qayyim said: 

    If you want to know the virtue of talbeenah, then think of 
    the virtue of barley water, for it is barley water for them. It is a soup 
    that is made from barley flour with bran. The difference between it and 
    barley water is that the latter is made from whole grains, whereas talbeenah 
    is made from flour, which is more beneficial as the properties of the barley 
    are released through grinding. We have mentioned above that habits have an 
    effect on whether medicines and foods are of benefit. It was the habit of 
    the people to drink barley water made from flour rather than whole grains, 
    which is more nourishing and effective… end quote. 

    Zaad al-Ma’aad, 4/120 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him) said, describing talbeenah: 
It is a kind of food that 
    is made from flour or bran, to which honey may be added. It is so called 
    because it resembles milk in its whiteness and consistency. Its benefit is 
    that it is soft and well-cooked, not hard and raw. End quote. 

    Fath al-Baari, 9/550 

    There is no doubt that barley has many benefits, some of 
    which have been discovered in modern studies, such as: lowering cholesterol, 
    treating the heart, treating depression, treating high blood sugar and high 
    blood pressure, softening the stools and soothing the colon. Studies have 
    also demonstrated the importance of barley in reducing the incidence of 
    colon cancer. 

    Dr. Sahba’ Bunduq said – after noting the benefits mentioned 
    above and discussing them in detail: 

    In this sense, talbeenah is a protection against diseases of 
    the heart and circulatory system, as it protects the arteries from 
    arteriosclerosis – especially the major arteries of the heart. It also 
    protects against angina, reduction of blood supply and cardiac infarction. 

    As for those who have actually been affected by these 
    vascular and cardiac problems, talbeenah, with its health benefits, can play 
    an important role in preventing their symptoms from getting worse. This 
    shows the miraculous nature of the words of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Talbeenah soothes the heart of the sick.”

60314,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60314,Circumcision of girls and some doctors’ criticism thereof,"Nowadays we hear that many doctors denounce the circumcision of girls, and say that it harms them physically and psychologically, and that circumcision is an inherited custom that has no basis is Islam .",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    Circumcision is not an inherited custom as some people claim, 
    rather it is prescribed in Islam and the scholars are unanimously agreed 
    that it is prescribed. Not a single Muslim scholar – as far as we know – has 
    said that circumcision is not prescribed. 

    Their evidence is to be found in the saheeh ahaadeeth of the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), which prove that 
    it is prescribed, for example: 

    1- 

    The hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari (5889) and Muslim (257) 
    from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""The fitrah is five things 
    – or five things are part of the fitrah – circumcision, shaving the pubes, 
    cutting the nails, plucking the armpit hairs, and trimming the moustache."" 

    This hadeeth includes circumcision of both males and 
    females. 

    2-  

    Muslim (349) narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased 
    with her) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said: “When a man sits between the four parts (arms and legs of 
    his wife) and the two circumcised parts meet, then ghusl is obligatory.” 

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    mentioned the two circumcised parts, i.e., the circumcised part of the 
    husband and the circumcised part of the wife, which indicates that a woman 
    may be circumcised just like a man. 

    3- 

    Abu Dawood (5271) narrated from Umm ‘Atiyyah al-Ansaariyyah 
    that a woman used to do circumcisions in Madeenah and the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to her: “Do not go to the 
    extreme in cutting; that is better for the woman and more liked by the 
    husband.” But the scholars differed concerning this hadeeth. Some of them 
    classed it as da’eef (weak) and others classed it as saheeh. It was classed 
    as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. The fact that 
    circumcision for women is prescribed in Islam is confirmed by the ahaadeeth 
    quoted above, not by this disputed hadeeth. But the scholars differed 
    concerning the ruling, and there are three opinions: 

    1 – That it is obligatory for both males and females. This is 
    the view of the Shaafa’is and Hanbalis, and is the view favoured by al-Qaadi 
    Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi among the Maalikis (may Allaah have mercy on them 
    all). 

    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in 
    al-Majmoo’ (1/367): Circumcision is obligatory for both men and women in 
    our view. This is the view of many of the salaf, as was narrated by 
    al-Khattaabi. Among those who regarded it as obligatory is Ahmad… it is the 
    correct view that is well known and was stated by al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him), and the majority stated definitively that it is 
    obligatory for both men and women. end quote. 

    See Fath al-Baari, 10/340; Kishshaaf al-Qinaa’, 
    1/80 

    2 – That circumcision is Sunnah for both males and females. 
    This is the view of the Hanafis and Maalikis, and was narrated in one report 
    from Ahmad. Ibn ‘Aabideen al-Hanafi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in 
    his Haashiyah (6/751): In Kitaab al-Tahaarah of al-Siraaj 
    al-Wahhaaj it says: Know that circumcision is Sunnah in our view – i.e., 
    according to the Hanafis – for men and for women. end quote. 

    See: Mawaahib al-Jaleel, 3/259 

    3 – That circumcision is obligatory for men and is good and 
    mustahabb for women. This is the third view of Imam Ahmad, and it is the 
    view of some Maalikis such as Sahnoon. This view was also favoured by 
    al-Muwaffaq ibn Qudaamah in al-Mughni. 

    See: al-Tamheed, 21/60; al-Mughni, 1/63 

    It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (5/223): 

    Circumcision is one of the Sunnahs of the fitrah, and it is 
    for both males and females, except that is it obligatory for males and 
    Sunnah and good in the case of women. End quote

    Thus it is clear that the fuqaha’ of Islam are agreed that 
    circumcision is prescribed for both males and females, and in fact the 
    majority of them are of the view that it is obligatory for both. No one said 
    that it is not prescribed or that it is makrooh or haraam. 

    Secondly: 

    With regard to the criticism of circumcision by some doctors, 
    and their claim that it is harmful both physically and psychologically, 

    This criticism of theirs is not valid. It is sufficient for 
    us Muslims that something be proven to be from the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), then we will follow it, and we are certain 
    that it is beneficial and not harmful. If it were harmful, Allaah and His 
    Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would not have 
    prescribed it for us. 

    In the answer to question no.
    45528 
    we have mentioned some of the medical benefits of circumcision for women, 
    quoting from some doctors. 

    Thirdly: 

    We would add here the fatwas of some modern scholars who have 
    responded to this war that has been launched against female circumcision on 
    the grounds that it is harmful to health. 

    Shaykh Jaad al-Haqq ‘Ali Jaad al-Haqq, the former Shaykh of 
    al-Azhar, said: 

    Hence the fuqaha’ of all madhhabs are agreed that 
    circumcision for both men and woman is part of the fitrah of Islam and one 
    of the symbols of the faith, and it is something praiseworthy. There is no 
    report from any of the Muslim fuqaha’, according to what we have studied in 
    their books that are available to us, to say that circumcision is forbidden 
    for men or women, or that it is not permissible, or that it is harmful for 
    females, if it is done in the manner that the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught to Umm Habeebah in the report quoted 
    above. 

    Then he said: 

    From the above it is clear that the circumcision of girls – 
    which is the topic under discussion here – is part of the fitrah of Islam, 
    and the way it is to be done is the method that the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained. It is not right to 
    abandon his teachings for the view of anyone else, even if that is a doctor, 
    because medicine is knowledge and knowledge is always developing and 
    changing. End quote. 

    In the fatwa of Shaykh ‘Atiyah Saqar – the former heard of 
    the Fatwa Committee in al-Azhar – it says: 

    The calls which urge the banning of female circumcision are 
    call that go against Islam, because there is no clear text in the Qur’aan or 
    Sunnah and there is no opinion of the fuqaha’ that says that female 
    circumcision is haraam. Female circumcision is either obligatory or 
    recommended. Even though there is a fiqhi principle which says that the 
    decree of a ruler may put an end to a dispute regarding controversial 
    matters, the decree of the ruler in this case cannot be but either of two 
    things: that it is either obligatory or recommended, and it is not correct 
    to issue a decree banning it, so as not to go against sharee’ah which is the 
    principal source of legislation in our land, whose constitution states that 
    Islam is the official religion of the country. It is permissible to issue 
    some legislation that provides guidelines for performing this procedure 
    (female circumcision) in the proper manner in such a way that does not 
    contradict the rulings of sharee’ah.  

    The words of the doctors and others are not definitive. 
    Scientific discoveries are still opening doors every day which change our 
    old perceptions. End quote. 

    In the fatwa of Dar al-Ifta’ al-Misriyyah (6/1986) it 
    says: 

    Thus it is clear that female circumcision is prescribed in 
    Islam, and that it is one of the Sunnahs of the fitrah and it has a good 
    effect of moderating the individual’s behaviour. As for the opinions of 
    doctors who say that female circumcision is harmful, these are individual 
    opinions which are not derived from any agreed scientific basis, and they do 
    not form an established scientific opinion. They acknowledge that the rates 
    of cancer among circumcised men are lower than among those who are not 
    circumcised, and some of these doctors clearly recommend that circumcision 
    should be done by doctors and not these ignorant women, so that the 
    operation will be safe and there will be no negative consequences.  However, 
    medical theories about disease and the way to treat it are not fixed, rather 
    they change with time and with ongoing research. So it is not correct to 
    rely on them when criticizing circumcision which the Wise and All-Knowing 
    Lawgiver has decreed in His wisdom for mankind. Experience has taught us 
    that the wisdom behind some rulings and Sunnahs may be hidden from us. May 
    Allaah help us all to follow the right path. End quote.",Islam Q&A

“O you who believe! Fear Allah, and be with those who are true (in words and deeds)” [Al-Tawbah 9:119]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I urge you to be truthful, for “Truthfulness leads to righteousness and righteousness leads to Paradise. A man will keep speaking the truth and striving to speak the truth until he will be recorded with Allah as a siddeeq (speaker of the truth). Lying leads to immorality and immorality leads to Hellfire. A man will keep telling lies and striving to tell lies until he is recorded with Allah as a liar.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5743; Muslim, 2607, from the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him). 
Reconciling between people is an important issue in Islam, one which brings a great deal of reward. There is also a stern warning against sewing discord between people. Because of the importance of reconciling people in the Muslim society and the seriousness of discord and conflict, Allah has permitted lying in order to reconcile between people and to remove discord and conflict which may have negative consequences for the religious commitment of individuals and communities. 
It was narrated from Abu’l-Darda’ (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Shall I not tell you of something that is better than fasting, prayer and charity?” They said: Yes. He said: “Reconciling between two people, for discord between people is the shaver.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, who said: this is a hasan hadeeth. And it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is the shaver, and I do not say that it shaves hair, rather that it shaves religious commitment.” End quote. 
Whomsoever Allah honours and enables him to reconcile between Muslims, if he needs to tell lies in order to reconcile between them, there is no sin on him for that, and it is not permissible to describe him as a liar, because the matter is serious; it is the matter of shar’i interests which means that in this case, lying is permissible, as it is narrated in al-Saheehayn from the hadeeth of Umm Kalthoom bint ‘Uqbah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “He is not a liar who reconciles between people, conveying good messages and saying good things.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2546; Muslim, 2605 
As for swearing false oaths in order to reconcile between people, it seems that this is permissible. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
What is prescribed for the believers is to use oaths sparingly, even if they are true, because swearing oaths a great deal may cause him to end up lying, and it is known that lying is haram, and if a lie is accompanied by an oath, it is even more haram. But if necessity or shar’i interests dictate that a false oath be sworn, there is no sin in that, because it is proven in the hadeeth of Umm Kalthoom bint ‘Uqbah ibn Abi Mu’eet (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “He is not a liar who reconciles between people, conveying good messages and saying good things.” She said: I did not hear him grant any concession concerning anything that the people say of lies except in three cases: reconciling between people, war, and what a man says to his wife, or a woman says to her husband. Narrate by Muslim in al-Saheeh. 
If a person says in order to reconcile between people, “By Allah, your companions want to reconcile, they want to come to an agreement, they want such and such,” then he goes to the others and says something similar, with good intentions and aiming to bring about a reconciliation, there is no sin in that, because of the hadeeth quoted above. 
Similarly, if he sees someone who wants to kill another person unlawfully, or to wrong him in some other way, and he says, “By Allah he is my brother,” in order to rid him of this wrongdoer who wants to kill him unlawfully or beat him unlawfully, because he knows that if he says that he is his brother, he will leave him alone out of respect for him, then he has to say such a thing in the interests of saving his brother from injustice and wrongdoing. 
To conclude: the basic principle concerning false oaths is that they are haram, except in cases where they will serve a greater purpose than lying, as in the three cases mentioned in the hadeeth quoted above.

    Then when the imam comes out, the angels come in to listen to the reminder 
    (khutbah).” 

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 841; Muslim, 850 

    The scholars differed as to the definition of these hours. 
    There are three opinions. 

    1 – That they start when dawn breaks

    2 – That they start when the sun rises. This is the view of 
    al-Shaafa’i, Ahmad, and others.

    3 – That these ‘hours’ all fall within one period of time, 
    which is after the sun has passed its zenith. This is the view of Maalik, 
    and was favoured by some of the Shaafa’is. 

    The third view is weak, and was refuted by many. 

    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    It is well known that the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) used to go out to offer the Jumu’ah prayer straight 
    after the sun passed its zenith, as do all imams in all regions. That is 
    after the end of the sixth hour, which indicates that the one who comes 
    after the sun has passed its zenith has no share of guidance and virtue, and 
    no reward will be recorded for him at all, because he has come after the 
    scrolls (of the recording angels) have been rolled up. The mention of these 
    hours is intended only to encourage people to come early and attain the 
    reward of being in the first row and waiting for the prayer, and keeping 
    busy with naafil prayers, dhikr and the like. None of that can be achieved 
    by going to the mosque after the sun has passed its zenith, and there is no 
    virtue in doing so, because the call to prayer is given at that time and it 
    is haraam to delay responding to it. End quote. 

    Al-Majmoo’, 4/414 

    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
With regard to the view 
    of Maalik that goes against these reports: it is mustahabb to perform 
    Jumu’ah prayer just after the sun has passed its zenith. The Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray Jumu’ah early, and 
    when the imam comes out the scrolls (of the recording angels) are rolled up, 
    and no reward is written down for the one who comes to Jumu’ah prayer after 
    that, so what virtue can there be in such a person? End quote. 

    Al-Mughni, 2/73 
The correct view is the 
    second one, which says that these hours begin when the sun rises, and the 
    time between sunrise and the second adhaan should be divided into five 
    parts, of which each one is what is meant by the word saa’ah (lit. “hour”) 
    in the hadeeth. 

    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him) was asked: 

    When does the first hour of Friday begin? 

    He replied:

     The hours which were mentioned by the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) are five. He said: “Whoever comes (to 
    the mosque) in the first hour, it is as if he sacrificed a camel. Whoever 
    comes at the second hour, it is as if he sacrificed a cow. Whoever comes at 
    the third hour, it is as if he sacrificed a horned ram. Whoever comes at the 
    fourth hour, it is as if he sacrificed a chicken. Whoever comes at the fifth 
    hour, it is as if he sacrificed an egg. Then when the imam comes out, the 
    angels come in to listen to the reminder (khutbah).” So the time between 
    sunrise and the imam’s arrival is divided into five parts, each of which may 
    be equivalent to what we know as an hour (sixty minutes), or it may be more 
    or less, because time changes. So there are five hours between sunrise and 
    the imam’s arrival for the prayer, starting at sunrise. It was also said 
    that it begins at the break of dawn, but the first view is more correct, 
    because the time before sunrise is the time for Fajr prayer. End quote.

    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “Among the good deeds that will reach a believer after his 
    death are: knowledge which he learned and then spread; a righteous son whom 
    he leaves behind; a copy of the Qur’aan that he leaves as a legacy; a mosque 
    that he built; a house that he built for wayfarers; a canal that he dug; or 
    charity that he gave during his lifetime when he was in good health. These 
    deeds will reach him after his death.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 242; classed 
    as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 77. 

    Secondly: 

    With regard to lending these books, reference should be made 
    to the conditions stipulated by the one who donated them as a waqf. If he 
    gave permission for lending them to those who will benefit from them and 
    then return them, or if he did not stipulate that but it is customary for 
    people to borrow the books that have been donated as a waqf to the mosque, 
    then in these two cases there is nothing wrong with lending them. 

    The one who is responsible for them should document this 
    lending by writing down the name of the borrower and noting the date the 
    book was borrowed and the date for its return. 

    The one who borrows a book has to look after it and guard 
    against any tearing or damage, and not write in it. He must return it on the 
    date stipulated, so that others will also have the opportunity to benefit 
    from it, and the reward for the one who donated it will be increased. 

    But if the donor stipulated that they should not be lent out, 
    or he did not stipulate anything and it is not customary for people to 
    borrow books, then it is not permissible to lend them to anyone, and whoever 
    wants to benefit from them has to read them in the mosque. 

    Thirdly: 

    With regard to disposing of them, the one who is in charge of 
    the waqf should act in accordance with the conditions stipulated by the one 
    who donated the waqf, with regard to lending them or not lending them, and 
    other conditions. 

    It is not permissible for him to let small children or those 
    who are known to be careless and not look after them get hold of them, 
    because that is a betrayal of the trust for which he is responsible.

60351,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60351,Female students kissing one another every day,"What is the ruling on kissing people on the cheek, apart from husband and wife? This phenomenon has become widespread among girls in school, to such an extent that two friends will exchange kisses every morning. I would like to know the Islamic ruling, with evidence, and the ruling on this strange phenomenon in particular.",,,"Praise be to Allah.What is prescribed when meeting is to say salaams and shake hands. If a person has come from a journey then it is prescribed to embrace him. As for kissing at every meeting, this is not part of the Sunnah of greeting, rather it is narrated that this is disallowed. Al-Tirmidhi narrated (2728) that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man said: O Messenger of Allah, when one of us meets his brother or his friend, should he bow to him? He said: No. He said: Should he embrace him and kiss him? He said: No. He said: Should he take his hand and shake hands with him? He said: Yes. This hadith was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi. 
Yes, kissing is prescribed on some occasions, when returning from a journey and the like. See question no. 34497. 
But as for exchanging kisses every morning, there is no doubt that this is not prescribed, and it is a strange phenomenon that is alien to Muslim societies. There is the fear that it may be taken as a means by those in whose hearts is a disease to engage in haraam physical pleasure within the framework of another phenomenon which is called admiration, which is undoubtedly a haraam kind of infatuation. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
As for embracing and kissing the face of someone other than a person who has returned from travelling, etc – apart from a child – this is makrooh, as was clearly stated by al-Baghawi and others… As for a handsome beardless youth, it is haraam to kiss him under any circumstances, whether he is returning from a journey or not. It seems that embracing him is akin to kissing him, whether the one who is kissing or the one who is kissed are righteous or otherwise. End quote from al-Majmoo’, 4/477 
The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked: There is the phenomenon of young men kissing one another on the cheeks every time they meet, every day. This phenomenon has also spread among old men, in the mosques and in the classrooms. Is this contrary to the Sunnah or is there nothing wrong with it? Is it a bid’ah or a sin or is it permissible? 
They replied: 
What is prescribed when meeting is to say salaam and shake hands, If the meeting is after a journey then it is prescribed to embrace as well, because it is narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) met, they would shake hands, and if they had come from a journey they would embrace. As for kissing the cheeks, we do not know of any Sunnah to indicate that. End quote. 
Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 24/128 
Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth al-Saheehah (1/74, hadith no. 160): This is the hadith of al-Tirmidhi that we mentioned at the beginning of our answer: 
In fact the hadith clearly states that kissing when meeting is not prescribed in Islam. That does not include kissing one's children or wife, as is obvious. 
With regard to the ahaadeeth which state that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) kissed some of his companions on various occasions – such as when he kissed and embraced Zayd ibn Haarithah when he came to Madeenah, and when he embraced Abu’l-Haytham ibn al-Tayhaan, etc – the following points may be noted in response to that: 
1 – These are unsound ahaadeeth which cannot be taken as evidence. 
2 – Even if any of them were saheeh, it is not permissible to use them against this saheeh hadith, because it is an action on the part of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which may be interpreted as applying to a specific case or there may be some specific reason for that which makes this hadith unfit to be used as evidence, unlike this hadith, which is a verbal hadith that is addressed in general terms to the ummah as a whole, so it is string evidence which cannot be rejected. It is established in the field of usool that words take precedence over deeds in the event of a conflict, and the hadith which indicates a prohibition takes precedence over another which indicates permissibility. This hadith is verbal and indicates a prohibition, so it takes precedence over the other ahaadeeth mentioned even if they are saheeh. 
Similarly, with regard to hugging and embracing, we say that it is not prescribed because the hadith forbids it, but Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) met, they would shake hands, and if they had come from a journey they would embrace Narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Awsat, and its men are the men of saheeh, as stated by al-Mundhiri (3/270), and al-Bayhaqi, 8/36 
Al-Bayhaqi (7/100) narrated with a saheeh isnaad from al-Sha’bi that when the companions of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) met, they would shake hands, and when they came from a journey they would embrace one another. 
Al-Bukhari narrated in al-Adab al-Mufrad (970), and Ahmad narrated (3/495) that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah said: I heard that a man knew a hadith and had heard it from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). I bought a camel, loaded my luggage onto it, and traveled for a month until I came to Syria, where I found ‘Abd-Allah ibn Unays. I said to the doorkeeper: Tell him: Jaabir is at the door. He said: Ibn ‘Abd-Allah? I said: Yes. He came out tripping on his garment and he embraced me and I embraced him… Its isnaad is hasan as stated by al-Haafiz, 1/195. al-Bukhari narrated it among the mu’aalaq reports. 
So it may be said that embracing in the case of a journey is exempted from the prohibition, because the Sahaabah did that. End quote.

60358,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60358,How Many Days Can You Shorten Prayers?,"During the summer vacation, we went on a trip for twenty days, and during this time we shortened our prayers because the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) went on trips for six months and shortened their prayers. Is this view correct? Do we have to make up the days that have passed?","A traveller may shorten his prayer so long as he is not staying in the place to which he has gone for four or more days, whether he travels for work, medical treatment, a vacation or any other reason.","Qasr Prayer: For how many days?


Did the Companions travel for vacations?


Should you make up the prayers that you shortened?","Praise be to Allah.Qasr Prayer: For how many days?
The majority of scholars are of the view that a traveller may avail himself of the concessions of travel so long as he is not staying in the place to which he has gone for four or more days , whether he travels for work, medical treatment, a vacation or any other reason. 
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The well-known view of Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) is that the period during which the traveller must perform his prayers in full with the intention of staying is a period in which there are more than twenty-one prayers. And it was narrated from him that if he intends to stay for more than four days he must perform his prayers in full, but if he intends to stay less than that, he may shorten them . This is also the view of Malik and al-Shafi’i.” (Al-Mughni, 2/65) 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah (8/109): 
“The basic principle is that the traveller who is actually travelling is the one who is granted a concession allowing him to shorten the four-rak’ah prayers , because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And when you (Muslims) travel in the land, there is no sin on you if you shorten As-Salah (the prayer)” [al-Nisa 4:101]
And Ya’la ibn Umayyah said: I said to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him): “ ‘And when you (Muslims) travel in the land, there is no sin on you if you shorten the prayer if you fear that the disbelievers may put you in trial (attack you),’” He said: I wondered the same thing as you, and I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about it, and he said: “It is a charity that Allah has bestowed upon you, so accept His charity.” (Narrated by Muslim)
The one who stays in a place for four days and nights or less also comes under the ruling of the traveller who is actually travelling, because it is proven in the hadith of Jabir and Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Makkah on the fourth of Dhu’l-Hijjah for the Farewell Pilgrimage, and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stayed for the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh, and he prayed Fajr in al-Abtah on the eighth day, and he shortened his prayers during those days. He had formed the intention to stay, as is well known. So everyone who travels and intends to stay for this length of time that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stayed, or less, may shorten his prayers. Whoever intends to stay longer than that should offer the prayers in full, because he does not come under the heading of a traveler. 
But if a person stays for longer than four days during his trip and has not formed the intention to stay, rather he has resolved that when he has finished his business he will go back, like one who stays in a place to engage in jihad against the enemy, or has been detained by the authorities or by sickness, but he has resolved that when the jihad ends with victory or a peace treaty, or the sickness or enemy power that is keeping him there ends, or he sells all his goods and so on, he will go back, then he is regarded as a traveller, and he may shorten the four-rak’ah prayers, even if that period is long, because it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stayed in Makkah during the year of the Conquest for nineteen days, during which he shortened his prayers, and he stayed in Tabuk for twenty days to fight the Christians, and he led his Companions in shortened prayers, because he had not resolved to stay, rather his intention was to leave once he had finished his business.”  
Did the Companions travel for vacations?
The Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) did not travel for a vacation for six months as mentioned in the question. Rather they would travel for jihad for the sake of Allah, or to seek knowledge, or to seek a halal provision, and other religious and worldly interests, such as Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who stayed in Azerbaijan for six months, and snow kept him from entering, and he shortened his prayers. 
Should you make up the prayers that you shortened?
You do not have to make up the prayers that you shortened during this time, because it is possible that you may come under the category of travelling. The Standing Committee was asked about a person who was sent by Saudi to Germany, who stayed there for nearly one and half years and he shortened his prayers. They replied: 
“You do not have to make up the prayers that you shortened or delayed or joined with other prayers, because it is possible that you may come under the heading of travelling. But in the future, you should pray the four-rak'ah prayers in full and offer every prayer on time, because the ruling of travel no longer applies to you, because you have resolved to stay, and you have resolved to stay for more than four days. So you have to pray in congregation if possible, and do not pray alone.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 8/155)

60359,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60359,Getting Rid of an Amulet,"A man who works with my father convinced him that he was being affected by the evil eye. He brought him an amulet and said: Put it in your pocket and it will protect you against the evil eye. Then after that he got a paper on which was written alif, ba’, ‘ayn, daal [Arabic letters] and at the bottom of the paper it said “Allah is the protector” and some other incomprehensible letters and mumbo jumbo and scribbles. We want to get rid of this paper because it is something that is not permitted in Islam, but we do not know the correct way to get rid of it without bringing any harm upon ourselves. I hope that you can offer us some helpful words and advise us.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The evil eye is real as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us, and the way to protect oneself against it is by reciting the ruqyahs (incantations) that are prescribed in sharee’ah (Islamic law) and by reciting the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), not by using amulets or by using the charms written by liars and charlatans. For more information about the evil eye and the ways of protecting oneself against it, please see question no.  20954 and  11359.
Carrying amulets and charms for the purpose of protecting oneself against the evil eye and witchcraft comes under the heading of wearing amulets which is forbidden. It was narrated from ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir al-Juhani (may Allah be pleased with him) that some people came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he accepted the oath of allegiance from nine of them and not from one man. They said: O Messenger of Allah, you accepted the allegiance of nine and not from one. He said: “He is wearing an amulet.” So he put his hand in (his garment) and broke it, then he accepted his oath of allegiance and said: “Whoever wears an amulet has associated others with Allah (shirk).” Narrated by Ahmad (16781); classed as saheeh (authentic) by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (492). 
Ahmad also narrated that ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever wears an amulet, may Allah never fulfill his wish and whoever wears a seashell, may Allah never protect him from what he fears.” This hadeeth (narration) was classed as hasan (sound) by al-Arna’oot in his commentary on al-Musnad. 
Seashells were worn to ward off the evil eye. 
Al-Khattabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Amulets were things that they used to wear in the belief that they could ward off calamity. 
Al-Baghawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The Arabs used to put amulets on their children to protect them against the evil eye, or so they claimed. This was declared invalid by sharee’ah.
The correct scholarly view is that amulets are forbidden even if they are composed of words from the Quran. See question no.  10543. As for those that contain unknown letters and words, there is no difference of opinion; they are haram (impermissible) and there is no guarantee that they are not magic or that they are not seeking the help of the jinn.
Thirdly:
The way to get rid of amulets and magic when they are discovered is by undoing the knots – if there are knots – and separating the pieces, then destroying them by burning and the like, because it is narrated that Zayd ibn Arqam (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A Jewish man used to enter upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who trusted him. He tied some knots and placed them in a well belonging to a man from among the Ansar (inhabitants of Madinah who welcomed the immigrants from Makkah). He suffered because of this for several days – or, according to the hadeeth of ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), for six months – then two angels came to visit him. One sat at his head and the other at his feet. One of them said, “Do you know what is ailing him?” He said: “So and so who used to enter upon him tied some knots for him and threw them into the well of so and so, the Ansari. He should send a man to him to take the bundle out, and he will find that the water has turned yellow.” Then Jibreel (peace be upon him) came to him, bringing the revelation of al-Mu’awwadhatayn, and he told him that a Jewish man had bewitched him and that the materials used were in the well of so and so. Then he sent a man – according to another isnad (chain of narration), he sent ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) – who found that the water had turned yellow. He took out the bundle and brought it to him, and he told him to untie it and recite a verse of Quran. He started to recite and untie it, and every time he untied a knot, he felt a little better, until he was fully recovered.” 
[al-Haakim, al-Nasaa’i, Ahmad, and al-Tabaraani]. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Efforts should be made to find out what the witch has done. If he has put some hair, for example, in a certain place, or put it in a comb and so on, if it is known that he has put it in a certain place, it should be taken out and burned or destroyed. Then its effects will be cancelled out and what the witch wanted to do will be annulled.
So to get rid of the paper that your father has, tear it up and burn it, and remind him to repent to Allah from having worn an amulet.

    person who is suffering from urinary incontinence to lead in prayer one who 
    is similarly afflicted, but with regard to him leading a healthy man in 
    prayer, there is a difference of scholarly opinion as to whether it is 
    permissible for him to do so. 
Some scholars are of the 
    view that it is not permitted and that the prayer is invalid, and others are 
    of the view that it is permitted. 

    It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (25/187): 

    The fuqaha’ are unanimously agreed that if the imam is sick 
    and suffering from incontinence, and the person praying behind him is 
    similarly afflicted, then his prayer is valid. But if the imam is sick and 
    suffering from incontinence, and the person praying behind him is healthy, 
    then there is a difference of opinion among the fuqaha’ as to whether it is 
    permissible for a sick person to lead healthy people in prayer. There are 
    two opinions: 

    1 – The view of the Hanafis and Hanbalis is that it is not 
    permissible, because those who have limitations may pray with hadath 
    (impurity) in a real sense, but the hadath in their case is regarded as if 
    it does not exist, because they need to perform their duties; this is an 
    exception which applies only to them, as the degree of necessity should not 
    be overestimated. The healthy man is in a stronger position than the one who 
    has limitations, and something strong cannot be built on something that is 
    weak. 

    2 – The view of the Maalikis and Shaafa’is is that it is 
    permissible, because their prayer is valid and does not have to be repeated, 
    and because if they are excused, others may be excused also. But the 
    Maalikis stated that it is makrooh for people with limitations to lead 
    healthy people in prayer. End quote. 

    See al-Majmoo’, 4/160 
The scholars of the 
    Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked: What is the ruling on 
    prayers being led by one who is suffering from urinary incontinence? 

    They replied: 
If a person is suffering 
    from urinary incontinence and the like, his prayer by himself is valid 
    because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  

    “So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you 
    can”

    [al-Taghaabun 64:16]

    “Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope”

    [al-Baqarah 2:286] 

    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “If I command you to do a thing, then do as much of it as you 
    can.” 

    But there is a difference of scholarly opinion concerning the 
    validity of a prayer in which such a person leads healthy people. The 
    correct view is that it is valid, but it is better for someone else who is 
    healthy to lead the prayer, so as to avoid an area of scholarly dispute. End

     Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 7/397 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ 
    (4/172, 173): 
His prayer – i.e., the 
    prayer of one who is suffering urinary incontinence – when led by an imam 
    who is free of this problem is valid, and his prayer when he leads another 
    who has the same problem is also valid. These are two scenarios. 

    The third scenario is when he prays as an imam leading 
    someone who is free of this problem. Some of the scholars said that his 
    prayer is not valid; if a person who is suffering from urinary incontinence 
    leads a man who is free of this problem in prayer, the prayer of the one who 
    prays behind him is invalid and his prayer is also invalid, because he 
    intended to lead in prayer one for whom it was not valid for him to lead, 
    unless he was unaware of his condition. 

    The reason why it is not valid for him to lead the prayer is 
    that the condition of the one who has urinary incontinence is inferior to 
    that of one who is free of this problem, and the condition of the one who is 
    led in prayer should not be superior to the condition of the one who is 
    leading the prayer. 

    But the correct view on this matter is that it is valid for 
    the one who is suffering from urinary incontinence to lead both a person who 
    is like him and one who is healthy. 

    The evidence for that is the general meaning of the words of 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “The people 
    should be led in prayer by the one among them who has most knowledge of the 
    Book of Allaah.” This man’s prayer is valid, because he is doing what is 
    required of him, and if his prayer is valid, it follows from that that his 
    leading the prayer is also valid. 
Their view that the person who is led in 
    prayer cannot be in a better situation that the imam is refuted by the fact 
    that the prayer of one who has done wudoo’ behind one who has done tayammum 
    is valid. They say that even though the one who has done wudoo’ is in a 
    superior situation, but they say that the tahaarah of the one who has done 
    tayammum is valid. We say: the tahaarah of one who is suffering from urinary 
    incontinence is also valid. End quote.",Islam Q&A
