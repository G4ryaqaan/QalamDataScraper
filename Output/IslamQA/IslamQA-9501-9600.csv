9506,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9506,Parent’s Permission to Go for Jihaad,"I want to find out about jihaad (fighting) for the sake of Allaah. I am the eldest of my brothers and my father is dead, but my mother is alive and I have a wife and children. I asked my mother to agree to my going for jihaad but she refused. Can I go for jihaad?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Jihaad
      is one of the best of deeds, as is honouring one’s parents. If a person
      wants to go for jihaad, he has to ask their permission. If they give him
      their permission, all well and good, otherwise he should not go for
      jihaad, and he should stay with them. Staying with both or one of them is a kind of jihaad (striving for the sake of Allah). The basis for that is the report of Ibn Mas’ood (may
      Allaah be pleased with him), who said: “I asked the Messenger of Allaah
      
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), ‘Which deed is most
      beloved to Allaah?’ He said, ‘Prayer done on time.’ I said, ‘Then
      what?’ He said, ‘Honouring one's parents.’ I said, ‘Then what?’
      He said, ‘Jihaad for the sake of Allaah.’ The Messenger of Allaah 
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told me about them and if I
      had asked more he would have told me more.” (Agreed
      upon. Al-Bukhaari, 1/134; Muslim, 1/89-90)
 ‘Abd-Allaah
      ibn ‘Amr (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: “A man came to
      the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and asked for
      his permission to go for jihaad. He said, ‘Are your parents alive?’ He
      said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘Then your jihaad is with them.’” (Narrated
      by al-Bukhaari, 4/18). According to another
      report: A man came and said, “O Messenger of Allaah, I have come to
      engage in jihaad with you. I came and my parents were weeping.” He said,
      “Go back and make them smile as you have made them weep.” (Narrated
      by Ahmad, 2/160; Abu Dawood, 3/38).
 It
      was reported from Abu Sa’eed (may Allaah be pleased with him) that “a
      man migrated to the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
      him) from the Yemen. He [the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah
      be upon him)] said, ‘Do you have anyone in the Yemen?’ He said, ‘My
      parents.’ He said, ‘Did they give you permission?’ He said,
      ‘No.’ He said, ‘Then go back to them and ask their permission. If
      they give you permission, then go for jihaad, otherwise honour them.’”
      (Narrated by Ahmad,
      3/75-76; Abu Dawood, 3/39).
It
      was reported from Mu’aawiyah ibn Jaahimah al-Sulami that Jaahimah came
      to the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said,
      “O Messenger of Allaah, I want to go out for jihaad, and I have come to
      consult you.” He said, “Do you have a mother?” He said, “Yes.”
      He said, “Then stay with her, for Paradise is at her feet.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 3/429; al-Nisaa’i, 6/11).
All of these reports and similar
      ones refer to the person for whom jihaad is not an individual obligation.
      But if it becomes obligatory on an individual and he does not go for
      jihaad, this is a sin, for there should be no obedience to any created
      being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator. Among the things
      that make jihaad obligatory on individuals is when the imaam [Muslim
      ruler] calls him for jihaad, in which case he has to go to the front line.
      And Allaah is the source of strength. May Allaah bless our Prophet
      Muhammad and his family and companions, and grant them peace.","Fataawaa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 12/18"
9514,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9514,What is the Role of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him)?,"I would like to know what the duties and functions of Jesus as ""Al-Masih"" in Islam are. Many Christian anti-Islamic sites have been asking this question. It’s not that my faith is not strong, but I could not explain my answer properly. Perhaps you can help me.",,,"Praise be to Allah.‘Eesa (peace be upon him) has two roles: 
1-His first role, which was before Allah raised him up to heaven when the Jews wanted to crucify him. His role at that time was, like that of any other Prophet, to convey the Message. Allah gave him the Injeel (Gospel) to confirm the Tawraat (Torah), and He gave him miracles which are well known, such as healing the blind and lepers, and raising the dead by Allah’s leave, and other well known miracles.
“He called his people to worship Allah Alone and to believe in Him alone (Tawheed), and he was a witness against them throughout his stay among them.” 
2-His second role will come at the end of time, when the Dajjaal (false messiah) will emerge. Allah will send ‘Eesa down to the earth, and he will be a leader of the believers who will rule them according to the Islamic sharee’ah (law). He will kill the Dajjaal, and the Mahdi (rightly guided leader) will appear during his time. Blessings will come down from Allah such that the milk of one camel will be sufficient for a large number of people, and wealth will be abundant. During his time Ya’jooj and Ma’jooj (Gog and Magog) will emerge and will spread mischief throughout the earth. “Allah will destroy them and ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) will rule the earth according to Islamic sharee’ah , until he dies and the Muslims offer the funeral prayer for him.” Then Allah will send a cool breeze which will take the soul of every believer, and after that none will be left except the most evil of people, upon whom the Hour will come.",Shaykh Sa’d al-Humayd
9515,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9515,Importance of Hijab in Islam,Is it right for someone to say that since wearing Hijab is not one of the five pillars of Islam therefore it is really not that important?,"Hijab is obligatory for women. Allah commanded women to cover their adornments, including the face, bosom and all their adornments. Hijab has been enjoined upon women as a protection against abuse and temptation.",,"Praise be to Allah.This is a mistake, because Hijab is obligatory for women . Allah is the One Who has commanded women to cover their adornments , including the face, bosom and all their adornments. 
Hijab has been enjoined upon women as a protection against abuse and temptation. That is because women are the focus of desire, and the focus of what those who are tempted look at.
So if a woman uncovers her beauty she will provoke desire, and people will become attracted to her and will follow her. This is the cause of many immoral actions such as adultery and the things that lead to it. So Hijab is obligatory for women and was enjoined upon them in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):
“…and to draw their veils all over Juyubihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)…” [An-Nur 24:31]
The veil (Khimar ) is that which comes down from the head and covers the face, and the Jilbab is an outer garment with which a woman covers herself, leaving no part of her body showing.
And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“…And when you ask (his [the Prophet’s] wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen…” [Al-Ahzab 33:53] 
So Hijab is a protection for women so that there will be no room for people to treat them as playthings.

9516,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9516,Should the easier fatwa be followed?,"I know that the normal people are to ask people of knowledge about issues that they do not know and that we are to follow the opinion of someone we trust. However, how do we select between fatawaas of two or three different 'aalims each of whom we trust and who are known for their knowledge and piety and the 'aalims themselves respect each other. So if we select the easier one of the fataawas, are we liable ? Please clarify this important issue.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It 
          is not permissible for you to follow the easier fatwa, rather you have 
          to fear Allaah and not follow your own desires. You should be determined 
          to follow the truth even though it may be bitter to you. With regard 
          to muftis (scholars who issue fatwas), you must look at two important 
          matters  
1)Their taqwa (piety), awareness of Allaah and righteousness  Their 
          knowledge .  
These 
          two matters are essential to the mufti. They are like the wings of a 
          bird; one is no use without the other. If you see visible signs of righteousness 
          in the mufti, and you can see enough of his awareness of Allaah and 
          piety to make you feel reassured that whims and desires will not lead 
          him to speak about Allaah without knowledge or contrary to the evidence 
          (daleel), then this takes care of the first matter. If we add to that 
          what you can see of his knowledge of the shar’i evidence and his understanding, 
          this will make you feel confident about his fatwas. If you find another 
          who is like him or is close to him in knowledge and taqwa, but he gives 
          a different fatwa, then you have to look for something that will make 
          you feel that the truth is with one of them, such as when one of them 
          mentions and refutes the evidence of the other. 
A mufti is like a doctor. Do you not see that some doctors are more knowledgeable than others? Don’t you feel more comfortable with one than another, because you see that he is more concerned with diagnosing your sickness properly, so he listens to your complaints carefully and asks lots of questions related to your sickness. Whilst you may see another doctor who is in such a hurry to take a decision that this makes you complain about him, and he may give you medicine that has nothing to do with your sickness. Just as you try hard to choose the right doctor to treat your body, so you must also try hard to find the right mufti, who is the one who you think will help you to keep your religious commitment sound, even if it is bitter to you.",Shaykh Sa’d al-Humayd
9519,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9519,Belief in the Books of Allah,What does it mean to believe in the Books of Allah?,"Belief in the Books of Allah implies: 1- Firm belief that all of them were revealed from Allah, 2- The Books that Allah has mentioned by name, we must believe in by name, and those which Allah has mentioned in general terms, we must believe in them in general terms, 3- Believing whatever is true of what they say, and 4- Believing that Allah revealed the Quran as a witness over these Books and to confirm them.","Meaning of belief in the Books of Allah


Benefits of belief in the Books of Allah","Praise be to Allah.Meaning of belief in the Books of Allah
Belief in the Books of Allah implies four things: 

Firm belief that all of them were revealed from Allah, and that Allah spoke them in a real sense. Some of them were heard from Him from behind a veil, without there being any intermediary from among the angels. Some were conveyed by an angelic messenger to a human messenger. Some were written by Allah’s own Hand, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“It is not given to any human being that Allah should speak to him unless (it be) by Revelation, or from behind a veil, or (that) He sends a messenger to reveal what He wills by His Leave. Verily, He is Most High, Most Wise.” [42:51] 
“… and to Musa Allah spoke directly.” [4:164] 
And Allah said concerning the Tawrat: 
“And We wrote for him on the Tablets the lesson to be drawn from all things and the explanation for all things.” [7:145] 

The Books that Allah has mentioned by name , we must believe in by name. These are the Books which Allah has named in the Quran, i.e., the Quran, the Tawrat, the Injil (Gospel), the Zabur (Psalms) , and the Scriptures of Ibrahim and Musa . 

Those which Allah has mentioned in general terms, we must believe in them in general terms, so we say concerning them what Allah and His Messenger have commanded us to say: 
“…say: “I believe in whatsoever Allah has sent down of the Book [all the noble Books…].” [42:15 – interpretation of the meaning] 

Believing whatever is true of what they say, such as what is said in the Quran, and whatever has not been altered or distorted in the previous Books. 
Believing that Allah revealed the Quran as a witness over these Books and to confirm them, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad) the Book (this Quran) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and Muhaymin (trustworthy in highness and a witness) over it (old Scriptures).” [5:48] 
The commentators said that Muhaymin means trustworthy and a witness over the Books that came before it, and confirming them, i.e., confirming whatever is true in them and rejecting whatever alterations, distortions and changes have occurred in them, and ruling that the previous rulings have been abrogated – i.e., they are no longer applicable – and that new rulings and laws have been promulgated. Hence all those who were following previous books and who have not turned on their heels should submit to it, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And when it is recited to them, they say: We believe in it. Verily, it is the truth from our Lord. Indeed even before it we have been from those who submit themselves to Allah in Islam as Muslims.” [28:52-53] 
It is obligatory for all the ummah (followers of Muhammad) to follow the Quran both outwardly and inwardly, and to adhere to it, and give it its due, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And this is a blessed Book (the Quran) which We have sent down, so follow it and fear Allah.” [6:155] 
What is meant by adhering to the Quran and giving it its due is: regarding what it permits as permitted, regarding what it forbids as forbidden, obeying its commands, avoiding that which it prohibits, paying heed to its lessons, learning from its stories, understanding its clear and unambiguous texts, referring the exact meaning of its ambiguous texts to Allah, not overstepping its limits and defending it, whilst memorizing it, reciting it in a proper manner, pondering the meanings of its verses, reciting it in prayer night and day, being sincere towards it in all senses, and calling others to do likewise with understanding. 
Benefits of belief in the Books of Allah
Belief in the Books of Allah will bear great fruit for a person, the most important of which is: 

Knowledge of Allah’s care for His slaves, for He has revealed to each people a Book by which they may be guided.
Knowledge of the wisdom of Allah in the laws which He has set out for each people, laws which are suited to their circumstances as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “To each among you, We have prescribed a law and a clear way.” [5:48].
Fulfilling the duty of giving thanks to Allah for this great blessing.
The importance of paying attention to the Quran, by reading it, pondering its meanings, understanding its meanings and acting accordingly.

And another man says, “I ask for what I need from Allaah and from you” Is this false or not? Is it permissible to say this or not?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Whoever does not believe that the five daily prayers, paying zakaah, fasting in Ramadaan and going on Pilgrimage to the Ancient House are obligatory, and does not regard as haraam the things which Allaah has forbidden such as obscene actions, wrongdoing, shirk and lying, is a kaafir and an apostate. He should be asked to repent, and if he repents then all well and good, otherwise he should be executed – according to the consensus (ijmaa’) of the imaams of the Muslims. It is not enough for him merely to speak the words of the Shahaadatayn. 
If he says, I accept that that is compulsory for me, and I know that it is fard (obligatory), and that whoever does not do it deserves the condemnation and punishment of Allaah, but I do not do it, then he also deserves punishment in this world and in the Hereafter, according to the consensus of the Muslims. He is obliged to pray the five daily prayers, according to scholarly consensus. Most of the scholars say that he should be ordered to pray, and if he does not pray, then he should be executed. If he persists in not praying until he is executed then he is a kaafir, according to scholarly consensus; he should not be washed, the funeral prayer should not be offered over him, and he should not be buried in the Muslim graveyard. 
Whoever says that everyone who says the words of the Shahaadatayn, but does not do the obligatory duties or avoid things which are haraam, will enter Paradise, and that none of them will be punished in the Fire, is a kaafir and an apostate. He must be asked to repent, and if he repents, all  well and good – otherwise he should be executed. Those who utter the Shahaadatayn are of various kinds, and some of them are munaafiqoon (hypocrites) who will be in the lowest level of Hell, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning);
“Verily, the hyprocrites will be in the lowest depth (grade) of the Fire; no helper will you find for them.
Except those who repent (from hypocrisy), do righteous good deeds, hold fast to Allaah, and purify their religion for Allaah (by worshipping none but Allaah, and do good for Allaah’s sake only, not to show off), then they will be with the believers”
[al-Nisaa’ 4:145-146]
“Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allaah, but it is He Who deceives them. And when they stand up for As-Salât (the prayer), they stand with laziness…”[al-Nisaa’ 4:142] 
In Saheeh Muslim it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “That is the prayer of the munaafiq. He waits until the sun is between the horns of the Shaytaan (i.e., just before sunset), then he pecks four times, and he does not remember Allaah, except a little.” (Muslim, 195/622). 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained that the one who delays the prayer and pecks (prays too quickly) is a hypocrite, so how about the one who does not pray at all?! 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning);
“So woe unto those performers of Salaah (prayers) (hypocrites),
Those who delay their Salaah (prayer from their stated fixed times).
Those who do good deeds only to be seen (of men),[al-Maa’oon 107:4-6] 
The scholars said: those who delay their salaah are those who postpone it until after the appointed time, and those who are negligent with regard to the obligations of the prayer. If these worshippers are condemned, then how about people who do not pray at all?! 
It was narrated in al-Saheehayn that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) will recognize his ummah by the bright marks that they will have (on their bodies) because of wudoo’ (Muslim, Kitaab al-Tahaarah, 249/39). These bright marks will appear on those who did wudoo’ and prayed. Their faces will be white because of wudoo’, and their hands and feet will be white because of wudoo’. The one who prays will have this bright mark, and the one who does not do wudoo’ or pray will not have this bright mark. So he will not have the symbol of the Muslims which is the “insignia” (like the symbol of the kings and princes of the Turks and Mamluks in Egypt) of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), like the “insignia” by which a leader knows his companions. So he will not belong to the ummah of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It was reported in al-Saheeh that the Fire will consume everything of the son of Adam apart from the marks of prostration (al-Bukhaari, no. 806). Whoever is not one of those who prostrate to the One God, the Forgiving, the Loving, the Lord of the Mighty Throne, will be consumed by the Fire. In al-Saheeh it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is nothing that stands between a person and shirk except his not praying.” (Muslim, 82/34). And he said: “The covenant that stands between us and them is prayer. Whoever does not pray is a kaafir.” (al-Tirmidhi, 2621). And he said: “The first of his deeds for which the slave will be brought to account is his salaah.” (Abu Dawood, no. 864; al-Tirmidhi, 413).
 No person should say, “What Allaah wills and what So-and-so wills” or “I ask for my need from Allaah then from So-and-so.” As it says in the hadeeth from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Do not say, what Allaah wills and what Muhammad wills. Rather say: what Allaah wills then Muhammad wills.” (Ibn Maajah, 2118). A man said to him, “What Allaah wills and what you will.” He said, “Are you making me a rival to Allaah? Rather what Allaah Alone wills.” (Ahmad, 1/214)

9561,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9561,It is difficult for him to pray because his work is hard,"Do you call one who prays Salaah 1 or 2 or 3 times a day a kaafir ? It is not easy for normal humans to pray 5 times a day as even Prophet Musa during Mi'raj said it would be difficult for our Prophet's ummah to fulfill this. But he still said we are from his ummah. And we have belief in the articles of faith. But we do not get paid to pray like Imaams or paid to be scholars and do Islamic research. 
We have families and children who we look after and work 12  hours a day toiling in physical and mental activities to earn bread and so it is hard to fulfill all salaahs out of tiredness. Do you still consider us to be kaafirs even though we pray some of the salaah and pay zakaah and fast in Ramadan and believe in the articles of faith ? This is very important for me to know.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah
      has enjoined upon His slaves five prayers every day, day and night. He has
      commanded them to observe these prayers regularly and establish them, and
      He praises those who do so. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
      
      
“And
      perform As-Salaat (Iqaamat-as-Salaat), and give Zakaat, and bow down (or
      submit yourselves with obedience to Allaah) along with
      Ar‑Raaki‘oon (those who bow or submit themselves to Allaah)”
      [al-Baqarah 2:43]
      
      
 “Guard
      strictly (five obligatory) As‑Salawaat (the prayers) especially the
      middle Salaat (i.e. the best prayer ‑ ‘Asr). And stand before
      Allaah with obedience [and do not speak to others during the Salaat
      (prayers)]” [al-Baqarah 2:238]
      
      
 “Successful
      indeed are the believers.
      
      
Those
      who offer their Salaat (prayers) with all solemnity and full
      submissiveness” [al-Mu’minoon 23:1-2]
      
      
“And
      those who strictly guard their (five compulsory congregational) Salawaat
      (prayers) (at their fixed stated hours).” [al-Mu’minoon 23:9]
 So
      you have to pay attention to establishing regular prayer and keeping it
      up, and focusing on it, and taking the specific means of achieving that,
      so that you may be one of the successful. Do not worry yourself by
      thinking about the ruling on one who misses one or two prayers and whether
      he is a kaafir or not.
      
      
 Whoever
      deliberately misses a prayer exposes himself to the wrath of Allaah, and
      the wise believer does not do something which he knows could result in
      punishment, even if it is not kufr as such. The five daily prayers, and
      all other acts of worship, and avoiding what is forbidden – none of this
      can be achieved except with patience. These are things which people find
      difficult by nature, because they come between a person and some of his
      desires.The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
      “Paradise is surrounded by things which are disliked.” The issue of
      prayer in Islam is very important. Hence the responsible adult is not let
      off prayer for as long as he is alive and he is in his right mind. But
      Allaah has made things easier for His slaves with regard to the duty of
      praying. He allows us to join prayers and shorten them whilst travelling,
      and He allows us tojoin
      prayers when we are not travelling if not doing so will cause greater
      hardship. He allows the sick person to pray according to what he can do,
      standing, sitting or lying on his side. Hence we know that being busy
      earning a living is not an excuse for not praying. But if there is some
      unusual hardship involved, it is permissible to pray Zuhr and ‘Asr
      together at the time of either of them, and to pray Maghrib and ‘Isha’
      together at the time of either of them.
      
      
 Allaah
      commanded us to stop trading in order to pray Jumu’ah (Friday prayers),
      and He praised those who do not let trades or sales divert them from the
      remembrance of Allaah. So strive to do the prayers on time and in
      congregation. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
      said: “Praying in congregation is twenty-seven times better than praying
      alone.”
      
      
 Note
      that praying regularly is one of the greatest means of attaining the mercy
      of Allaah and His pleasure and His Paradise, which is the main goal.It is
      also a means of making earning one’s provision easier, as Allaah says
      (interpretation of the meaning):

 The
      Muslim does not ask people for any reward for his worhip of his Lord. He
      prays for Allaah, he fasts for Allaah, he does Hajj for Allaah, and he
      hopes for the reward of Allaah. When you say we do not get get paid to
      pray like the imaams, this is a mistake in your way ofthinking. It is not permissible for the imaam to take a salary for
      doing the prayers; imaams and muezzins are being paid for doing a job
      which requires them to to be present at the mosque every time (so that
      they can devote their time to doing their duties of leading prayers,
      giving khutbahs, issuing fatwas and judging between people). But it is
      better for a Muslim to fulfil the duties of an imaam or muezzin
      voluntarily, hoping for the reward of Allaah. 
      
      
 When
      you say we have families, children, etc… this is not an excuse for
      missing some of the prayers. You have to devote some of your time to doing
      the prayers. It is only a small amount of time, for each prayer, doing it
      and preparing for it, does not take more than a quarter of an hour.  
      
      
If
      you do give up some of the prayers because you are too busy seeking
      provision, we will not confirm that you are a kaafir, but we will say that
      you are a sinner who is committing a major sin. We have already stated
      above that in cases of unusual difficulty you can put Zuhr and ‘Asr
      together at the time of either ofthem,.
      We also remind you that it is essential to pray fajr at the right time,
      which is from the start of dawn until the sun rises.

9562,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9562,Warning to the one who shows off and boasts about his sin,I boasted about my sins that I committed that Allah had hidden from people. I read such a person cannot be forgiven ? Is this true ? Is there any way out ?,,,"Praise be to Allah.The Muslim should be far removed from obscenity and obscene actions. One of the most evil of things is that Muslims should openly manifest their immoral actions and their being far from Allaah. An example of this is when a Muslim commits a sin which angers Allaah, His Creator, Master and Lord, and Allaah, the Concealer, the Most Generous, the Forgiver, who could, if He willed, cause the earth to swallow him when he is committing that promiscuous act and neglecting the sacred limits set by Allaah, conceals his action. Even worse than that, he becomes proud of angering Allaah and spreads news of that among people, uncovering that which Allaah has concealed from the people. How could Allaah forgive something like this?
Hence Allaah may deprive a person like this of repentance.  
It was narrated that Saalim ibn ‘Abd-Allaah said: I heard Abu Hurayrah say: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
“All of my ummah will be fine except for those who commit sin openly. Part of committing sin openly is when a man does something at night and Allaah conceals it, but in the morning he says, ‘O So-and-so, last night I did such and such.’ His Lord had covered his sin all night, but in the morning he removed the cover of Allaah.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5721; Muslim, 2990)
  Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said:
 Concerning the command to cover or conceal, a hadeeth was narrated which does not meet the conditions of al-Bukhaari. This is the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar which is attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Avoid these obscenities which Allaah has forbidden. Whoever commits any of them, let him be concealed with the concealment of Allaah.” The hadeeth was narrated by al-Haakim and is also included in al-Muwatta’ as one of the mursal reports of Zayd ibn Aslam.
Ibn Battaal said: Openly flaunting one’s sins implies disrespect towards Allaah and His Messenger, and the righteous believers, and is a type of stubborn provocation. Concealing sin protects one against being disrespectful in this manner, because sin brings humiliation upon the people who commit it, such as the hadd punishment if it is a sin that carries such a penalty, or the ta’zeer penalty if no hadd is enjoined. If it is something which violates the rights of Allaah, then He is the Most Generous and His Mercy precedes His Wrath. Hence if He conceals it in this world, He will not expose it in the Hereafter, but the one who flaunts it openly loses all of that.
  The hadeeth clearly condemns those who openly flaunt their sin, which implies praise of those who conceal their sin. The fact that Allaah conceals it implies that the believer must also cover himself. Whoever deliberately flaunts his sin angers his Lord, Who will not then cover him. Whoever deliberately conceals his sin out of shame before his Lord and before people, Allaah will bless him by concealing it. (Fath al-Baari, 10/487-488)
al-Mannaawi said:
  What is meant is those who talk openly to one another about their sins. Ibn Jamaa’ah included in this disclosure of what happens between husband and wife of permissible things. This is supported by the famous report which warns against that: “It is part of flaunting one’s sins” – i.e., speaking openly about them and broadcasting them – “that a man should do an evil deed at night, then the following morning, when Allaah had covered him, he says, ‘Last night I did such and such’ – when all night his Lord had concealed his sin, but in the morning he uncovers what Allaah had concealed.” – by telling people about his sin. This is a betrayal on his part of the covering of Allaah which had been lowered upon him, and a provocation of the desire for evil in the people who hear him or see him. So these are two offences which are added to his original offence and make it worse. If in addition to that he encourages others to do likewise, this is a fourth offence that makes the matter even worse… The implication is that they have no sins unless they flaunt them, then he explained that the one who flaunts his sin is the one who does something at night and his Lord conceals it, then in the morning he says, ‘O So-and-so, last night I did such and such,’ so he removes the covering of Allaah. He is to be condemned in this world by carrying out the hadd punishment, for it is among the attributes and blessings of Allaah that He brings forth what is beautiful and conceals what is ugly. So openly flaunting sin is a rejection of that blessing and disrespect towards the concealment of Allaah. Al-Nawawi said: It is makrooh for the person who is tested with sin to tell anyone else about it. Rather he should give it up, regret it and resolve not to do it again. If he tells his shaykh or a similar person who he hopes can teach him a way out from it or show him how to keep himself from falling into similar sins, or can tell him the reason why he fell into it, or make du’aa’ for him, etc., this is fine. But is it makrooh (to tell someone else) if there is no benefit in doing so. Al-Ghazaali said: The kind of disclosure which is blameworthy is when it is in done by way of openly flaunting sin and mocking, not when it is done to ask questions and seek fatwas. The evidence for saying this is the report of the man who had intercourse with his wife in Ramadaan, and he came and told the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who did not rebuke him for telling him. (Fayd al-Qadeer, 5/11-12)
  The way out from your situation, is sincere repentance to Allaah, and not going to extremes in committing sins. If you do happen to commit a sin, do not tear away the covering with which Allaah conceals your sin. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

So it cannot be said that He is in Paradise. On the contrary, He is above the Throne which is the roof of Al-Firdaws, and Al-Firdaws is the highest part of Paradise.

There is no god worthy of worship but Allah, and Allah is Most Great. And peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions…
One of the things which it is obligatory to believe in is that Allah is the Most High (Al-`Ali, Al-A`la) and that He rose over the Throne, as He has told us about Himself in His Book. He, may He be Glorified and Exalted, is above all things. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in his Du`a: “You are the Most High (Adh-Dhahir) and there is nothing above You.”
We are also obliged to believe that He is the Most Great (Al-Kabir), and that He is greater than all things, and that He is the Almighty (Al-`Adhim), and there is nothing mightier than Him. Part of the perfection of His might and power is that He will grasp the heavens and the earth in His two Hands on the Day of Resurrection, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“They made not a just estimate of Allah such as is due to Him. And on the Day of Resurrection the whole of the earth will be grasped by His Hand and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand. Glorified be He, and High be He above all that they associate as partners with Him!” [Az-Zumar 39:62]
It must be noted that because Allah is perfect in His Highness and Power, He cannot reside in anything that He has created. So it cannot be said that He is in Paradise . On the contrary, He is above the Throne which is the roof of Al-Firdaws, and Al-Firdaws is the highest part of Paradise . The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When you ask Allah for Paradise, ask Him for Al-Firdaws, for it is the highest part of Paradise and it is in the best part of Paradise, and its roof is the Throne of the Most Merciful.”
It is not permissible for the Muslim to think about the essence of Allah, or to try to imagine His Might, for the human mind is incapable of comprehending the real essence and attributes of the Lord, and how they are. As Imam Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) said, when he was asked about how Allah rose over the Throne : “We know that He rose over it, but we do not know how.

9566,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9566,What is the difference between the ‘Arsh of the Lord and His  Kursiy?,What is the difference between Arsh and Kursi of Allah ?,,,"Praise be to Allah.The Kursiy is the footstool of the Most Merciful, according to the most correct of the scholarly opinions on the matter. The ‘Arsh (Throne) is the greatest of all things that Allaah has created, over which our Lord rose in  a manner that befits His Majesty. It has pillars and is carried by bearers who are angels of immense size.
 The evidence for the above is given below, along with the comments of some of the scholars.
It was narrated that Ibn Mas’ood said: Between the first heaven and the one above it is (a distance of) five hundred years. Between each of the heavens is (a distance of) five hundred years. Between the seventh heaven and the Kursiy is (a distance of) five hundred years. Between the Kursiy and the water is (a distance of) five hundred years, and the Throne is above the water. Allaah is above the Throne, and nothing whatsoever of your deeds is hidden from Him. (narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah in al-Tawheed, p. 105; by al-Bayhaqi in al-Asmaa’ wa’l-Sifaat, p. 401).
  This report was classed as saheeh by Ibn al-Qayyim in Ijtimaa’ al-Juyoosh al-Islamiyah, p. 100; by al-Dhahabi in al-‘Uluw, p. 64).
  Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said:
  This hadeeth stops at Ibn Mas’ood (it is mawqoof), but this is one of the matters concerning which there is no room for personal opinion, so it comes under the heading of marfoo’ [ahaadeeth whose isnaad goes back to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)], because Ibn Mas’ood is not known to have taken anything from the Israa’eeliyyaat [reports derived from Jewish sources].
(al-Qawl al-Mufeed Sharh Kitaab al-Tawheed, 3/379)
Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab said, in the list of points noted from this hadeeth:
.....(9)  The great size of the Kursiy in relation to the heavens.
(10)The great size of the Throne in relation to the Kursiy.
(11)That the Throne is something other than the Kursiy and the water.
(Sharh Kitaab al-Tawheed, p. 667, 668).
  The Throne of the Most Merciful is the greatest and most vast thing in His creation.
  Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“So Exalted be Allaah, the True King: Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Lord of the Supreme Throne!
[al-Mu’minoon 23:116]
“and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne” [al-Tawbah 9:129]
“Owner of the Throne, the Glorious” [al-Burooj 85:15]
 Al-Qurtubi said:
  The Throne is mentioned on its own because it is the greatest thing that Allaah has created; everything else is also included in this.
  (Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 8/302, 303).
  Ibn Katheer said:
“and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne” [al-Tawbah 9:129 – interpretation of the meaning] means, He is the Sovereign and Creator of all things, because He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne which is the roof of creation. All created things, the heavens and the earth and all that is in them and in between them are beneath the Throne of Allaah and are subject to His power. His knowledge encompasses all things and His power controls all things, and He is Watcher over all things.
  (Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 2/405)
  And he said (may Allaah have mercy on him):
“Owner of the Throne” [al-Burooj 85:15 – interpretation of the meaning] means, the Master of the Mighty Throne which is above all created things. “The Glorious” – there are two readings of this word (al-Majeed). If it is nominative (al-Majeedu) it is an adjective referring to the Lord, may He be glorified, and if it is genitive (al-Majeedi), it is an adjective referring to the Throne. Both meanings are correct.
  (Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 4/474).
Majeed means vast and mighty in power.
It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The people will fall unconscious on the Day of Resurrection; I will be the first to regain consciousness, and Moosa will be there, holding on to one of the pillars of the Throne. I do not know whether he woke up before me or if he was exempted because he had fallen unconscious at the Mount of Sinai.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3217)
The Throne has bearers who carry it.
  Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Those (angels) who bear the Throne (of Allaah) and those around it glorify the praises of their Lord, and believe in Him, and ask forgiveness for those who believe (in the Oneness of Allaah) (saying): ‘Our Lord! You comprehend all things in mercy and knowledge, so forgive those who repent and follow Your way, and save them from the torment of the blazing Fire!’”
[Ghaafir 40:7]
  They are of immense size:
  It was narrated from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
“I have been granted permission to speak about one of the angels of Allaah, one of the bearers of the Throne. The space between his earlobes and his shoulders is the distance of seven hundred years’ travelling.”
(Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4727)
Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said concerning this hadeeth: its isnaad meets the conditions of being saheeh.
  (Fath al-Baari, 8/665)
  The Throne is above the Kursiy, and is above all of creation. Ibn al-Qayyim said:
If Allaah is separate from His creation, then either He is encompassing them or He is not. If He is encompassing them, then He must be above them, because that which encompasses must necessarily be above that which is encompassed. Hence because the heavens encompass the earth, they must be above it, and because the Kursiy encompasses the heavens, it must be above them, and because the Throne encompasses the Kursiy, it must be above it. Whatever encompasses all of that must necessarily be above it. This does not imply that there is physical contact with anything that He encompasses; neither is there any similarity or resemblance between Him and that which He encompasses.
(al-Sawaa’iq al-Mursalah, 4/1308)
  The Throne is neither Sovereignty (al-Mulk) nor the Kursiy
  Ibn Abi’l-‘Izz al-Hanafi said:
  What would those who distort the word of Allaah and say that the Throne is an expression referring to al-Mulk or sovereignty say about the following aayat? –
“…and eight angels will, that Day, bear the Throne of your Lord above them” [al-Haaqqah 69:17 – interpretation of the meaning]
“…and His Throne was on the water…” [Hood 11:7 – interpretation of the meaning]
  Will they say that eight angels will, that Day, bear the Sovereignty of Allaah, and that His Sovereignty was on the water? Will Moosa be holding on to one of the pillars of Allaah’s sovereignty? Can any same person who knows what he is saying utter such things?
  Concerning the Kursiy, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“His Kursiy extends over the heavens and the earth” [al-Baqarah 2:255]
 It was said that this is the Throne, but the correct view is that it is something else. This was transmitted from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both) and others. Ibn Abi Shaybah narrated in Sifat al-‘Arsh, and al-Haakim narrated in his Mustadrak that [the following  report] meets the conditions of the two Shaykhs [al-Bukhaari and Muslim] although they did not narrate it: (it was reported from) from Sa’eed ibn Jubayr that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said, concerning the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“His Kursiy extends over the heavens and the earth” [al-Baqarah 2:255]:
 The Kursiy is the footstool, and no one can comprehend how vast the Throne is except Allaah.
This was transmitted as a marfoo’ report (attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)), but the correct view is that it is mawqoof, stopping at Ibn ‘Abbaas…
Abu Dharr (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “The Kursiy in relation to the Throne is like an iron ring thrown out into empty land.”
And, as one of the Salaf said, before the Throne it is like a step.
  (Sharh al-‘Aqeedah al-Tahhaawiyyah, p. 312, 313).
  Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said:
  There are those who say that the Kursiy is the Throne because of the hadeeth, “Allaah will set up His Kursiy on the Day of Resurrection.” They think that the Kursiy is the Throne.
  Similarly, some people claim that the Kursiy is Allaah’s knowledge, and say that the aayah (interpretation of the meaning)
“His Kursiy extends over the heavens and the earth” [al-Baqarah 2:255] refers to His Knowledge.
  The correct view is that the Kursiy is a footstool, and the Throne is that which the Most Merciful rose above (istiwaa’). And knowledge is the attribute of the knowledgeable one by means of which he understands that which he knows.

9571,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9571,What is the meaning of the hadith “Do not inveigh against time (waqt) for Allah is time waqt)”?,"Is the saying ""Do not curse time for Allah is time"" authentic from the Rasool's sayings ? If so, how do you interpret this ? I am confused about this issue.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The word used in the hadith is not waqt (= time), but dahr (= time, vicissitudes of time) [this element of confusion may stem from translation of the question into Arabic]. This hadith was narrated by Muslim (5827) from Abu Hurayrah.
 Other versions of the hadith are:
“Do not inveigh against time (al-dahr), for Allah is time”
“Let not any one of you say, ‘Woe to time,’ for Allah is time”
“Allah says, ‘The sons of Adam offend Me and say, Woe to time, but they should not say Woe to time. I am time, I alternate the night and the day, and if I willed, I could seize them both.’”
 With regard to the meaning of the hadith, al-Nawawi said:
 They said: this is a metaphor, because the Arabs used to inveigh against time when disasters such as death, old age, loss of money, etc., happened. They would say, ‘Woe to time’ and other phrases cursing or inveighing against time. So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Do not inveigh against time for Allah is time’, i.e., do not inveigh against the One Who brings about those disasters, for that will be directed towards Allah, for He is the One Who causes them to happen. Time (al-dahr) means al-zamaan (time) which cannot do anything in and of itself, for it is just one of the things that have been created by Allah.
The meaning of the phrase “for Allah is time” means that He is the One Who causes those events and accidents to happen, and He is the Creator of all that happens. And Allah knows best. (Sharh Muslim, 15/3)
It should be noted that “time” (al-dahr) is not one of the Names of Allah; it is attributed to Allah in the sense that He created it and is controlling it, i.e., He is the Creator of time. Some phrases in the same hadith also indicate this, as when He says,“It is in My Hand, I alternate the night and the day.” The One Who alternates and the thing which is alternated cannot be one and the same; there is the One Who alternates – i.e., Allah – and the thing which is alternated – i.e., time, which Allah controls as and when He wills.
 See: Fatawa al-‘Aqeedah by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 1/163
 Al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer said, in his Tafseer of the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“And they say: “There is nothing but our life of this world, we die and we live and nothing destroys us except Ad‑Dahr (time)” [al-Jaathiyah 45:24]
Al-Shaafa'i, Abu ‘Ubaydah and others said, in their commentary on the hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Do not inveigh against time for Allah is time” – During the Jaahiliyyah, if some difficulty, trial or disaster befell them, the Arabs wouldsay ‘Woe to time’, attributing those events to time and inveighing against it. But the One Who brought those events to pass is Allah, so it was as if they were inveighing against Allah, may He be glorified, because in fact He was the One Who caused those things to happen. So it was forbidden to inveigh against time in this manner, because Allah is Time, i.e., He is the One lWho is controlling it, but the Arabs were attributing those events to Time.
This is the best of the comments made in the Tafseer of this hadith, and this is what is meant. And Allah knows best. (Tafseer Ibn Kather, 4/152)
 Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah preserve him) was asked about the ruling on inveighing against time. He replied:
 Inveighing against time may be divided into three categories:
 1.Where the intention is to convey information without blaming or condemning. This is permissible, such as when a person remarks, “We are suffering from the heat (or the cold) today” and the like, because deeds are judged according to their intentions, and in this case a person is merely describing what is happening without expressing discontent.
2.Where a person inveighs against time as the cause of events, as if by inveighing against it he means that time is what causes things to alternate between good and bad. This is shirk akbar (major form of shirk) because when a person attributes events to something other than Allah, this means that he believes that there is another creator alongside Allah.
3.Where a person inveighs against time but believes that the One who causes things to happen is Allah, but he inveighs against time because of the bad things that happened. This is haram because it is contrary to the sabr (patience) that is required, but it is not kufr because the person does not inveigh directly against Allah. If he were to inveigh directly against Allah, he would be a kaafir. (Fatawa al-‘Aqeedah, 1/197)
 Other reprehensible expressions which people utter include cursing the hour or the day on which a certain bad thing happened, and so on. This is a sin because it is cursing and improper speech, and because this is cursing something which does not deserve to be cursed. What has the hour or the day done wrong? Nothing apart from the fact that the events happened then, but they are only created things which have no control over anything and cannot be held to blame. If a person inveighs against time, this reflects on the Creator of time. The Muslim should be above speaking in such a foolish and improper manner.

9574,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9574,Frightening dreams,"I am a young sister who got married recently to a man with very good character and deen, masha-Allah. Since I have got married, I frequently have very frightening dreams about my husband and others I love.
Before marriage I never had frightening dreams as I always make my adhkaar at bedtime. Sometimes I see that there are jinns inside other people and I am trying to fight them by reciting ayatul-Kursi, but they are stopping me from doing so. I cannot sleep at night and wake up several times. One good sister suggested to me that it may be the evil eye brought on by others who are jealous. If that is the case, then please could you guide me as to what I can do about this problem as it is very distressing.
May Allah Reward you greatly for your advice.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Undoubtedly the frightening dreams that this sister sees are from the accursed Shaytaan who is trying his hardest to prevent people from following the true religion and keep them away from their Lord Whom they worship, and he wants to cause grief to the believers. But his plots against the pious close friends of Allaah are weak and insignificant, especially against those who fortify themselves with ruqya as prescribed in sharee’ah day and night. 
Secondly: 
You should note that the best way in which the Muslim can protect himself against the Shaytaan is to remember Allaah. According to the hadeeth narrated by al-Tirmidhi (2863), Allaah commanded Yahya ibn Zakariyya (peace be upon him) to tell the Children of Israel to do five things, including the following: 
“I command you to remember Allaah, for the likeness of that is that of a man whose enemy comes after him, until he comes to a strong fortress where he protects himself from him. Similarly, a person cannot protect himself against the Shaytaan except by remembering Allaah.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmdihi. 
If the Muslim fears Allaah in all his affairs, and adheres to that which Allaah has commanded and avoids that which He has forbidden, and he constantly remembers Allaah, praying and fasting and other kinds of worship, and he fortifies himself by reading Qur’aan night and day, out loud and silently, and he regularly recites the wirds and dhikrs prescribed in Islam for the morning and evening, and when eating, drinking, getting dressed and going to sleep, then the Shaytaan will go away from him, blameworthy and defeated, and will have no power to do anything to him. How can it be otherwise when Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Those who believe, fight in the Cause of Allaah, and those who disbelieve, fight in the cause of Taaghoot (Satan). So fight you against the friends of Shaytaan (Satan); ever feeble indeed is the plot of Shaytaan (Satan)”
[al-Nisa’ 4:76]? 
The Shaytaan only comes close to those who are far away from their religion and Qur’aan. The Shaytaan may try to divert the righteous from the straight path, in order to ruin their lives and religious commitment and worldly interests. But protection may be sought against him in the manner described above. You can also refer to the books of dhikr such as al-Adhkaar by al-Nawawi; ‘Aml al-Yawm wa’l-Laylah by al-Nasaa’i; ‘Aml al-Yawm wa’l-Laylah by Ibn al-Sunni; and other books of dhikr that deal with this topic, or books of Sunan in general. If you do that we hope that your situation will improve and you will find peace of mind, and Allaah will change your situation to a better one. 
Among the dhikrs with which we advise you to recite regularly are the following: 
1 – Adhkaar for morning and evening. 
(a)Reciting every evening the words, “A’oodhu bi kalimaat Allaah il-taammah min sharri ma khalaqa (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allaah from the evil of that which He has created).”
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of Allaah, I am suffering because of a scorpion that stung me yesterday.” He said, “If you had said in the evening, A’oodhu bi kalimaat Allaah il-taammah min sharri ma khalaqa (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allaah from the evil of that which He has created),’ it would not have harmed you. 
Narrated by Muslim. 
Indeed, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) encouraged us to say that in every place where we stop (when travelling). 
It was narrated that Khawlah bint Hakeem al-Salamiyyah said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “Whoever makes a stop in some place, then says, ‘A’oodhu bi kalimaat Allaah il-taammah min sharri ma khalaqa (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allaah from the evil of that which He has created),’ nothing will harm him until he moves on from that place.” 
Narrated by Muslim, 2708. 
(b)It was narrated that ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no person who says in the morning and evening of each day, ‘Bismillaah illaahi laa yadurru ma’a ismihi shay’un fi’l-ard wa la fi’l-sama’ wa huwa al-samee’ ul-‘aleem (In the name of Allaah with Whose name nothing is harmed on earth nor in heaven, and He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing)’ three times, but nothing will harm him.”
Narrated and classed as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi, 3388; also narrated by Ibn Maajah, 3869. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. 
(c)Reciting Aayat al-Kursiy and al-Mu’awwidhaat before going to sleep.
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) put me in charge of guarding the zakaah of Ramadaan. Someone came to me and started grabbing handfuls of the food. I took hold of him and said, ‘I will take you to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).’ He said, ‘I will teach you some words by means of which Allaah will benefit you.’ I said, ‘What are they?’ He said, ‘When you go to your bed, recite this aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “Allaah! Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), Al-Hayyul-Qayyoom (the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists)…” [al-Baqarah 2:255] – until he completed the aayah. Then Allaah will appoint a guard for you who will stay with you and no shaytaan (devil) will come near you until morning.’ The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked me, ‘What did your prisoner do last night?’ I said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, he taught me something, and claimed that Allaah would benefit me by it.’ He said, ‘What was it?’ I said, ‘He taught me to recite Aayat al-Kursiy when I go to bed, and said that no shaytaan would come near me until morning, and that Allaah would appoint a guard for me who would stay with me.’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ‘He told you the truth, although he is an inveterate liar. That was the Shaytaan.’”
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3101; Muslim, 505. 
There are many such dhikrs; we do not have room to mention them all here. 
Thirdly: 
With regard to the hasad (envy) and the evil eye of which you speak, it may be that this harm has come to you through hasad. Protection against that is to be sought by reciting the dhikrs prescribed in sharee’ah.
It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to seek refuge with Allaah for al-Hasan and al-Husayn. He said: ‘Your father [i.e., Ibraaheem] used to seek refuge with Allaah for Ismaa’eel and Ishaaq with these words: A’oodhu bi kalimaat Allaah al-taammah min kulli shaytaanin wa haammah wa min kulli ‘aynin laammah (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allaah, from every devil and every poisonous reptile, and from every bad eye).’”
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3191. 
With regard to the remedy:
It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The evil eye is real, and if anything were to overtake the divine decree (al-qadar) it would be the evil eye. When you are asked to take a bath (to provide a cure) from the influence of the evil eye, you should take a bath”
Narrated by Muslim, 2188.
If you know that the evil eye has been put on you by a certain person, then you should ask him to do ghusl and wudoo’, then you should pour the water of his ghusl or wudoo’ over yourself. The way in which this should be done has been explained by Ibn al-Qayyim, who said:
In Sunan Abi Dawood it is narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: The ‘aa’in (the one who put the evil eye on another) would be ordered to do wudoo’, then the ma’een (the one on whom he had put the evil eye) would do ghusl with that water. 
In al-Saheehayn it is narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded me or he commanded us to recite ruqyah for protection against the evil eye.”
Al-Tirmidhi narrated from Sufyaan ibn ‘Uyayanah from ‘Amr ibn Dinaar from ‘Urwah ibn ‘Aamir from ‘Ubayd ibn Rafaa’ah al-Sarqi that Asma’ bint Umays said: “O Messenger of Allaah, the children of Ja’far have been afflicted by the evil eye, shall we recite ruqyah for them?” He said, “Yes, for if anything were to overtake the divine decree it would be the evil eye.” Al-Tirmidhi said: a saheeh hasan hadeeth. Then he mentioned the hadeeth which described how ‘Aamir ibn Rabee’ah afflicted Sahl ibn Hunayf with his eye, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded ‘Aamir to do ghusl.
So he washed his face, hands, forearms, knees and the sides of his feet, and inside his izaar (lower garment) in the vessel. Then that water was poured over him, and a man poured it over his head and back from behind. He did that to him, then Sahl got up and joined the people.

Du’a for Nightmares


What to do when you have a bad dream","Praise be to Allah.Bad dreams are from Satan
Dreams that disturb a person and keep him awake come from the Shaytan. In general, the dreams that people see are either good dreams which come from Allah, a reflection of things which a person is thinking about, or a third type, which are dreams that come from the Shaytan. 
Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Towards the end of time, hardly any dreams that the Muslim sees will not come true. The one whose dreams are the most truthful will be the one whose speech is the most honest. The dreams of the Muslim form one of the forty-five parts of Prophecy. Dreams are of three types: the good dream which is good news from Allah; dreams which cause distress, which come from the Shaytan; and dreams concerning matters which a person is thinking about…” (Narrated by Muslim, 2263) 
Du’a for Nightmares
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us how to rid ourselves of the influence of Shaytan during sleep. This can be achieved by reciting verses from the Quran and du’as narrated from him before going to sleep .

Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) put me in charge of guarding the zakah of Ramadan. Someone came and started to scatter the food. I took hold of him and said, ‘I will take you to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).’… He said, ‘When you go to bed, recite Ayat al-Kursi and you will be protected by Allah, and no shaytan (devil) will come near you until morning.’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘He told you the truth even though he is a liar. That was a shaytan.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3101)
Abu Mas'ud al-Badri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The last two ayahs of Surah al-Baqarah – whoever recites them at night, they will be sufficient for him.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3786; Muslim,807).

Al-Nawawi said: “Concerning the phrase, ‘The last two ayahs of Surah al-Baqarah – whoever recites them at night, they will be sufficient for him’, it was said that it means, they will be sufficient for him instead of praying qiyam al-layl, or as protection from Shaytan, or as protection from vermin. It could mean all of these things.” (Sharh Muslim, 6/91, 92).

 ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went to his bed, he would blow into his hands and recite Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad (Surah 112) and the Mu'awwidhatayn (Surahs 113 and 114). Then he would wipe his hands over his face and his body, as far as they could reach.” ‘Aishah said: “When he fell ill, He would ask me to do that for him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5416; Muslim, 2192) 
Abu Hurayrah said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to tell us, when any one of us wanted to sleep, to lie on his right side, then say ‘Allahumma Rabb al-samawati wa Rabb al-ard wa Rabb al-‘Arsh il-‘Azim, Rabbana wa Rabba kulli shay-in, faliq al-habb wa’l-nawa wa munazzil al-Tawrati wa’l-Injeeli wa’l-Furqan, a’udhu bika min sharri kulli shay-in anta akhidhun bi nasiyatihi. Allahumma anta al-awwal fa laysa qablaka shay-un, wa anta al-akhir fa laysa ba’daka shay-un. Wa anta al-zahir fa laysa fawqaka shay-un wa anta al-batin fa laysa dunaka shay-un. Iqdi ‘anna al-dayna wa aghnina min al-faqr (O Allah, Lord of the heavens and the earth, and Lord of the Mighty Throne, our Lord and Lord of all things, Splitter of the seed and the date stone, Revealer of the Tawrat, the Injil and the Furqan, I seek refuge in You from the evil of all things that You will seize by the forelock [i.e., have full control over them]. O Allah, You are the First and there is nothing before You; You are the Last and there is nothing after You. You are the Manifest (al-Zahir) and there is nothing above You; You are the Hidden (al-Batin) and there is nothing beyond You. Settle our debt and spare us from poverty).’” (Narrated by Muslim, 2713) 
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Abu Bakr said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, teach me something that I can say in the morning and in the evening.’ He said: ‘Say, Allahumma ‘Alim al-ghaybi wa’l-shahadah, Fatir al-samawati wa’l-ard, Rabba kulli shay-in wa malikahu, ashhadu an la ilaha illa anta. A'oodhu bika min sharri nafsi wa min sharr il-shaitan wa shirkih (O Allah, Knower of the seen and the unseen, Creator of the heavens and the earth, Lord and Sovereign of all things, I bear witness that there is no god except You. I seek refuge in You from the evil of my own self and from the evil and shirk of the Shaytan). Say this in the morning and in the evening, and when you go to bed.’” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3392; Abu Dawud, 5067).

What to do when you have a bad dream
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also taught us what to do when someone sees something unpleasant in a dream and wakes up as a result. That is: to spit dryly to the left, to seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytan, to change the side on which one was sleeping, and to pray if one wishes.

Abu Qatadah said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Good dreams come from Allah and bad dreams come from the Shaytan. If any one of you sees a bad dream which makes him afraid, let him spit dryly to his left and seek refuge with Allah from its evil, then it will not harm him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3118; Muslim, 2261).
Jabir reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If any one of you sees a dream that he dislikes, let him spit dryly to his left three time, and seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytan three times, and change the side on which he was sleeping.” (narrated by Muslim, 2262).
Abu Hurayrah said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘If any one of you sees something that he dislikes (in a dream), let him get up and pray, and not tell people about it.’” (narrated by Muslim, 2263)

 If the Muslim follows this advice given by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), before he goes to bed, it is hoped that no shaytan will come anywhere near him, and if he follows this advice when he wakes up from a bad dream, it will take away all anxiety and distress from him.

What if a brother wants to pray istikhaarah concerning a compulsory action,
because I did not understand what was meant by the Arabic word “kullihaa” (all of them). Does this mean all, or the majority? Because in Arabic, as far as I know, the word “kull” may mean “the majority”. Please,
      yaa shaykh, clarify for me the meaning of the word “kullihaa” and
      whether one can pray salat al-istikaarah concerning compulsory actions.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There
      is no option when it comes to doing obligatory actions, because Allaah has
      enjoined them upon us. The same applies to abstaining from haraam things.
      There is no sense in praying istikhaarah concerning matters which we have
      no choice about doing. Salat al-istikhaarah was not prescribed for this
      purpose. Istikhaarah is for permissible matters where one needs to choose
      the better of two options, or when one has many permissible options. So
      one prays istikhaarah in order to choose one particular permissible thing,
      when one is confused as to which city to go to in order to seek knowledge,
      or which shaykh one should study with, or which halaqah one should attend.
      So you consult people, then you pray istikhaarah concerning the one that
      you think is more likely to be better. Similarly, you pray istikhaarah
      when you plan to propose marriage to a specific woman, or when deciding
      whether to do a naafil Hajj this year or next year, or when deciding about

His excuse for his doing was that he can not stand being ""ripped off"". Now, two weeks ago he rented a suit for our friend's wedding, and after went to another shop to buy a shirt and a tie. He found a shirt and a tie in a package and when he decided to buy it he was accused by sales assistant of putting these two together in order to get a cheaper price and this was not true. Therefore he got very angry and in order to ""punish"" the company, stole a $900 suit, and left to the same company other suit that he rented for $50. I explained for him that this is haraam, and that there is no excuse for stealing. He is not a thief. He is a very strict Muslim. Please tell me how to explain to him that in Islam stealing is stealing no matter of the situations. Please answer me, I would really appreciate it.",,,"Praise be to Allah.1.We are surprised at your 
          husband’s actions which you have told us about, and we are amazed that 
          you describe him as not being  a thief and as being a committed 
          Muslim, when he has done something which the rank-and-file of Muslims 
          – let alone their scholars – know full well to be haraam. 
  
          We have nothing that we can advise you to tell him, apart from the ruling 
          on stealing, and that it is haraam, and that Allaah says in His mighty 
          Book (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And 
          (as for) the male thief and the female thief, cut off (from the wrist 
          joint) their (right) hands as a recompense for that which they committed, 
          a punishment by way of example from Allaah…” 
[al-Maa’idah 
          5:38] 
The 
          punishment for stealing in sharee’ah is cutting off the right hand, 
          and the thief is still not free from blame after the punishment has 
          been carried out, until he restores the stolen property to its rightful 
          owner.
  
          Allaah also says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And 
          eat up not one another’s property unjustly (in any illegal way, e.g. 
          stealing, robbing, deceiving)”
[al-Baqarah 
          2:188] 
It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas 
          (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) addressed the people on 
          the Day of Sacrifice and said:
  
          “O people, what day is this?” They said: “A sacred day.” He said, “What 
          land is this?” They said, “A sacred land.” He said, “What month is this?” 
          They said, “A sacred month.” He said: “Your blood, your wealth and your 
          honour are sacred to you, just as this day of yours in this land of 
          yours in this month of yours is sacred” – and he repeated it several 
          times. Then he raised his head and said, “O Allaah, have I conveyed 
          it? O Allaah, have I conveyed it?” Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased 
          with them both) said: 
“By 
          the one in Whose hand is my soul, it was advice given to his ummah, 
          so let the one who was present convey it to the one who was absent.” 
          (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1652). 
  
          A similar report was narrated in al-Saheehayn 
          from Abu Bakrah. 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah 
          said: A man came to the Messenger of Allaah  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of 
          Allaah, what do you think if a man comes to take my wealth?” He said, 
          “Do not give him your wealth.” He said, “What if he fights me?” He said, 
          “Fight him back.” He said, “What if he kills me?” He said, “Then you 
          will be a shaheed (martyr).” He said, “What if I kill him?” He said, 
          “He will be in the Fire (Hell).” (Narrated by Muslim, 140)
  
          It was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah cursed the 
          thief who steals an egg and has his hand cut off, and steals a rope 
          and has his hand cut off.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6401; Muslim, 1687). 
          
  
          If he thinks that this is permissible for him, then he has been cheated. 
          This is the deception of the Shaytaan. A haraam action should not be 
          met with another haraam action. 
  
          This is if we accept what he said.  But in principle the vendor 
          has the right to sell (his goods) for whatever price he wants. The Prophet 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) said: “The buyer and seller have the choice (of either 
          going ahead with or cancelling the transaction) so long as they have 
          not parted.” (Narrated in al-Bukhaari, 1973; Muslim, 1532) If he [your 
          husband] does not like the price of an item, all he has to do is negotiate; 
          he should not steal. If he likes the price, fair enough; otherwise he 
          should go to a different store. 
  
          As for his “punishing” the store by stealing 900 dollars, this is also 
          haraam. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And 
          if you punish (your enemy, O you believers in the Oneness of Allâh), 
          then punish them with the like of that with which you were afflicted” 
          [al-Nahl 16:126]
  
          A person does not have the right to take whatever wants even if he has 
          been mistreated. If he takes more than what has been taken from him 
          unlawfully, then he becomes a wrongdoer too. 
  
          This is if the store has done wrong by your husband, but what seems 
          to be the case is the opposite. It is no more than the matter of misplaced 
          suspicion. Would your husband like it if someone were to do that to 
          him, and steal even half of this amount just because he suspects him? 
          
  
          The answer, obviously, would be no. So it is not permissible for him 
          to do that to this storekeeper. 
  
          We advise you to tell him that this world is fleeting, and that man 
          will meet Allaah on the Day of Resurrection with his deeds, and that 
          theft is a scandal and a humiliation in this world and the next. 
  
          In this world, it removes the blessing from the thief’s property, and 
          indeed from his life, then it brings him humiliation among people. 
  
          In the Hereafter it will be even worse. Let him think about this hadeeth: 
          
  
          It was narrated that Abu Humayd al-Saa’idi said: The Messenger of Allaah 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) said: 
“By 
          Allaah, none of you takes something from another unlawfully, but he 
          will meet Allaah carrying it on the Day of Resurrection. I shall see 
          some of you meeting Allaah carrying a camel grunting, or a cow mooing, 
          or a sheep bleating.” Then he raised his arm so high that the whiteness 
          of his armpit became visible, and said, “O Allaah, have I conveyed it?”

      property except the father.

      smaller share than many other heirs, which proves that the son is the
      owner of his own wealth, not the father.
(al-Risaalah,
      p. 468)
4.This
      permission is not absolute. It is subject to four conditions.
       
      
      Shaykh
      Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah preserve him) said:
This
      hadeeth is not da’eef (weak) because it has corroborating reports. What
      this means is that if he (the son) has wealth, the father has the right to
      enjoy that wealth and to take whatever he wants from it, but this is
      subject to certain conditions:
 The
      first condition: that by taking it he does not cause harm to his son. If
      it does cause harm – such as taking his cover with which he protects
      himself from the cold, or he takes his food with which he wards off hunger
      –it is not permissible for the father to do this.
The
      second condition: it should not be something that the son needs. If the
      son has a concubine whom he sleeps with, it is not permissible for the
      father to take her, because his son needs her. Similarly, if the son has a
      car which he needs for getting about, and he does not have enough cash to
      buy a replacement, then the father does not have the right to take it
      under any circumstances.
The
      third condition: he should not take the wealth from one of his sons in
      order to give it to another, because this creates enmity between the sons
      and because it means preferring one of the children over another, if the
      second son is not in need. If he is in need, then the father’s giving
      something to the one who is in need and not to the ones who are not in
      need, does not mean that he is preferring one child over another; on the
      contrary, it is obligatory for him to do this.
Whatever
      the case, the hadeeth is something which the scholars refer to and use as
      evidence. But there are conditions attached, as we have mentioned. The
      father does not have the right to take one son’s wealth and give it to
      another son.
      
      
      And Allaah knows best.
       
      
      (Fataawa
      Islamiyyah,4/108, 109)
      
      
      There is also a fourth condition, which is that the father should be in
      need of the wealth that he is taking from his son. This condition is
      clearly stated in some ahaadeeth.
      
      
      It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said:
      the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
      said: “Your children are a gift from Allaah to you: ‘He
      bestows female (offspring) upon whom He wills, and bestows male
      (offspring) upon whom He wills’ [al-Shoora 42:49 – interpretation of
      the meaning]. So they and their wealth are for you, if you have
      need of it.”
      
      
      (narrated by al-Haakim, 2/284; al-Bayhaqi, 7/480)
      
      
      The hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah
      al-Saheehah, 2564, where he says:
      
      
      This hadeeth contains an important fiqhi point which is that it explains
      that the famous hadeeth, “You and your wealth are for your father” (al-Irwaa’
      838) does not give the father absolute permission to take whatever he
      wants from his son’s wealth. Far from it! But he may take whatever he is
      in need of.

9596,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9596,Ruling on praying behind someone who smokes cigarettes and the narghile,"We have six classes each day, then we pray Zuhr and we have various people who lead us in prayer. Some of them smoke cigarettes, some smoke the narghile (“hubble-bubble”), and some grow their hair long. What is the ruling on these people leading the prayer? Is it permissible to pray behind them?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, 
          the prayer is valid, but it is better to appoint as your imaam the one 
          who reads the Qur’aan best, and who has the best understanding of Islam. 
          That is better, because the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Let the people appoint 
          as their imaam the one amongst them who reads the Qur’aan best.” (Narrated 
          by Muslim, no. 673). The meaning 
          of the one who reads the Qur’aan best is the one who reads it and acts 
          in accordance with it, because there is nothing good in reading it and 
          not acting in accordance with it. If the people appoint a person to 
          be the imaam, and among the congregation there is someone who reads 
          the Qur’aan better than he does, that is not right, as implied in the 
          hadeeth. 
 Imaam 
          Ahmad mentioned in his book Risaalat 
          al-Sunniyah: If a person leads people in prayer and among 
          them there is someone who is better than him, they will be in a state 
          of decline. So it is better for you to be led in prayer by the one who 
          is most pious, who has the best understanding of Islam and who has the 
          most knowledge of the Qur’aan. But if we suppose that this man who smokes 
          cigarettes or who shaves his beard or who smokes the narghile or who 
          grows his hair long comes forward and leads you in prayer, we say: the 
          prayer is valid, and you do not need to repeat it, because he is Muslim, 
          but the prayer is imperfect.

          Allaah knows best.","Fataawa Samaahat al-Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Humayd, p. 127"
