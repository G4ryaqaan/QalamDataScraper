My question:  What exactly are my responsibilities toward him?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not obligatory for a woman to serve her husband’s father or mother, or any of his relatives. But it is the matter of chivalry and good manners, if she is in the house, to serve his parents. But with regard to forcing her to do that, it is not permissible for her husband to force her to do that, and it is not a duty upon her. What I suggest is that the wife should be patient in serving her husband’s father, and know that this will not do her any harm; in fact it will make her more noble and more loved by her husband. And Allaah is the Source of strength.","Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen /Fataawa al-‘Ulamaa’ fi ‘Ushrat al-Nisaa’ wa Hall al-Mushkilaat, 128"

I love him very much but my parents disapprove of this marriage for the following reasons. They think I am too young. They think that he (we) will not be able to support ourselves since both of us are students. They want me to finish school (i am in my last year of high school) and maybe even finish university before getting married for they think that is i get married i will not complete my studies. Please advise me on what i should do and what right i have in this.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah mercy on him) was asked a 
    similar question and said: 
The ruling on that is that it is contrary to the command of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If there comes to you one with whose 
    religious commitment and character you are pleased, then marry [your daughter or female relative under your care] to him.” Undoubtedly your 
    father’s preventing you from marrying one who is suitable is something that is haraam. Marriage is more important than study, and it does not mean 
    that you cannot study, because the two can be combined. What I advise my brothers who are the guardians of women to do, is to let them complete 
    their studies; a woman may stipulate as a condition of her marriage that she be able to continue studying until her studies are complete. 
Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 2/704-705. 
Secondly: 
With regard to what you mention about the situation of the one who has proposed 
    marriage and that he is still a student, being a student is not regarded as an impediment to marriage if he can afford to get married and to spend 
    on his wife on a reasonable basis. 
But if his being a student means that he cannot afford to get married and spend on 
    his wife – apart from the unreasonable demands that some families make in the conditions that they stipulate – this is addressed by the words of 
    Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves 
    chaste, until Allaah enriches them of His Bounty”
[al-Noor 24:33]
Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: In this verse, Allaah commands everyone who is 
    unable to get married and cannot find any means of doing so to keep himself chaste, because the most common obstacle to marriage is lack of money. 
    So Allaah promises independence of means by His bounty, so that He will provide what one needs to get married or to find a woman who will accept a 
    small mahr, or else remove from him the desire to marry.” Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 12/242 
It should be noted that the mahr and maintenance are the rights of the woman, not 
    of her guardians. She has the right to agree to a little and to marry one whom she knows is poor, but it has to be pointed out that many woman may 
    agree to marry a man even though he is poor when he proposes to her, then shortly after marriage the woman may start to complain, and that leads 
    to arguments and divorce. This should be taken into consideration. 
Thirdly: 
We advise families and guardians not to be an obstacle to keeping their daughters 
    and female relatives chaste because of the unreasonable conditions that they stipulate regarding spending on the basis that they want to be 
    reassured about their daughters’ future. This puts off the men who want to marry them, which leads to them being left on the shelf and the evils 
    that result from that, especially nowadays when fitnah (temptation) is so widespread. Thus they harm themselves and their daughters when their 
    intention is to do good. 
We ask Allaah to set the affairs of the Muslims straight. 
And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A

Hadiths about the death of the Dajjal","Praise be to Allah.Meaning of the word Masih (Messiah)
There are over fifty scholarly comments on the meaning of the word Masih (Messiah). They said that this word is applied both to the Truthful One [True Messiah, i.e., ‘Isa (Jesus)] and to the misleading liar [the “antichrist” or Dajjal]. 
The Messiah is the Truthful One, ‘Isa ibn Maryam (Jesus the son of Mary), the Messiah of guidance, who healed those who were born blind and lepers, and brought the dead to life by Allah’s Leave. 
The false messiah (al-Masih al-Dajjal) is the liar who leads people astray, the messiah of misguidance who will tempt people by means of the signs that he is given, such as bringing down rain, reviving the earth to bring forth vegetation, and other “miracles.” 
So Allah has created two messiahs, who are opposites of one another. 
Why the Dajjal is called masih 
The scholars said that the reason why the Dajjal is called masih (a “messiah”) is because one of his eyes is mamsuh (lit. “wiped”; smooth or abraded, i.e., he will be blind or defective in one eye). Or it was said that it is because he will survey or travel throughout the earth (yamsah) in forty days… The former view is more correct, because of what was said in the hadith narrated by Muslim (no. 5221) from Anas ibn Malik, who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The Dajjal will be blind (mamsuh) in one eye, and between his eyes will be written ‘kafir’…’”. 
Meaning of the word Dajjal
The word Dajjal is taken from the expression “Dajjala al-ba’eer (he smeared the camel)”, referring to when they covered it with tar. 
The root dajala means to mix. The word dajala is used to mean deliberately confusing matters and being vague and ambiguous, The Dajjal is the one who speaks in vagaries, who tells many lies and deceives many people. 
The word “Dajjal” became a title given to the lying, one-eyed, false messiah. The Dajjal is so called because he will conceal his kufr from the people by lying to them, deceiving them and confusing them. 
Description of the Dajjal, and the ahadith narrated concerning him
The Dajjal will be a man from among the sons of Adam. He will have many attributes which were described in the ahadith to acquaint people with him and to warn them of his evil. 
So when he comes, the believers will know him and will not be misled by him. They will know his features which the Truthful One (the Prophet) (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has told us about. 
These features will distinguish him from other people, so that no one will be deceived by him except those who are ignorant and whose doom has already been decreed. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound. 
Attributes of the Dajjal
Among these attributes are: 
He will be a young man with a ruddy complexion, short, with thick curly hair, a wide forehead, and broad upper chest, blind or defective (mamsuh) in the right eye. This eye will be neither prominent nor sunken, and will look like a floating grape. 
His left eye will be covered with a thick piece of flesh growing at the edge of his eye. Written between his eyes will be “Kaf fa ra (K-F-R)”, in separate (Arabic) letters, or “kafir”, with the letters joined. This will be read by every Muslim, literate or illiterate. 
Another of his characteristics will be that he will be sterile, with no children born to him. 
Hadiths about the Dajjal
There follow some of the sahih ahadith in which the above attributes are mentioned. These ahadeeth form part of the evidence (dalil) concerning the emergence of the Dajjal  :
1- From ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Whilst I was sleeping, I saw myself performing Tawaf around the Ka’bah, when I saw a dark man with straight hair, standing between two other men, with water dripping from his head. I asked, “Who is this?” They said, “The son of Maryam.” Then I turned and saw a ruddy-complexioned man, well built, with curly hair, blind in his right eye, with his eye looking like a floating grape. I asked, “Who is this?” They said, “This is the Dajjal.” The person who looks most like him is Ibnu Qatan.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, no. 6508; Ibn Qatan was a man from Banu Mustalaq from Khuza'ah). 
2- It was also narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) mentioned the Dajjal to the people and said: “Allah is not one-eyed, but the false messiah (al-Masih al-Dajjal) is one-eyed, blind or defective in his right eye, with his eye looking like a floating grape…” (narrated by al-Bukhari, no. 3184).
3- In the lengthy hadith narrated by al-Nawwas ibn Sam’an (may Allah be pleased with him) it says: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) mentioned the Dajjal one morning. Sometimes he described him as insignificant and sometimes he described him as so significant that we thought that he was in the cluster of date-palm trees…” One of the features of the Dajjal that he described was: “He will be a young man with very curly hair, with his eye floating. It is as if he looks like ‘Abd al-‘Uzza ibn Qatan.” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 5228) 
4- It was narrated from ‘Ubadah ibn al-Samit (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have told you so much about the Dajjal that I fear you will not understand. The Dajjal will be a short man, pigeon-toed, with curly hair. He will be one-eyed, with his eye neither prominent nor sunken. If you become confused about him, then remember that your Lord is not one-eyed.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, no. 3763. This hadith is sahih – Sahih al-Jami’ al-Saghir, no. 2455). 
5- Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘… as for the false messiah, he will be one-eyed, with a wide forehead and broad upper chest, and he will be hunchbacked…’” (Narrated by Ahmad, no. 7564). 
6- Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The Dajjal will be one-eyed, blind or defective in his left eye, with thick hair. He will have with him a paradise and a hell, but his hell will be a paradise and his paradise will be a hell.’” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 5222). 
7- According to the hadith of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No Prophet was sent but he warned his people about the one-eyed liar. He is one-eyed, but your Lord is not one-eyed, and between his eyes will be written ‘kafir.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, no. 6598). According to another report: “Written between his eyes will be ‘kaf fa ra.’” (Muslim, no. 5219) According to a report narrated by Hudhayfah, “This will be read by every believer, literate or illiterate.” (Muslim, no. 5223)
Is what is written between the eyes of the Dajjal real?
From the apparent meaning, this writing will be real, and the fact that some will see it whilst others will not, and that illiterate people will read it, is not problematic. “This is because Allah causes people to understand something when looking at it, as He wills and when He wills. So the believer will see this with his insight, even if he is illiterate, and the kafir will not be able to see it, even if he is literate. By the same token, the believer will see with his insight evidence that the kafir will not see. Allah will enable the believer to understand without him being literate, because at that time, extraordinary things will be happening.” (Fath al-Bari by Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqalani, 13/100)
Al-Nawawi said: “The correct view according to those who studied this issue is that this writing should be taken literally, as being real writing which Allah will create as a sign, one of the definitive proofs that (the Dajjal) is a kafir and a liar, to expose his falsehood. Allah will show this sign to every Muslim, literate or illiterate, and will conceal it from everyone whom He decrees is doomed or whom He wants to test. There is no reason why this  should be impossible.” (Sharh al-Nawawi li Sahih Muslim, 18/60) 
8- Another of his attributes was mentioned in the hadith of Fatimah bint Qays (may Allah be pleased with her), in the story of al-Jassasah, in which Tamim al-Dari (may Allah be pleased with him) said; “So we rushed to the monastery, where we saw the most enormous man we had ever seen, fettered with the most chains we had ever seen.” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 5235).
9- ‘Imran ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: ‘From the time of the creation of Adam until the Hour begins, there will never be a bigger creation than the Dajjal.’” (Narrated by Muslim, 5239). 
10- The Dajjal will not have any children, as stated in the hadith of Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him), who described what happened between him and Ibn Sayyad, who said to him: “Did you not hear the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say that he will have no children? …” Abu Sa’id said, ‘I said, ‘Yes…’” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 5209). 
From the reports quoted above, we may note that some of them describe his right eye as being blind or defective, and some describe his left eye as being blind or defective. Both accounts are sahih. Some of the scholars sought to reconcile these reports. Al-Qadi ‘Iyad said: “Both eyes of the Dajjal will be defective, because all the reports are sahih. His right eye will be the one that is abraded (mamsuh) and dull, unable to see, as stated in the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar. And his left eye will be the one that is covered with a thick fold of skin, and will also be defective.” So he will have a defect in both his right eye and his left eye; each of them will be blind, i.e., defective, because the Arabic word used in the hadith, a’war, is used to describe anything that is defective and is especially used to describe the eyes if they are impaired. One eye will be nonfunctional and the other will be defective.” 
Al-Nawawi agreed with this reconciliation suggested by al-Qadi ‘Iyad, and al-Qurtubi also approved of it. 
Where the Dajjal will emerge
The Dajjal will emerge from the direction of the east, from Khurasan, from among the Jews of Isfahan. Then he will travel throughout the earth and will leave no city without entering it, apart from Makkah and Madinah , which he will not be able to enter because the angels are guarding them. 
According to the hadith of Fatimah bint Qays (may Allah be pleased with her), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said concerning the Dajjal: 
“He will (emerge) from the direction of the Syrian sea or from the direction of the Yemeni sea… No, rather from the east…” – and he pointed towards the east. (Narrated by Muslim, no. 5228)
Abu Bakr al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us: “The Dajjal will emerge from a land in the east called Khurasan.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, no. 2163. Classed as sahih by al-Albani, Sahih al-Jami’ al-Saghir, hadith 3398). 
Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The Dajjal will emerge from among the Jews of Isfahan, and with him will be seventy thousand Jews, wearing crowns.’” (Narrated by Ahmad, no. 12865). 
Places which the Dajjal will never enter
It is forbidden for the Dajjal to enter Makkah or Madinah when he emerges at the end of time, because of the sahih ahadith narrated to that effect. As far as other places are concerned, he will enter them one after another. 
In the hadith of Fatimah bint Qays (may Allah be pleased with her), it says: “(He will say:), ‘I almost have permission to emerge. Then I will emerge and will travel throughout the earth for forty days, and I shall not leave any town without entering it, apart from Makkah and Madinah, which I will be prevented from entering because every time I try to enter,  there will be an angel with an unsheathed sword in his hand, preventing me from entering. On every gate there will be angels defending them.’” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 5228) 
It was also reported that the Dajjal will not enter the mosque of Sinai, or Masjid al-Aqsa (at Jerusalem). Imam Ahmad (no. 22572) narrated that Junadah ibn Umayyah al-Azdi said: “I came to a man from among the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said to him, ‘Tell me a hadith that you heard from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about the Dajjal.’ He mentioned the hadith, and said, ‘He will stay among you for forty days, during which he will go to every place (on the earth) apart from four mosques: Masjid al-Haram (in Makkah), the mosque of Madinah, the (mosque of) Sinai and Masjid al-Aqsa.’” 
The followers of the Dajjal
Most of the followers of the Dajjal will be from among the Jews, Persians and Turks, and a mixture of other people, mostly Bedouins and women. 
Imam Muslim narrated in his Sahih (5237) from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The followers of the Dajjal from among the Jews of Isfahan will number seventy thousand, wearing heavy, striped garments.” According to a report narrated by Imam Ahmad, “Seventy thousand Jews, wearing crowns.” (hadith no. 12865). 
According to the hadith of Abu Bakr referred to above: “He will be followed by people with faces like burnished shields.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, no. 2136). 
With regard to the Bedouin being followers of the Dajjal, this is because many of them are ignorant. With regard to women, this is because they are readily swayed, and because many of them are ignorant. It was reported that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Dajjal will come to this pond in Marriqanat – a valley in Madinah – and most of those who go out to him will be women, until a man will come to his mother in law, his mother, his daughter, his sister and his aunt, and will tie them up strongly for fear that they will go out to him.” (Narrated by Ahmad, no. 5099) 
The fitnah of the Dajjal 
The fitnah of the Dajjal will be the greatest fitnah from the time Allah created Adam until the Hour begins. This will be because of the mighty miracles that Allah will create with him, which will dazzle people’s minds and amaze them. 
It was reported that he will have a paradise and a hell with him, but his paradise will be his hell and his hell will be his paradise. He will have rivers of water and mountains of bread. He will command the sky to send down rain, and it will rain, and he will command the earth to bring forth vegetation and it will do so. The treasures of the earth will follow him, and he will travel rapidly, like clouds driven by the wind. And he will do other extraordinary feats. All of that was mentioned in the sahih ahadith. Imam Muslim narrated in his Sahih that Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The Dajjal will be one-eyed, blind in his left eye, and will have thick hair. He will have a paradise and a hell with him, but his paradise will be a hell and his hell will be a paradise.’” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 5222) 
Muslim also narrated that Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘I know what the Dajjal will bring with him: he will have two rivers flowing. One will clearly look like water and the other will clearly look like blazing fire. If any one of you sees that, let him choose the river which looks like fire, then let him close his eyes and lower his head and drink from it, for it will be cool water.’” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 5223) 
In the hadith of al-Nawwas ibn Sam’an about the Dajjal, it is reported that the Sahabah said: “O Messenger of Allah, how long will he stay on the earth?” He said, “Forty days: one day like a year, one day like a month, one day like a week, and the rest of the days like your days.” … They said, “How fast will he travel through the earth?” He said, “Like the clouds when they are driven by the wind. He will come to some people and call them, and they will believe in him and respond to him. Then he will command the sky to rain, and the earth to bring forth vegetation, and their cattle will come back to them in the evening, with their humps very high, and their udders full of milk, and their flanks stretched. Then he will come to another people and will call them, but they will reject him. So he will leave them and they will be stricken with famine, with none of their wealth in their hands. He will pass by ruins and will say, ‘Bring forth your treasure!’ – and the treasure will follow him like a swarm of bees. Then he will call a man who is brimming with youth, and will strike him with a sword and cut him in two, then (he will put the pieces apart from one another) the distance of an archer from his target. Then he will call him, and the young man will come forward smiling, with his face shining.” (narrated by Muslim, 5228) 
Al-Bukhari narrated from Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that this man whom the Dajjal will kill will be one of the best people, who will go out to the Dajjal from the city of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and will say to the Dajjal, “I bear witness that you are the Dajjal of whom the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us.” The Dajjal will say (to the people): “What do you think – if I kill this man then bring him back to life, will you have any doubts?” They will say, “No.” So he will kill him, then bring him back to life. Then he (the believing man) will say, “By Allah, I have never been more sure about you than I am today.” The Dajjal will want to kill him but will not be permitted to. (al-Bukhari, no. 6599) 
According to the hadith of Umamah al-Bahili (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said of the Dajjal: “Part of his fitnah will be that he will say to a Bedouin, Do you think that if I resurrect your father and mother for you that you will testify that I am your lord?’ He will say, ‘Yes.’ So two devils will appear to him in the image of his father and mother, saying, ‘O my son, follow him for he is your lord.’” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, no. 4067. Classed as sahih by al-Albani, Sahih al-Jami’ al-Saghir, hadith 7752) 
Protection against the fitnah of the Dajjal
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has taught his ummah about that which will protect them against the fitnah of the false messiah (al-Masih al-Dajjal). He left his ummah on a path that is clear, and no one deviates from it except the one who is doomed. He did not leave any good thing without pointing it out to his ummah, or any evil thing without warning them against it. Among the things which he warned us against  was the fitnah of the Dajjal, because it is the greatest fitnah which the ummah will face until the Hour comes. Every Prophet warned his ummah against the one-eyed Dajjal, but Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was the only Prophet who warned his ummah more about him. Allah told him many of the attributes of the Dajjal so that he could warn his ummah. The Dajjal will undoubtedly emerge among this ummah, because it is the last ummah, and Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the Seal of the Prophets. 
Prophetic guidelines on how to protect yourself from the fitnah of the Dajjal
There follow some of the Prophetic guidelines which the Chosen Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) set out for his ummah so that it may be protected against this mighty fitnah, from which we ask Allah to save us and grant us refuge: 

Adhering to Islam, having the right faith and learning the Names and Most Beautiful Attributes of Allah which are not shared by anyone else. One should know that the Dajjal will be a human being who will eat and drink, and that Allah is far above that; the Dajjal will be one-eyed but Allah is not one-eyed; no one can see his Lord until he dies, but the Dajjal will be seen by all people, believers and kafirs alike, when he emerges.
Seeking refuge with Allah from the fitnah of the Dajjal, especially in salah (prayer). This has been narrated in the sahih ahadith, such as that narrated from Umm al-Mu’minin ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray in his salah: “Allahumma inni a’udhu bika min ‘adhab al-qabri, wa a'udhu bika min fitnat il-masih il-dajjal, wa a’idhu bika min fitnat il-mahya wa fitnat il-mamat. Allahumma inni a’udhu bika min al-matham wa’l-maghram (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the torment of the grave, I seek refuge with You from the fitnah of the Dajjal, and I seek refuge with You from the trials of life and death. O Allah, I seek refuge with You from sin and debt).” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, no. 789)

Muslim narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘When any one of you says Tashahhud, let him seek refuge with Allah from four things, and say: “Allahumma inni a’udhi bika min ‘adhab jahannam wa min ‘adhab al-qabri wa min fitnat il-mahya wa’l-mamat wa min sharri fitnat al-masih al-dajjal (O Allaah, I seek refuge with You from the torment of Hell, from the torment of the grave, from the trials of life and death, and from the evil of the fitnah of the Dajjal).”’” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 924)

Memorizing ayat from Surat al-Kahf. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us to recite the opening verses of Surat al-Kahf against the Dajjal. According to some reports, the final verses of this surah were mentioned. This means reciting the first ten verses or the last ten. Among the ahadith narrated concerning this was the lengthy hadith narrated by Muslim from al-Nawwas ibn Sam’an, in which it says: “Whoever among you sees him (the Dajjal), let him recite against him the opening verses of Surat al-Kahf.”  (Hadith 5228).

Muslim (no. 1342) narrated from Abu’l-Darda that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever memorizes ten ayat from the beginning of Surat al-Kahf will be protected from the Dajjal” – i.e., from his fitnah. Muslim said: “Shu’bah said, ‘from the end of al-Kahf.’ Hammam said, ‘from the beginning of al-Kahf.’”
Al-Nawawi said: “The reason for this is because at the beginning of (this surah), mention is made of wonders and signs, and whoever ponders them will not be deceived by the fitnah of the Dajjal. And at the end of this surah, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Do then those who disbelieve think that they can take My slaves as awliya (lords etc.) besides Me?’ [al-Kahf 18:102].” (Sharh Sahih Muslim, 6/93).
This is one of the special features of Surat al-Kahf. There are ahadith which encourage reading it, especially on Fridays. Al-Hakim narrated from Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever recites Surat al-Kahf on Friday, it will be a light for him from one Friday to the next.” (al-Mustadrak, 2/368. Classed as sahih by al-Albani, Sahih al-Jami’ al-Saghir, hadith 6346)
Undoubtedly Surat al-Kahf is of great significance, containing great ayat, such as the story of the People of the Cave, the story of Musa and al-Khidr, the story of Dhu’l-Qarnayn and his building the dam to hold back Yajuj and Majuj, proof of the Resurrection and the blowing of the Trumpet, and explanation of those whose deeds are most lost, who are those who think that they are guided when in fact they are misguided and blind.
Every Muslim should strive to read this surah, and to memorize it and read it repeatedly, especially on the best day on which the sun rises, namely Friday.

Fleeing from the Dajjal and keeping far away from him. The best way is to live in Makkah or Madinah, and the places which the Dajjal will not enter. When the Dajjal emerges, Muslims should keep far away from him, because of the confusion he will cause and the mighty wonders that he will have with him, which Allah will cause to happen at his hands in order to test mankind. A man will come to him, thinking that he is a strong believer, then he will follow the Dajjal. We ask Allah to grant us and all the Muslims refuge from his fitnah.

Imam Ahmad (19118), Abu Dawud (3762) and al-Hakim (4/31) narrated from ‘Imran ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever hears of the Dajjal, let him keep far away from him, for a man will come to him and think that he is telling the truth because of the wonders that are sent with him.” 
Who will kill the Dajjal?
The Dajjal will die at the hands of the Messiah ‘Isa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him), as is indicated by the sahih ahadith. The Dajjal will appear on earth and will gain many followers, spreading his fitnah far and wide. No one will escape his fitnah except a few of the believers. At that point, ‘Isa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him) will descend to the eastern minaret in Damascus, and the believing slaves of Allah will gather around him. He will lead them towards the Dajjal, who at the time of the descent of ‘Isa (peace be upon him) will be heading for Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). ‘Isa will catch up with him at the gate of Ludd (Lod), a place in Palestine near Bayt al-Maqdis. When the Dajjal sees him, he will start to melt like salt melting in water, but ‘Isa (peace be upon him) will say to him, “I have some business with you, you will not get away from me.” Then he will catch up with him and will kill him with his spear. His followers will flee, pursued by the Muslims, who will kill them, and trees and rocks will say, ‘O Muslim, O slave of Allah, there is Jew behind me – come and kill him!” – apart from the gharqad (box thorn), for it is one of the trees of the Jews. 
Hadiths about the death of the Dajjal
There follow some of the ahadith narrated about the death of the Dajjal and his followers: 

Muslim (no. 5233) narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The Dajjal will emerge among my ummah and will stay for forty… Then Allah will send ‘Isa ibn Maryam, who looks like ‘Urwah ibn Mas’ud, and he will pursue him and kill him.” 
Imam Ahmad (no. 14920) and al-Tirmidhi (no. 2170) narrated that Majma’ ibn Jariyah al-Ansari (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: ‘The son of Maryam will kill the Dajjal at the gate of Ludd.” 
Muslim (no. 5228) narrated a lengthy hadith from al-Nawwas ibn Sam'an (may Allah be pleased with him) about the Dajjal, in which the story of the descent of Isa and his killing the Dajjal are mentioned. In this hadith the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “… Every kafir who will smell the fragrance of (‘Isa) will die, and his fragrance will reach as far as he will be able to see. He will then search for him (the Dajjal) until he catches up with him at the gate of Ludd, where he will kill him.” 
Imam Ahmad narrated that Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The Dajjal will emerge at a time when religious commitment is low and knowledge has decreased… Then ‘Isa ibn Maryam will descend just before dawn and will call people, saying, ‘O people, what is stopping you from coming out against this evil liar?’ They will say, ‘This man is a jinn’, then they will set out. When they reach ‘Isa ibn Maryam, the time for prayer will come, the iqamah will be given, and it will be said to him, ‘Go forward (to lead the prayer), O Spirit of Allah.’ He will say, ‘Let your imam go forward and lead you in prayer.’ When they have prayed Fajr, they will go out to meet him (the Dajjal) and when they see the liar, he will start to dissolve like salt in water. ‘Isa will go to him and kill him. Even the trees and rocks will call out, ‘O Spirit of Allah, here is a Jew!’ And none of those who followed him will be left, they will all be killed.” (Hadith no. 14426). 

When he (may Allah curse him) is killed, his great fitnah will come to an end. Allah will save those who believed from his evil and from the evil of his followers, at the hands of the Spirit and Word of Allah, ‘Isa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him) and his believing followers.

What is the correct view?",,,"Praise be to Allah.These ropes do not usually absorb the najaasah (impurity), and clothes are not usually put on them except after they have been washed, in which case they are pure (taahir), and they are usually wrung out after being washed, so their wetness is removed or reduced. Even if there is some najaasah present, it dries quickly, and with the sun and the wind the traces of najaasah will be removed and will no longer be noticeable.

8814,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8814,Killing old and sick animals,is it permissible to put an animal to sleep (euthanasia) if the animal is old and in pain?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh 
          Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen was asked this question and he said:  
          
If an animal gets sick, if it is an animal 
          whose meat it is not permissible to eat, and there is no hope that it 
          will recover, then there is no sin on you if you kill it, because if 
          it is kept alive it will become a burden on you which may be a waste 
          of your money, as you will have to spend on it and this spending will 
          be a waste of your money. Keeping it alive until it dies without giving 
          it food and drink is haraam, because the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A women went to Hell 
          because of a cat which she detained. She did not feed it when she detained 
          it, and she did not let it free to eat of the vermin of the earth.” 
          But if it is an animal whose meat may be eaten, and it reaches a state 
          where you cannot benefit from it or give it to someone else who can 
          benefit from it, then the ruling is the same as that concerning an animal 
          whose meat is haraam, i.e., it is permissible to kill it, whether you 
          slaughter it or kill it with bullets. Do whatever is easiest on the 
          animal, because the Prophet  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If you kill, kill well, 
          and if you slaughter, slaughter well. Let each one of you sharpen his 
          blade and let him spare suffering to the animal he slaughters.”","Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen From (Fataawa Manaar al-Islaam, 3/750)"

8818,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8818,Ruling on praying at times when prayer is not allowed,"One of my friend, who is very punctual in offering Namaz, has seen offering namaz sometimes even when the sun is setting. He is of the view that offering Namaz at sun set or sun rise time is not a sin and it might be just a makrooh. I told him that offering prayer at sun set or sun rise time is not allowed and it might be a sin also. Because to have distinction with non-muslims, it has not been allowed to offer namaz at this time.
Please tell me whether offering of prayers(Namaz) at sun set or sun rise time is makrooh or a sin and why?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is mustahabb to pray naafil prayers at all times, except at the times when praying is not allowed. These times are from after Fajr prayer until the sun has risen to the height of a spear; from noon time until after the sun has passed its zenith, which is at mid-day for about five minutes before the sun reaches its zenith; and from after ‘Asr prayer until the sun sets. What is meant is the prayer which each person does by himself; once he has prayed ‘Asr, it becomes haram for him to pray until the sun has set, except in specific cases, when it is not haram. See Question # 306 . 
The reason why it (prayer at these times) is not allowed is so as to avoid any resemblance to the kuffaar who prostrate to the sun when it rises as a greeting to it and to express their joy, and they prostrate to it when it sets as a farewell to it. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was keen to put a stop to all things that may lead to shirk, or that might involve any resemblance to the mushrikeen. With regard to the prohibition on praying when the sun is near its zenith, this is because this is the time when the Fire of Hell is intensified, as was reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so we should refrain from praying at these times.

    that you describe is exposing you to moral corruption and may be a means of causing you to commit sin. 
In many ahaadeeth, the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    warned men against the fitnah (temptation) of women, and he indicated that the matter is so serious that their fitnah is the worst of fitnahs and 
    the most harmful thing. 
It was narrated from Usaamah ibn Zayd (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I am not leaving behind me any fitnah more harmful to men than women.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4808; Muslim 2740 
It was narrated from ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Beware of entering upon women.” A man from among the Ansaar said, “O Messenger of Allaah, what about 
    the in-law?’ He said, “The in-law is death.” 
Al-Bukhaari, 4934; Muslim, 2172 
Ibn Hajar said, commenting on the first hadeeth: 
This hadeeth indicates that the fitnah caused by women is greater than any other 
    fitnah. This is supported by the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Beautified for men is the love of things they covet; women…”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:14]
Allaah described them as being among the things that men covet, and He mentioned 
    them first, before the other things, to indicate that they are the cause of the fitnah. We can see that a man is more inclined to love the 
    children of a woman to whom he is still married than the children of a woman whom he has divorced.  
Fath al-Baari, 9/138 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Undoubtedly allowing women to mix freely with men is the basis of all evils. This is one of the 
    greatest causes of punishment coming down upon everyone and of public and private affairs becoming corrupt. Free mixing of men and women is the 
    cause of much immorality and adultery, and it is the cause of general doom and diseases. 
… 
One of the greatest causes of general doom is the prevalence of adultery because of allowing 
    women to mix freely with men and to walk amongst them making a wanton display of their beauty. If the powers that be knew how much corruption it 
    causes to worldly interests and to people, they would prevent it most vigorously. 
Al-Turuq al-Hakamiyyah, p. 408 
In the mixing that you describe, it is not possible to lower one's gaze and it 
    provokes women to desire men and vice versa. This is not permissible; rather this is the thing that leads to corruption. If the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade that for his own cousin (son of his paternal uncle) al-Fadl ibn al-‘Abbaas, when 
    he was riding with him on his mount and they were performing one of the dearest acts of worship to Allaah, namely the Hajj, when Al-Fadl was in 
    the company of the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and at the time of the Sahaabah who were the most pious of people, 
    then how can we allow the women of our own times, when diseases of the heart are widespread and religious commitment is at such a low level, to 
    sit in the same place as men without a mahram, for so many hours every day?
 Fear Allaah, my sister, and do not go to this school, no matter how difficult 
    that may be. We will quote to you the hadeeth of al-Fadl referred to above: 
It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) 
    said: Al-Fadl was the riding partner of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). A woman from (the tribe of) 
    Kath’am came, and al-Fadl started looking at her and she started looking at him, so the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    turned al-Fadl’s face to the other side. She said, “O Messenger of Allaah, the command of Allaah enjoining Hajj upon His slaves has come when my 
    father is an old man and is not steady on his mount; can I do Hajj on his behalf?” He said, “Yes.” That was the Farewell pilgrimage. 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1442; Muslim, 1334. 
Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, commenting on this hadeeth: 
This hadeeth demonstrates the natural desire for women that is created in human 
    beings, and what may be feared from looking at them. Al-Fadl ibn ‘Abbaas was one of the young men of Banu Haashim, and he was the most handsome 
    man of his time, according to what they said. 
This also indicates that the ruler must prevent men and women from looking at one 
    another. That includes preventing the women for whom there is no guarantee that they will not cause or be subject to temptation from walking in 
    the streets and marketplaces and places where they can look at men. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:  “I am not 
    leaving behind me any fitnah more harmful to men than women.” And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), 
    and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts)…”
[al-Noor 24:31]
This is sufficient for the one who ponders the meanings of the Book of Allaah and is guided to 
    act upon it. 
Al-Tamheed, 9/123-124 
There is no need for mixing. Studying in this school is not essential; so long as a woman can 
    read and write and knows the teachings of her religion, that is sufficient, because she was created for that, i.e., to worship Allaah. Anything 
    beyond that is not essential.

There are saheeh ahadith which describe this torment for the people who commit these sins. For example: 
1 – Being struck with an iron hammer: 
It was narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When a person is placed in his grave and his companions leave him, and he can no longer hear the sound of their sandals (footsteps), two angels come to him and make him sit up, and they ask him, ‘What did you say about this man Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)?’ He says, ‘I bear witness that he is the slave of Allah and His Messenger.’ It is said, ‘Look at your place in Hell which Allah has replaced for you with a place in Paradise.’” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “And he sees them both. But as for the kaafir or hypocrite, he says, ‘I do not know, I used to say what the people said.’ It is said, ‘You did not know and you did not follow those who knew.’ Then he is struck a blow with an iron hammer between his ears and he screams a scream which everything around him can hear apart from the two races (of mankind and the jinn).” 
(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1222) 
2 –7: Furnishings from Hell are prepared out for him; he is clothed with fire; a door to Hell is opened for him; his grave is made narrow for him; he is struck with a great hammer which, if a mountain were to be struck with it, it would turn to dust; and he is given the tidings of torment in the Hereafter. Hence he will wish that the hour will never come.  
Ahmad (17803) and Abu Dawood (4753) narrated that al-Baraa’ ibn ‘Aazib said: We went out with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for the funeral of a man from among the Ansaar. We came to the grave and when (the deceased) was placed in the lahd, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sat down and we sat around him, as if there were birds on our heads (i.e., quiet and still). In his hand he had a stick with which he was scratching the ground. Then he raised his head and said, “Seek refuge with Allah from the torment of the grave”, two or three times …” – Then he mentioned the soul of the believer and how he is blessed in his grave. Then he said: “But when the disbelieving slave is about to depart this world and enter the Hereafter, there come down to him from heaven angels with black faces, bringing sackcloth, and they sit around him as far as the eye can see. Then the Angel of Death comes and sits by his head, and he says, ‘O evil soul, come forth to the wrath of Allah and His anger.’ Then his soul disperses inside his body, then comes out cutting the veins and nerves, like a skewer passing through wet wool. When he seizes it, they do not leave it in his hand for an instant before they take it and put it in that sackcloth, and there comes from it a stench like the foulest stench of a dead body on the face of the earth. Then they ascend and they do not pass by any group of angels but they say, ‘Who is this evil soul?’ and they say, ‘It is So and so the son of So and so, calling him by the worst names by which he was known in this world, until they reach the lowest heaven. They ask for it to be opened to them and it is not opened.” Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited (interpretation of the meaning): 
“for them the gates of heaven will not be opened, and they will not enter Paradise until the camel goes through the eye of the needle” [Al-A’raaf 7:40]
He said: “Then Allah says, ‘Record the book of My slave in Sijjeen in the lowest earth, and return him to the earth, for from it I created them, to it I will return them and from it I will bring them forth once again.’ So his soul is cast down.”  Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and whoever assigns partners to Allah, it is as if he had fallen from the sky, and the birds had snatched him, or the wind had thrown him to a far off place” [Al-Hajj 22:31]
He said: “Then his soul is returned to his body, and there come to him two angels who make him sit up and they say to him, ‘Who is your Lord?’ He says, ‘Oh, oh, I don’t know.’ They say, ‘What is your religion?’ He says, ‘Oh, oh, I don’t know.’ Then a voice calls out from heaven, ‘Prepare for him a bed from Hell and clothe him from Hell, and open for him a gate to Hell.’ Then there comes to him some of its heat and hot winds, and his grave is constricted and compresses him until his ribs interlock. Then there comes to him a man with an ugly face and ugly clothes, and a foul stench, who says, ‘Receive the bad news, this is the day that you were promised.’ He says, ‘Who are you? Your face is a face which forebodes evil.’ He says, ‘I am your evil deeds.’ He says, ‘O Lord, do not let the Hour come, do not let the Hour come.’”

8 – Being swallowed up by the earth. 
It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whilst a man was dragging his lower garment out of pride, the earth swallowed him up and he will continue sinking into the earth until the Day of Resurrection.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5345; Muslim, 3894). 
9- The edge of the mouth being torn to the back of the head
10- The head being smashed with a rock
11- Being burned in an tannoor oven
12- Swimming in a river of blood whilst being pelted with stones. 
Al-Bukhari (1386, 7047) narrated that Samurah ibn Jundub said: 
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) often used to ask his companions, “Has any one of you had a dream?” Then those whom Allah willed would tell him (about their dreams). One morning he said,
“Last night, two people came to me (in a dream), and woke me up and said, ‘Let’s go!’ I set out with them, and we came across a man who was lying down, with another man standing over him, holding a big rock. He threw the rock at the man's head, smashing it. The rock rolled away, and the one who had thrown it followed it, and picked it up. By the time he came back to the man, his head had been restored to its former state. Then he (the one who had thrown the rock) did the same as he had done before. I said to my two companions, ‘Subhaan Allah! Who are these two persons?’ They said, ‘Move on!’ So we went on, and came to a man who was lying flat on his back, with another man standing over him, holding an iron hook. He put the hook in the man's mouth and tore off that side of his face to the back (of his neck), and he tore his nose and his eye from front to back in a similar manner. Then he turned to the other side of the man's face and did likewise. No sooner had he finished the second side but the first side was restored to its former state, then he went back and did the same thing again. I said to my two companions, ‘Subhaan Allah! Who are these two persons?’ They said, ‘Move on!’ So we went on, and came to something like a tannoor (a kind of oven, lined with clay, usually used for baking bread).  – I think the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, in that oven there was much noise and voices. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) added:  - We  looked into it and saw naked men and  women. A flame of fire was reaching them from underneath, and when it reached them, they cried out loudly. I asked them, ‘Who are these?’ They said to me,  ‘Move on!’ So we went on and came to a river – I think he said, red like blood. – In the river there was a man swimming, and on the bank there was a man who had gathered many stones. Whilst the swimmer was swimming, the man who had gathered the stones approached him. The swimmer opened his mouth and the man on the bank threw a stone into it, then the swimmer carried on swimming. Each time he came back, he opened his mouth again, and the man on the bank threw another stone into his mouth. I said to my two companions, ‘Who are these two persons?’ They said, ‘Move on, move on!’ …
I said to them, I have seen many wonders this night. What do all these things mean that I have seen?’ They said: ‘We will tell you. The first man you came across, whose head was being smashed with the rock, is the man who studies the Quran then he neither recites it nor acts upon it, and he goes to sleep, neglecting the obligatory prayers. The man you came across whose mouth, nose and ears were being torn from front to back, is the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells a lie that is so serious that it spreads all over the world. The naked men and women whom you saw in a structure that resembled an oven are the adulterers and adulteresses. The man you saw swimming in the river with rocks being thrown into his mouth is the one who consumed riba (usury).”

12- Items stolen from the war booty will be set ablaze on the one who stole them.
 Al-Bukhari (4234) and Muslim (115) narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: “We went out with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to Khaybar, and Allah granted us victory. We did not take gold or silver as booty, but we seized goods, food and clothes, then we set out for the valley. Along with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) there was a slave called Rifaa’ah ibn Zayd. When we camped in the valley, the slave of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood up and began to unpack his saddlebag, when he was struck by a (stray) arrow which proved fatal. We said, ‘Congratulations to him, for he is a martyr, O Messenger of Allah.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:  ‘Not so, by the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, for the small garment that he stole from the booty on the day of Khaybar and which was not part of his share is burning like fire on him.’ The people were very distressed by this. Then a man brought one or two shoelaces and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, I found (them) on the day of Khaybar.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘A lace of fire’ or ‘Two laces of fire.’” 
13- Along with this physical punishment there will also be a spiritual or mental punishment, which is that in the grave the kaafir will be shown what would have been his place in Paradise if he had obeyed his Lord; this will increase his regret and pain when he realizes the greatness of the blessing that he has missed out on. 
Ahmad (10577) narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri said: I attended a funeral with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O people, this ummah will be tested in their graves. When a man is buried and his friends leave him, an angel with a hammer in his hand comes and sits by him and asks, ‘What do you say about this man?’ If he is a believer, he says, ‘I bear witness that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.’ He says, ‘You have spoken the truth.’ Then a door to Hell is opened for him and he says, ‘This would have been your place if you had disbelieved in your Lord, but because you believed, this is your place.’ Then a door to Paradise is opened for him and he wants to go there, but the angel says to him, ‘Calm down,’ and his grave is made wide and spacious for him. But if he is a kaafir or a hypocrite, (the angel) says to him, ‘What do you say about this man?’ He says, ‘I do not know, I heard the people saying something.’ The angel says, ‘You did not know and you did not follow those who knew and you were not guided.’ Then a door to Paradise is opened for him and he says, ‘This would have been your position if you had believed in your Lord. But because you disbelieved, Allah has replaced it for you with this.’ Then a gate to Hell is opened for him, and he strikes him a blow with the hammer which is heard by all of Allah’s creation apart from the two races (of mankind and the jinn).” Some of the people said, “O Messenger of Allah, there is no one who would have an angel standing by him holding a hammer but he would dumbfounded.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah will keep firm those who believe, with the word that stands firm.” [Ibraaheem 14:27 – interpretation of the meaning]

8844,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8844,The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the establishment of the Islamic society,How and with degree of success was muhammed(s.a.w)able to establish a stable community in medinah 632ce.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly the society that was established by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in Madeenah was an example of a stable and secure society. That was manifestly apparent from the moment the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) first set foot in Madeenah and stated to form the Islamic state. The security and stability of this society were due to a number of reasons and factors, including the following: 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) built the mosque in Madeenah as soon as he arrived there, which helped to establish a focal point to which people could turn when calamities struck, and a place where the Muslims could gather to meet one another and find out about one another, so they could find out who was sick and go to visit them, attend the funerals of those who died, help their poor and arrange marriages for those who were single.  
These are some of the ahadith concerning that: 
It was narrated from Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) that when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Madeenah, he ordered that the mosque should be built, and he said, “O Banu Najjaar, name me a price for this garden of yours.” They said, “No by Allah, we will not seek its price except from Allah.” 
(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2622; Muslim, 524) 
It was narrated that al-Bara’ ibn ‘Aazib said: “[The verse] ‘and do not aim at that which is bad to spend from it’ [al-Baqarah 2:267 – interpretation of the meaning] was revealed concerning us Ansaar. We used to own date palm trees. A man would bring (the harvest) from his date palms, whether it was a little or a lot. A man would bring one or two bunches of dates and hang them in the mosque. Ahl al-Suffah – or according to a report narrated by Ibn Maajah, the poor among the Muhaajireen – had no food, so if one of them got hungry he would come and strike the bunch with his stick, and ripe and unripe dates would fall, and he would eat them. But there were some uncharitable people who would bring a bunch of dates that contained rotten or dried-up dates, or a bunch that was damaged, and hang it up. Then Allah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Spend of the good things which you have (legally) earned, and of that which We have produced from the earth for you, and do not aim at that which is bad to spend from it, (though) you would not accept it save if you close your eyes and tolerate therein” [al-Baqarah 2:267]
He said: if any one of you were to be given something like they gave, he would not accept it unless he did so with his eyes closed or out of shyness. He said, after that one of us would bring the best dates that he had.
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2987; Ibn Maajah, 1822. Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2389. 
Secondly: 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) established brotherhood between the Muhaajireen (the Emigrants who had come from Makkah) and the Ansaar (helpers, the Muslims in Madeenah). This action strengthened the bonds between the members of the Madeenan society in a manner previously unheard of. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) established bonds of brotherhood between non-Arabs and Arabs, between free men and former slaves, between people of Quraysh and members of other tribes. So the society became one entity, after which it was not surprising that an Ansaari would ask a Muhaajir to take half of his wealth, or an Ansaari would offer to divorce one of his wives so that a Muhaajir could marry her, or a Muhaajir would inherit from an Ansaari, because of the strength of the bonds between them. Then inheritance between them was abrogated by the verse on inheritance, but the Ansaar were encouraged to bequeath something to them. This was an exemplary society.
There follow some of the ahadith concerning that: 
1 – It was narrated that ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Awf (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When we came to Madeenah, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) established bonds of brotherhood between me and Sa’d ibn al-Rabee’. Sa’d ibn al-Rabee’ said: “I am the wealthiest of the Ansaar, so I will give you half my wealth, and see which of my wives you would prefer, I will divorce her for you, and when she becomes permissible you can marry her.” ‘Abd al-Rahmaan said to him, “I do not need that. Is there a marketplace where people trade?” He said, “The marketplace of Qaynuqaa’.” So the next day ‘Abd al-Rahmaan went there and took some cottage cheese and ghee, and he did that the next day. It was not long before ‘And al-Rahmaan came with traces of yellow (perfume) on him. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Have you gotten married?” He said, “Yes?” He said, “To whom?” He said, “A woman from among the Ansaar.” He said, “How much was the mahr?” He said, “A gold piece equal in weight to a date stone (or a date stone of gold).” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him, “Give a wedding feast (waleemah), even if with one sheep.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1943. 
2 – It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) that when the Muhaajireen came to Madeenah, a Muhaajir would inherit from an Ansaari to the exclusion of the Ansaari’s own relatives, because of the bonds of brotherhood that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had established between them. When the verse “And to everyone, We have appointed heirs” [al-Nisa’ 4:33 – interpretation of the meaning] was revealed, that was abrogated. And the phrase “To those also with whom you have made a pledge (brotherhood)” [al-Nisa’ 4:33 – interpretation of the meaning] has to do with the covenant of helping, supporting and advising one another. So the rights of inheritance no longer apply, but they may bequeath to one another. 
Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2170. 
Thirdly: 
Zakaah was prescribed in the second year of the Hijrah, which made the rich and poor more equal and increased the coherence of the Madeenan society, and the bonds of brotherhood for the sake of Allah became stronger than before. Indeed, the matter went further than zakaah to include voluntary charity. 
It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Abu Talhah was the wealthiest of the Ansaar of Madeenah in terms of palm trees, and the dearest of his wealth to him was (the garden of) Bayraha’, which was opposite the mosque. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to enter it and drink from good water that was to be found there. Anas said: When the verse “By no means shall you attain Al-Birr (piety, righteousness — here it means Allah’s reward, i.e. Paradise), unless you spend (in Allah’s Cause) of that which you love” [Aal- Imraan 3:92 – interpretation of the meaning] was revealed, Abu Talhah got up and went to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of Allah, Allah says ‘By no means shall you attain Al-Birr (piety, righteousness — here it means Allah’s reward, i.e. Paradise), unless you spend (in Allah’s Cause) of that which you love’ and the dearest of my wealth to me is Bayraha’. (I give it in) charity for the sake of Allah, hoping to earn its reward with Allah, so dispose of it, O Messenger of Allah, as Allah shows you.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Well done, that is a profitable deal, that is a profitable deal. I have heard what you said and I think that you should distribute it among your relatives.” Abu Talhah said, “I shall do that, O Messenger of Allah,” and he distributed it among his relatives and the sons of his paternal uncles. 
Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1392; Muslim, 998 
So the signs of harmony appeared among the Muslims in Madeenah, and the Muhaajireen recognized the rights that their Ansaar brothers had over them. There are a number of ahadith concerning that, including the following:
 It was narrated that Anas said: When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Madeenah, the Muhaajireen came to him and said, “O Messenger of Allah, we have never seen any people more generous when they have the means and more helpful when they have little than the people among whom we have settled. They have looked after us and they have let us join them and share in all their happy occasions, to such an extent that we are afraid that they will take all the reward. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Not so long as you pray for them and praise them.” 
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2487; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2020.
Allah created loved between the hearts of the people of Madeenah, and love for the sake of Allah was one of the symbols of the people that Allah enjoined upon them and made it one of the signs of perfect faith.
It was narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhari, 13; Muslim, 45. 
It was narrated that al-Nu’maan ibn Basheer said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The believers, in their mutual mercy, love and compassion, are like a (single) body; if one part of it feels pain, the rest of the body will join it in staying awake and suffering fever.”

After his death his brother & other relatives took his dead body to their village which was at about 14 hours drive from the place where he used to live.His wife told his brothers that her husband has left a written statement(wasiyah) that he should be burried immediately at the same place where he will die. No one listened to her & later his written statement with his signatures was found in his papers. Has his brother & other relatives committed a sin? What should be done now? Is their any Sadaqat which has to be paid by the relatives on not following the Wasiyah (written statement) or what?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.This issue may be discussed from two angles: 
1 – The issue of acting upon the wishes of the deceased
2 – The ruling on moving the deceased from the land in which he died to another land. 
With regard to the first issue, it is obligatory to carry out the wishes of the deceased, whether he left a will describing something obligatory or something mustahabb. 
See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 5/333 
With regard to the second issue: 
Shaykh Ibn Qudaamah said: 
The deceased should not be moved from his land to another land unless that is for a valid reason. This is the view of al-Awzaa’i and Ibn al-Mundhir…and because it is easier and it avoids any delay that may cause the corpse to start decaying before burial. But if there is a valid reason for doing so, then it is permissible. 
Al-Mughni, 2/193-194 
The Standing Committee said concerning this issue: 
The Sunnah at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the time of the Sahaabah was to bury the deceased in the graveyard of the land or city in which he died, and to bury the martyrs where they died. It is not proven in any hadeeth or report that any of the Sahaabah was moved to a place other than the graveyard of the land or city in which he died, or to another place nearby. 
Because of that, the majority of fuqaha’ said: it is not permissible to move the deceased before burial to a land other than the one in which he died, unless that is for a valid reason such as the fear that his grave may be violated if he is buried where he died, or that it may be mistreated, in which case he must be moved to a place where his grave will be safe. 
For example, moving him to his homeland so that his family will feel better and will be able to visit his grave is permissible. 
But in such cases that is subject to the condition that there is no fear that the corpse may start to decay because of the delay in burial, and that his sanctity will not be violated. If there is no need to move him and these conditions are not met, then it is not permissible to move him. 
The Committee believes that every deceased person should be buried in the graveyard of the city in which he dies, and that they should not be moved to another city unless that is for a valid reason, in accordance with the Sunnah and the practice of the salaf or early generations of this ummah, so as to avoid transgressing the rules of sharee’ah, to bury the deceased quickly as encouraged in sharee’ah, to protect the deceased from the procedures that may be done to his body to prevent decay, and to avoid the extravagance of spending large amounts of money unnecessarily and for which there is no legitimate shar’i need, as well as protecting the rights of the heirs and saving this money so that it may be spent in the proper ways.  
This is the fatwa signed by the Committee. May Allah send blessings upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and companions. 
Fatawa Islamiyyah, 2/31, 32 
With regard to what the relatives of the deceased have done: 
If they went against the will and did not act in accordance with the wishes of the deceased after his wife told them because they were did not believe that she was telling the truth, then there is no sin on them, because they did not go against his wishes deliberately. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And there is no sin on you concerning that in which you made a mistake, except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend”
[al-Ahzaab 33:5]
However, if they believed her but they did not care and they went against the will, then they are sinners who have transgressed against the rights of the deceased. 
With regard to their moving the deceased this distance, if there was no valid reason for doing so then this is a second transgression against the rights of the deceased, because part of honouring the deceased is to prepare him and bury him quickly, as the scholars have said. 
See al-Madkhil, 3/237, by Abu’l-Haaj al-Maaliki. 
So they have to repent and seek forgiveness, and regret what they have done, and make du’aa’ for the deceased, but they do not have to give anything in charity, but if they do so then that will be good, for charity is one of the means of forgiveness and expiation of sins.

8857,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8857,Fasting more than three days in the month,"I have read hadith on how one should not fast more than 3 times in a month, or to fast like Dawud. I recently read stories of how the sahaba fasted many days in compensation for their misdeeds. Is this permissible?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.What you have read, that it is not permissible to fast for more than three days in a month or to observe the fast of Dawood (peace be upon him), is not correct. The matter is more flexible than that. You can fast less than three days or more. There follow some of the ahaadeeth on this topic: 
1 – It was narrated from Abu Qutaadah al-Ansaari (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about his fasting. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) got angry, then ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said, “We are content with Allah as our Lord, with Islam as our religion, with Muhammad as our Prophet and with the oath of allegiance (bay’ah) that we have given.” Then he was asked about one who fasts for a lifetime and he said, “He did not fast and he did not break his fast.” [I.e., it becomes a routine for him such that he no longer feels the difference between fasting and not fasting] Then he was asked about fasting two days and not fasting for one day, and he said, “Who is able to do that?” Then he was asked about fasting one day and not fasting for two days, and he said, “Would that Allah gave us strength for that.” And he was asked about fasting one day and not fasting one day (i.e., fasting alternate days) and he said, “That is the fasting of my brother Dawood (peace be upon him).” And he was asked about fasting on Mondays, and he said, “That is the day on which I was born and the day on which my mission began (or on which Revelation came down to me).” And he said, “Fasting for three days each month and Ramadaan each year is the fast of a lifetime.” And he was asked about fasting on the Day of ‘Arafaah, and he said, “It expiates for the past year and the coming year,” and he was asked about fasting on the Day of ‘Ashoora’, and he said, “It expiates for the past year.” Narrated by Muslim, 1162. 
It is clear from this hadeeth that fasting is encouraged, whether it is one or two days each year, one day each week, three days each month, fasting one day and not fasting two days or vice versa, or fasting one day and not the next. The matter is flexible. 
2 – It was narrated from Abu Ayyoob al-Ansaari (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever fasts Ramadaan then follows it with six days of Shawwaal, it is as if he fasted for a lifetime.” Narrated by Muslim, 1164. 
This indicates that what the questioner has read is wrong, for it encourages fasting six days in one month. 
3 – It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fast until we thought that he would never break his fast, then he would not fast until we thought that he would never fast. I never saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fasting a complete month apart from Ramadaan, and I never saw him fast in any other month more than Sha’baan.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1868; Muslim, 1156). 
This hadeeth also clearly indicates that there is no set limit or any specific number of days to be fasted.

8858,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8858,Parents Watching Over Their Children,"As a Muslim parent trying to raise my children Islamically, what is your advice on searching my children’s belongings, and if I find things that are haram (impermissible) or forbidden do I have the right to take them and destroy them even though they are in their possession?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Our advice is that the mother or father should from time to time examine their children’s belongings. That is because the Shaytaan may make attractive to them the idea of keeping something haraam that it is not permissible to look at or listen to. This is part of the responsibility that Allah has enjoined upon parents towards their children. 
For many sons and daughters, the means of their being guided and their giving up evil things that they are indulging in is the watchfulness of their fathers and mothers, and their taking good care of them. It is easy to put a stop to evil at the beginning, or to warn against bad friends at the beginning, but if it has been going on for a long time, it will be difficult to rescue sons and daughters from this bad company. 
In most cases, it will be possible to find out what bad things your sons and daughters have by inspecting their bags, reading their books and getting to know their friends. 
How many young men and women have wished that their parents had watched what they were doing and examined their belongings at an early stage, before corruption took a hold of their hearts. 
Hence we advise you to do this from time to time, without letting them realize that, lest they take precautions and avoid keeping anything dubious with their stuff. 
This watching should be done if the parent sees some indication that his child is starting to go astray. But if it seems that the child is righteous and keeping away from evil things, then neither the parents or anyone else has the right to watch over the child or inspect his personal belongings, because that comes under the heading of suspicion and spying, which Allah has forbidden when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Avoid much suspicion; indeed some suspicions are sins. And spy not”
[al-Hujuraat 49:12]
But if the mother or father finds something haraam, then they have to destroy it, and then advise the child in whose possession this evil thing was found.
It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand (by taking action); if he cannot, then with his tongue (by speaking out); and if he cannot, then with his heart (by hating it and feeling that it is wrong), and that is the weakest of faith.” 
(Narrated by Muslim, 49). 
Imam al-Nawawi said: 
With regard to the Prophet’s words “let him change it”, this is a positive command, according to the consensus of the ummah(Muslim community). The Qur’aan, Sunnah and consensus of the ummah all agree that it is obligatory to enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil; this is also part of the sincerity (naseehah) which is the religion. 
Moreover, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil is fard kafaayah (a communal obligation). If some of the people undertake to do it, the rest are absolved of blame; but if they all fail to do it, then everyone who was able to do it but did not, with no excuse and no fear, is guilty of sin. 
But it may become fard ‘ayn (an individual obligation), for example if it is in a place which no one knows but him, or no one can remove it but him, or if he sees his wife, his son or his slave doing something evil, or falling short in doing something good.   
Al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This hadeeth (prophetic narration) sets out the principle of changing evil. The one who seeks to change it can do so by whatever means possible, and remove it by word or deeds. So he may break the instruments of falsehood and spill (alcohol) himself or order that this be done, and he can take items seized by force and return them to their owners himself, or he can issue orders that this be done, but he should be gentle with the ignorant, and also with those in positions of power and status, if there is any fear of their evil, because they are more likely to respond to gentleness than harshness.

“The eye commits zinaa (fornication, adultery), and its zinaa is looking.”
(narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Isti’dhaan, 5774). So you have to repent sincerely from this action, and that includes several things: 
Giving up this sin, out of fear of the punishment of Allaah.
Deeply regretting what you have done of this haraam thing.
Sincerely resolving not to return to this sin ever again.  
You should know that there are many ways of purifying the soul from these haraam things, such as:
Adhering firmly to repentance, saying a lot of du’aa’, frequently seeking Allaah’s forgiveness and repenting, persisting in dhikr, doing lots of acts of worship and good deeds, and praying a lot. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, As Salaah (the prayer) prevents from Al‑Fahshaa’ (i.e. great sins of every kind, unlawful sexual intercourse) and Al Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism, and every kind of evil wicked deed)” [al-‘Ankaboot 29:45] 
“And perform As Salaah (Iqaamat as Salaah), at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night [i.e. the five compulsory Salaah (prayers)]. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds (i.e. small sins)” [Hood 11:114] 
You have to look for a good environment to live in, and for righteous friends who will help you to do good, so that you may keep away from these things. All of these actions will purify and cleanse your soul, and help you to please Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Indeed, he succeeds who purifies his own self [his soul]…”[al-Shams 91:9] 
You should know that when a person is sincere in his repentance and prays to Allaah, and asks Him to keep him safe from the evil of his own self and from the Shaytaan, Allaah will protect him from the waswaas (insinuating whispers) and plots of the Shaytaan. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty) [al-Talaaq 65:2]

If women need to pray in the marketplace and there is a place that is screened off, there is nothing wrong with them praying there. A woman’s prayer is not invalidated just because a man happens to see her.","Is it better for a woman to pray at home?


Can women pray in public places?","Praise be to Allah.Is it better for a woman to pray at home?
ِA woman should be protected and concealed from men as much as her guardian can do that. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) preferred for women to pray in their houses and said that their reward for doing so is greater than their reward for praying in the mosque . 
It was narrated from `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A woman's prayer in her room is better than her prayer in her courtyard, and her prayer in her cabinet is better than her prayer in her room.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 570; At-Tirmidhi, 1173. This Hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Targhib wat Tarhib, 1/136). 
“Her room” refers to a woman`s own room in the house, and “her courtyard” refers to the central area (in a traditional Arabic house), off which all the rooms of the house open. 
A cabinet is like a small room inside the large room, in which personal items are stored. (Commentary from `Awn Al-Ma`bud). 
It was narrated that Umm Humayd (may Allah be pleased with her) the wife of Abu Humayd As-Sa`idi (may Allah be pleased with him) came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of Allah, I like to pray with you.” He said, “I know that you like to pray with me, but your prayer in your room is better for you than your prayer in your courtyard and your prayer in your courtyard is better for you than your praying in your house, and your prayer in your house is better for you than your prayer in the mosque of your people, and your prayer in the mosque of your people is better for you than your prayer in my mosque.” So she issued orders that a prayer-place be prepared for her in the furthest and darkest part of her house, and she used to pray there until she met Allah (i.e., died).” (Narrated by Ahmad, 26550)
This Hadith was classed as authentic by Ibn Khuzaymah in his Sahih, 3/95; Ibn Majah, 5/595; Al-Albani in Sahih At-Targhib wat Tarhib, 1/135 
It was narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “If the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had lived to see how women have started to behave, he would have prevented them [from going to the mosque] as the women of the Children of Israel were prevented.” I said, to `Umrah, “Were they prevented?” He said, “Yes.”  (Al-Bukhari, 831; Muslim, 445) 
`Abd Al-`Adhim Abadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The reason why their praying in their homes is better is because it is safer from temptation. This was later borne out by the way in which women began to make a wanton display of their adornments, hence `A`ishah said what she said.” (`Awn Al-Ma`bud, 2/193) 
Can women pray in public places?
Hence women should be careful when praying in public places, or go far away from where men can see them , and should not pray in a public place when the time of prayer comes, unless she has no other place in which to pray.  
Shaykh `Abullah Al-Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“With regard to women, their houses are better for them. If they need to pray in the marketplace and there is a place that is screened off , there is nothing wrong with them praying there, in sha Allah.” (Fatawa Al-Mar`ah Al-Muslimah, 1/333) 
But what some of the common people say, that a woman`s prayer is invalidated just because a man happens to see her, has no basis in Shari`ah at all. Women used to pray at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in one mosque and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not rule their prayer to be invalid.

      entitled to take zakaah. This was the view stated by the Shaafa’is and

8889,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8889,Is Insurance Haram?,What are the rulings on commercial insurance which is widespread nowadays?,"Commercial insurance is haram in Islam because it is a form of riba and it is based on gambling and uncertainty. It also consumes people’s wealth unjustly. Co-operative insurance is also haram in Islam. For more, see the detailed answer.","Commercial insurance is a form of riba


Commercial insurance is based on gambling


Insurance is based on uncertainty 


Commercial insurance consumes people’s wealth unjustly


Is cooperative insurance halal?","Praise be to Allah.Commercial insurance is a form of riba
All kinds of commercial insurance are clearly and undoubtedly riba (interest/usury). Insurance is the sale of money for money, of a greater or lesser amount, with a delay in one of the payments. It involves riba al-fadl (interest-based transaction) and riba al-nasiah (interest to be charged if payment is delayed beyond the due date), because the insurance companies take people’s money and promise to pay them more or less money when a specific accident against which insurance has been taken out happens. This is riba, and riba is forbidden in the Quran, in many ayat.
Commercial insurance is based on gambling
All kinds of commercial insurance are based on nothing but gambling which is haram according to the Quran:
“O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al-Ansab (stone altars for sacrifice to idols etc.) and Al-Azlam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytan’s handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.” (al-Maidah 5:90 – interpretation of the meaning).
All kinds of insurance are kinds of playing with chances. They tell you, pay this much money, then if this happens to you we will give you this much. This is pure gambling. Insisting on differentiating between insurance and gambling is pure stubbornness that is unacceptable to any sound mind. The insurance companies themselves admit that insurance is gambling.
Insurance is based on uncertainty 
All kinds of insurance are forms of uncertainty, and transactions which involve uncertainty are forbidden according to many sahih ahadith, such as the hadith narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him):
“The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade transactions determined by throwing a stone and transactions which involved some uncertainty.” (Narrated by Muslim).
[“Transactions determined by throwing a stone” – this was a type of transaction that was prevalent in the markets of pre-Islamic Arabia, whereby a stone was thrown by either the buyer or the seller, and whatever it touched, its transaction became binding. “Transactions which involve some uncertainty” – is a transaction in which there is no guarantee that the seller can deliver the goods for which he receives payment. Footnotes from the translation of Sahih Muslim. (Translator’s Note)]
All forms of commercial insurance are based on uncertainty of the most extreme kind. Insurance companies and those who sell insurance refuse to insure cases except where there is clear uncertainty in whether or not the condition being insured against will happen or not. 
In other words, the condition being insured against must have a possibility of happening or not happening (as opposed to, for example, someone who has a pre-existing condition, such as a person who is on death row applying for life insurance--translator.) 
Moreover, this transaction involves something uncertain, which is when an accident will happen and the extent of the damage caused. Hence insurance combines three kinds of extreme uncertainty.
Commercial insurance consumes people’s wealth unjustly
All kinds of commercial insurance consume people’s wealth unjustly, which is haram according to the Quran:
“O you who believe! Eat not up your property among yourselves unjustly” (al-Nisa 4:29 – interpretation of the meaning).
All forms of commercial insurance are fraudulent transactions aimed at consuming people’s wealth unjustly. The precise statistics calculated by one of the German experts state that what people get back from what has been taken from them is no more than 2.9%.
Insurance is an immense loss for the nation, and there is no evidence or excuse to be found in the actions of the kuffar who have lost the ties of kinship and friendship and are therefore forced to resort to insurance, which they hate as much as they hate death.
These are only some of the violations of shari’ah which insurance is essentially based upon. There are numerous other violations which we do not have room to mention here, and there is no need to do so, because just one of the violations which we have mentioned above is sufficient to make insurance one of the things which is most prohibited in the Shari’ah of Allah. 
It is a shame that some people are deceived by the ways in which the insurance companies make insurance attractive and confuse them by calling it “cooperative” or “mutual support ”or “Islamic”, or other names which do not change the unjust nature of insurance in the slightest. 
Is cooperative insurance halal?
The insurance companies’ claim that the ‘ulama have issued fatwas stating that so-called “cooperative insurance'' is halaal, is a lie. The reason for this confusion is that some insurance companies approached the ‘ulama with a deceitful set-up which has nothing to do with any kind of insurance, but they said that it was a kind of insurance which they called “cooperative insurance ” (to make it sound attractive and to confuse the people). 
They said that it was purely in the nature of a donation, and that it was a kind of the cooperation enjoined by Allah in the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): “Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety)…” (al-Maidah 5:2), and that the aim was to cooperate in alleviating the overwhelming disasters that may befall people.
But in fact what they called cooperative insurance was just like any other kind of insurance; the only difference was in the way in which it was set up, not in its essential nature. It was far from being any kind of simple donation or cooperation in righteousness and piety; in fact it is a kind of cooperation in sin and transgression. It was not aimed at helping to relieve the distress of calamities, but at depriving people of their wealth by unjust means, which is absolutely haram, as are other kinds of insurance. Hence what they proposed to the ‘ulama is not even insurance at all.
With regard to the claim made by some, that part of the premium (money paid to the insurer) is returned, this does not change anything and does not free insurance from the taint of riba, gambling, transactions based on uncertainty, unjust consumption of people’s wealth and going against the principle of trusting in Allah (tawakkul), and other kinds of haram actions. 
Insurance is deceit and confusion. Anyone who wishes to learn more should refer to the essay al-Tamin wa Ahkamuhu (Insurance and its rulings). I call on every Muslim who has pride in his religion and whose hopes are focused on Allah and the Last Day to fear Allah and to avoid all kinds of insurance, no matter how attractive their proponents make them, for they are undoubtedly forbidden. In this manner he will protect his religion and his wealth, and he will be blessed with security from the Owner of security, may He be exalted.
May Allah help me and you to have insight into matters of religion and to do that which is pleasing to the Lord of the Worlds.

The normal rule I know is to forgive the ignorant when they do these things, but I read in Usoolus Sunnah (a book in english) that Imam Ahmad said ""I forgive everyone except a mubtadi'"" - so if he does not forgive a mubtadi' then why should we forgive kufaar?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Islam urges us to be tolerant and forgive others. This is indicated in both the Qur’aan and the Sunnah. Indeed, one of the features of Islam is that it is deen al-rahmah (the religion of mercy). By the same token the Muslim should be easy going, not one who puts others off; he should forgive when he is able to take revenge and be tolerant when people make mistakes.  
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Many of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) wish that if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed, out of envy from their ownselves, even after the truth (that Muhammad is Allaah’s Messenger) has become manifest unto them. But forgive and overlook, till Allaah brings His Command. Verily, Allaah is Able to do all things”
[al-Baqarah 2:109] 
“So, because of their breach of their covenant, We cursed them and made their hearts grow hard. They change the words from their (right) places and have abandoned a good part of the Message that was sent to them. And you will not cease to discover deceit in them, except a few of them. But forgive them and overlook (their misdeeds). Verily, Allaah loves Al‑Muhsinoon (good‑doers”
[al-Maa’idah 5:13] 
“O you who believe! Verily, among your wives and your children there are enemies for you (who may stop you from the obedience of Allaah); therefore beware of them! But if you pardon (them) and overlook, and forgive (their faults), then verily, Allaah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Taghaabun 64:14]
So this forgiveness of the kaafirs should be for the sake of seeking reward with Allaah and softening the hearts of the kaafirs to the idea of entering the religion of Allaah. This is a kind of gentleness and tolerance that is encouraged and is aimed at achieving great things, namely reward from Allaah and encouraging the kaafirs to enter the religion of Islam. For the attitude of the Muslims conquered the hearts of many of the mushrikeen before the Muslims’ swords and cavalry conquered their strongholds, and they entered the religion of Allaah in crowds, seeking whatever it was in this religion that created such a good attitude in its people. 
Allaah says concerning this (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And by the Mercy of Allaah, you dealt with them gently. And had you been severe and harsh‑hearted, they would have broken away from about you; so pass over (their faults), and ask (Allaah’s) forgiveness for them; and consult them in the affairs. Then when you have taken a decision, put your trust in Allaah, certainly, Allaah loves those who put their trust (in Him)”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:159]
The mercy, kindness and gentleness of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was the reason why people entered the religion of Allaah. If the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had not been so kind and gentle, he would have put off the people around him, and they would have left him and not believed in his message. 
It was narrated from ‘Urwah ibn al-Zubayr that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: A group of Jews entered upon the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, “Al-saam ‘alaykum.” (al-saam means death). ‘Aa’ishah said: “I understood them, and said, ‘Wa ‘alaykum al-saam wa’l-la’nah (and upon you be death and curses).’ But the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ‘Wait, O ‘Aa’ishah, for Allaah loves kindness in all things.’ I said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, did you not hear what they said?’ The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘I said, “Wa ‘alaykum (and also unto you).”’” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5678; Muslim, 2164 
Ibn Hajar said, commenting on this hadeeth: 
Because the Jews at that time were people with whom the Muslims had a treaty, so it seems that this was for the purpose of maintaining harmony with them. 
Fath al-Baari, 11/43 
Secondly: 
Allaah has given the Muslim permission, if aggression is committed against him, to settle the score, but He encourages him to forgive. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The recompense for an evil is an evil like thereof; but whoever forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is with Allaah. Verily, He likes not the Zaalimoon (oppressors, polytheists, and wrongdoers).
And indeed whosoever takes revenge after he has suffered wrong, for such there is no way (of blame) against them.
The way (of blame) is only against those who oppress men and rebel in the earth without justification; for such there will be a painful torment.
And verily, whosoever shows patience and forgives, that would truly be from the things recommended by Allaah”
[al-Shoora 42:40-43]
“Allaah does not like that the evil should be uttered in public except by him who has been wronged. And Allaah is Ever All‑Hearer, All‑Knower”
[al-Nisa’ 4:148]
But we should note that the Muslim should forgive any wrong done to him by a kaafir in such a way that does not cause him humiliation, because the Muslim should be proud. Allaah has honoured him and he should feel proud of that and take that as his attitude, because if he is proud then Islam and all the Muslims are honoured. But if this forgiveness will lead to humiliation, then the Muslim has to settle the score. Concerning that Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who, when an oppressive wrong is done to them, take revenge”
[al-Shoora 42:39]
Imam Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali said, commenting on this verse: 
With regard to the phrase “And those who, when an oppressive wrong is done to them, take revenge” – this does not contradict the idea of forgiveness, because taking revenge may mean demonstrating the ability to take revenge, then one may forgive after that, in which case forgiveness will come in a better context. Al-Nakha’i said concerning this verse: They do not like to be humiliated, so if they are in a position to settle the score, then they will forgive. Mujaahid said: They did not like for the believer to let himself be humiliated, which would lead the evildoers to feel contempt for him. 
If the believer is wronged, then he should show that he is able to take revenge, then he should forgive after that. Many of the salaf did that, including ‘Ata’, Qataadah and others. 
Jaami’ al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hukam, 1/179 
Hence forgiveness is not good in all cases, rather it may be blameworthy if it results in humiliation of the Muslim or encourages the aggressor even further, etc. 
Allaah has referred to that in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “but whoever forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is with Allaah” [al-Shoora 42:40]. Here Allaah states that forgiveness is only good if it is done for the sake of reconciliation; if it leads to bad consequences then it is not good.
Hence the Muslim should look at which serves the greater interest – forgiveness or seeking revenge – and act accordingly. This will vary according to circumstances and the people involved. What Imam Ahmad said about forgiving everyone who causes harm except for an innovator (mubtadi’) is in accordance with this, because he thought that forgiving the followers of bid’ah would have bad consequences, which is that the people would be encouraged to follow innovation. So he stated clearly that innovators were not to be forgiven, as a way of putting people off from those innovations. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Whoever from among you turns back from his religion (Islam), Allaah will bring a people whom He will love and they will love Him; humble towards the believers, stern towards the disbelievers, fighting in the way of Allaah, and never fear of the blame of the blamers. That is the Grace of Allaah which He bestows on whom He wills. And Allaah is All‑Sufficient for His creatures’ needs, All‑Knower”
[al-Maa'idah 5:54]
“Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. And those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and falling down prostrate (in prayer), seeking Bounty from Allaah and (His) Good Pleasure. The mark of them (i.e. of their Faith) is on their faces (foreheads) from the traces of prostration (during prayers). This is their description in the Tawraat (Torah). But their description in the Injeel (Gospel) is like a (sown) seed which sends forth its shoot, then makes it strong, and becomes thick and it stands straight on its stem, delighting the sowers, that He may enrage the disbelievers with them. Allaah has promised those among them who believe (i.e. all those who follow Islamic Monotheism, the religion of Prophet Muhammad till the Day of Resurrection) and do righteous good deeds, forgiveness and a mighty reward (i.e. Paradise)”
[al-Fath 48:29]
So the Muslim has the right to forgive with regard to things that have to do with him, i.e., his personal rights, but he does not have the right to remain silent when the sacred limits of Allaah are transgressed. 
It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was never given the choice between two things but he chose the easier of them, so long as it was not a sin. But if it was a sin he would be the furthest of the people from it. And the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) never took revenge for himself, unless the sacred limits of Allaah were transgressed, then he would take revenge for the sake of Allaah.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3367; Muslim, 2327 
Thirdly: 
It is permissible for a Muslim to refrain from taking revenge on a kaafir if the Muslim is in a weak position and is not strong. If he is weak then it is permissible for him not to fight. Allaah forbade the Muslims to fight at the beginning of Islam when they were weak and oppressed. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Truly, Allaah defends those who believe. Verily, Allaah likes not any treacherous ingrate to Allaah [those who disobey Allaah but obey Shaytaan (Satan)]”
[al-Hajj 22:38]
Imam al-Qurtubi said, commenting on this verse: 
It was narrated that this was revealed because of the believers whose numbers had increased in Makkah and they were being persecuted by the kuffaar. After some of them had migrated to Abyssinia, some of the believers in Makkah wanted to fight whomever they could of the kuffaar and to assassinate them, betray them and trick them. So this verse was revealed, in which Allaah promised to defend the believers, and He expressly forbade treachery and betrayal. 
Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 12/67 
But when the Muslims grew stronger after having been weak, Allaah gave the believers permission to fight, as He said: 
“Permission to fight (against disbelievers) is given to those (believers) who are fought against, because they have been wronged; and surely, Allaah is Able to give them (believers) victory”
[al-Hajj 22:39]
Imam al-Qurtubi said, commenting on this verse: 
With regard to the phrase “Permission to fight (against disbelievers) is given to those (believers) who are fought against”. It was said that this is the explanation of the words “Truly, Allaah defends those who believe”, i.e., He wards off the plots of the kuffaar by allowing the Muslims to fight and by granting them victory. It implies that He gave permission to fight to those who were able to fight, as is indicated by the context. Al-Dahhaak said: The companions of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked for permission to fight the kuffaar because they had persecuted them in Makkah, then Allaah revealed the words “Verily, Allaah likes not any treacherous ingrate to Allaah”. But after the Hijrah He revealed the words “Permission to fight (against disbelievers) is given to those (believers) who are fought against, because they have been wronged”, which abrogated everything in the Qur’aan about ignoring them and forgiving them. This is the first verse which was revealed about fighting. Ibn ‘Abbaas and Ibn Jubayr said: It was revealed when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) migrated to Madeenah. Al-Nasaa’i and al-Tirmidhi narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was expelled from Makkah, Abu Bakr said, “They have expelled their Prophet, they will surely be destroyed.” Then Allaah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Permission to fight (against disbelievers) is given to those (believers) who are fought against, because they have been wronged; and surely, Allaah is Able to give them (believers) victory”
[al-Hajj 22:39]
Abu Bakr said: “Then I knew that there would be fighting.”

Fourthly: 
The Muslim should give up his rights that a kaafir may have taken if insisting on his rights will result in a greater loss of his rights. 
The scholars mentioned that denouncing an evil action may be haraam if it will lead to a greater evil. 
I’laam al-Muwaqqi’een, 3/4 
Examples of that in the matter under discussion include the following. 
If Muslims live in a land where the majority are kaafirs, if one of the Muslims is mistreated, insulted or beaten by them, and his taking revenge will lead to the kaafirs wreaking vengeance on him and on his Muslim brothers, then it is wise for him to keep quiet, in the hope that this will be in the interests of the Muslims in that land. And he should seek reward for that with the One with Whom no deed, great or small, is ever lost. 
But if he can repay this evil and manifest the honour of Islam and the Muslims without that leading to a greater harm from them, then he must ward off that wrongdoing and show pride in his religion, and humiliate kufr and its people. 
And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
8895,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8895,He    committed zinaa then he became Muslim; should he be subjected to the       punishment?,"If a kaafir commits zinaa (unlawful sexual intercourse) then he becomes Muslim, should the hadd punishment be carried out on him?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If a dhimmi (Jew or Christian living under the protection of the Islamic state) commits zinaa then becomes Muslim, and there is evidence to prove that he did commit zinaa, the hadd punishment is no longer to be applied to him; he should not be punished by either hadd (punishment specified in sharee’ah) or ta’zeer (punishment to be specified by the qaadi or Muslim judge in a particular case). This was the view of al-Shaafa'i, based on the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say to those who have disbelieved, if they cease (from disbelief), their past will be forgiven” (al-Anfaal 8:38).
He also quoted as evidence the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him):
“Islam wipes out whatever came before it.” (Narrated by Muslim from ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas).
The Qur’aan also states that the punishment for a thief or bandit is no longer applicable if they repent, so this reprieve is more applicable in the case of a kaafir (who becomes Muslim). Moreover, enforcing the punishment would put people off Islam. This is the same reason which is given by scholars for stating that a person who enters Islam does not have to make up the prayers that he has missed. And Allaah knows best.","Fataawa al-Imaam al-Nawawi, 223"
