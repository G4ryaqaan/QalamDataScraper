37802,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/37802,Working on Saturdays and Sundays in Ramadaan,Is it OK to work on Saturday & Sunday during Ramadan?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Working on all the days of the week is permissible, in Ramadaan and at other times. Saturdays and Sundays are not days when working is forbidden for Muslims. 
The Muslim’s main concern should not be earning money and working at the expense of his prayer and fasting. So if a Muslim can reduce his worldly work without that causing harm to him or anyone else, then this is wise and is a good idea, to free the Muslim during this month to worship Allaah by fasting, praying qiyaam and reading Qur’aan.

2- There is no du`a that you should say when starting to fast each day. Rather you should simply have the intention that you are going to fast tomorrow.","Du`a for sighting new moon 


Is there any du`a when starting to fast every day?","Praise be to Allah.Du`a for sighting new moon 
Al-Tirmidhi (3451) narrated from Talhah ibn ‘Ubayd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw the new moon, he would say, “Allahumma ahillahu ‘alayna bi’l-yumni wa’l-iman wa’l-salamah wa’l-islam. Rabbiy wa rabbuka Allah (O Allah, make the new moon rise on us with blessing, faith, safety and Islam. My Lord and Your Lord is Allah).” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 2745)  
This du`a is not just for the new moon of Ramadan , rather the Muslim should say it when he sees the new moon at the beginning of every month. 
Is there any du`a when starting to fast every day?
With regard to saying du`a every day, there is no du`a that the Muslim should say when starting to fast each day. Rather he should simply have the intention that he is going to fast tomorrow . 
The intention is subject to the condition that it be made at night, before the dawn comes. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does not intend to fast before dawn, there is no fast for him.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 730)
According to a version narrated by al-Nasai (2334): “Whoever does not intend to fast from the night before, there is no fast for him.” (Classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 573)
What is meant is that whoever does not intend to fast and resolve to do so from the night before, his fast is not valid. 
The intention is an action of the heart. The Muslim should resolve in his heart that he is going to fast tomorrow. It is not prescribed for him to utter it out loud and say , “I intend to fast” and other phrases that have been innovated by some people.

2-Do the best that you can in your work, for Allaah loves when anyone does something for him to do it

37820,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/37820,Ramadaan fasting is not acceptable if one does not pray,I fast Ramadaan but I do not pray. Is my fasting valid?,,,"Praise be to Allah.The Ramadaan fast, and indeed any righteous deed, is not accepted if you do not pray. That is because not praying constitutes kufr as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Between a man and shirk and kufr there stands his giving up prayer.” Narrated by Muslim, 82. See also question no. 5208. 
No righteous deed is accepted from the kaafir, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We shall turn to whatever deeds they (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners) did, and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust”
[al-Furqaan 25:23] 
“If you join others in worship with Allaah, (then) surely, (all) your deeds will be in vain, and you will certainly be among the losers”
[al-Zumar 39:65]
al-Bukhaari narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever forsakes ‘Asr prayer, his deeds are in vain.” (al-Bukhaari, 553). What is meant by “his deeds are in vain” means that they become invalid and will not avail him anything. 
This hadeeth indicates that in the case of one who does not pray, Allaah will not accept any deed from him, so the one who does not pray will not benefit at all from his deeds, and no good deeds of his will ascend to Allaah. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said concerning the meaning of this hadeeth: “The apparent meaning of this hadeeth is that those who do not pray are of two types: those who do not pray at all, which renders all of their deeds invalid, and those who do not pray some days, which renders his deeds on that day invalid. So the loss of all good deeds happens to those who do not pray at all, and the loss of some deeds happens to those who miss some prayers.” From Kitaab al-Salaah, p. 65 
Our advice to the sister who asked this question is to repent to Allaah, to feel regret for her negligence in her duties towards Allaah for exposing herself to His wrath, anger and punishment. Allaah accepts the repentance of those among His slaves who repent to Him, and forgives their sins; indeed, He rejoices greatly at that. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has given glad tidings to those who repent when he said: “The one who repents from sin is like one who did not sin at all.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 4250; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah, 3424. 
So she should hasten to do ghusl and pray, so that she may become pure both inwardly and outwardly. She should not delay repentance and say, “I will repent tomorrow or after tomorrow, because she does not know when death will come. She should repent to Allaah before regret will be of no avail. 
“And (remember) the Day when the Zaalim (wrongdoer, oppressor, polytheist) will bite at his hands, he will say: ‘Oh! Would that I had taken a path with the Messenger (Muhammad).
Ah! Woe to me! Would that I had never taken so-and-so as a Khaleel (an intimate friend)!
He indeed led me astray from the Reminder (this Qur’aan) after it had come to me. And Shaytaan (Satan) is to man ever a deserter in the hour of need’”

Does this come under the same rulings as an ordinary menstrual period?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, it comes under the same rulings as an ordinary menstrual period, because the basic principle is that the blood which comes out of a woman is menstrual blood (hayd) unless it becomes apparent that it is the blood of istihaadah (irregular non-menstrual vaginal bleeding). 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about a woman who started to bleed nine days after the previous period. He said: 
When the hayd (menstruation) comes, it is hayd, whether that was a long time or a short time after the previous period. If she menstruates, then becomes pure (i.e., her period ends), then five or six or ten days later she gets another period, then she should stop praying because it is hayd (menstruation). The same applies every time she become pure then the period come again – she must stop praying.

You could have joined the congregation with the intention of praying ‘Isha’, then when the imam said the tasleem after the two rak’ahs, you could stand up and complete the last two rak’ahs. You cannot pray qiyaam before ‘Isha’, rather it should be done afterwards, and after the regular Sunnah of ‘Isha’. The prayers that you did were simply voluntary prayers and not qiyaam.  
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz was asked: 
If a Muslim comes to the mosque and finds the congregation praying Taraaweeh and he has not yet prayed ‘Isha’, should he pray with them, with the intention of praying ‘Isha’? 
He replied: 
There is nothing wrong with his praying with them with the intention of praying ‘Isha’, according to the more correct of the two scholarly views. When the imam says the tasleem he should stand up and complete his prayer. It was proven in al-Saheehayn from Mu’aadh ibn Jabal that he used to pray ‘Isha’, then he would go back to his people and lead them in ‘Isha’ prayer, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not denounce that. This indicates that it is permissible to offer a fard prayer behind someone who is praying a naafil prayer. In al-Saheeh it is also narrated that in the fear prayer, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) led one group in praying two rak’ahs then he said the tasleem and led the other group in praying two rak’ahs, then he said the tasleem, so the first one was his fard (obligatory) prayer and the second was naafil for him whilst they were praying fard. And Allaah is the source of strength. 
Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 12/181 
And the Shaykh also said: 
The Sunnah is to pray tahajjud – in Ramadaan and at other times – after the regular Sunnah of ‘Isha’, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do that. It makes no difference if the tahajjud is done in the mosque or at home.  
Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 11/368 
With regard to the Taraaweeh prayers that you have missed, you have the choice. If you want you can do them and if you want you can leave them. Taraaweeh is a naafil prayer, so you do not have to make it up as is the case with the five daily prayers.

So there is nothing wrong with your not praying Tarawih with the congregation . Allah knows the soundness of your intention and you may be rewarded even though you do not attend these nafl prayers, especially since you are not being negligent by not praying it.
Indeed sometimes a person may be kept busy with something that is more important, such as one who takes care of an elderly mother or orphan children who need to be looked after at such times. A person may be rewarded more if he is distracted from it by a good deed that needs to be done at that time. 
There is nothing wrong with praying Tarawih at home if you are unable to go to the mosque. 
It is not necessary to pray a specific number of rak`ahs , rather you should pray as many as you can manage. The Sunnah is to pray eleven rak`ahs.
If you pray two rak`ahs that is better than not praying. We ask Allah to compensate you with good for what you have missed and to record for you a reward that is greater than your praying Tarawih. 
Your letting your wife go and visit her mother and your taking care of your daughter are two great deeds for which you will be rewarded in sha Allah.

Does sinning break your fast?","Praise be to Allah.Prohibition of riba in Islam
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah and give up what remains (due to you) from Riba (from now onward) if you are (really) believers.” [al-Baqarah 2:278]
This is a call from Allah to give up riba and avoid it, because He has forbidden riba: 
“Allah has permitted trading and forbidden Riba”. [al-Baqarah 2:275 – interpretation of the meaning]
Consumption of riba is one of the causes of the humiliation of the Muslims, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: If you engage in ‘inah transactions, and are content with farming and hold on to the tails of cattle, and you forsake jihad for the sake of Allah, Allah will cause you to be humiliated and will not relieve you of that until you return to your Religion.”  (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 3462; classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Sahihah, 11)

Does sinning break your fast?
With regard to the fast of one who commits a major sin – such as buying shares in a riba-based bank – it is valid but is imperfect, and he may not attain the reward of fasting. 
Think about the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqun (the pious).” [al-Baqarah 2:183]
In this verse Allah mentions the reason why fasting is enjoined, which is as a means of fearing Allah by doing obligatory duties and avoiding haram things. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does not give up false speech and acting upon it, Allah has no need of his giving up his food and drink.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1903) In other words, Allah does not simply mean that we should give up our food and drink when fasting, rather He wants us to fear Him, because He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“… that you may become Al-Muttaqun (the pious)” [al-Baqarah 2:183] (See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/435)
Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“False speech and acting upon it” – what is meant by false speech is lying , and acting upon it means doing what is implied by that.  
Ibn al-‘Arabi said: what is meant by this hadith is that whoever does what is mentioned will not be rewarded for his fasting; the reward for fasting cannot outweigh the sin of false speech etc. 
Al-Baydawi said: the purpose behind the prescription of fasting is not just to be hungry and thirsty, rather the purpose is what that leads to of suppressing desires and taming one’s evil inclinations. If this is not achieved, then Allah will not regard it as acceptable. 
It was understood (by some) from this that these actions invalidate the fast.” (Fath al-Bari)

Yes, his fasting is valid. 
The scholars agreed that if a fasting person wakes up during the day, even if it is for a single moment, then his fasting is valid, but if he does not wake up and he sleeps all day whilst fasting , then the majority of scholars say that his fasting is still valid, because sleep does not invalidate fasting, as it does not mean that he is completely unconscious, rather if someone wakes him he will wake up. (Al-Majmu’, 6/346; al-Mughni, 4/344)

Tips for those who sleep a lot while fasting
The following is the advice of Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) to those who are fasting and others to make the most of their time and not to waste it sleeping. He said: 
“There is nothing wrong with sleeping during the day or the night, so long as that does not lead to missing out on any of the obligatory duties or committing any haram action. What is prescribed for the Muslim, whether he is fasting or not, is not to stay up late at night, and to hasten to sleep after doing whatever he is able to of qiyam al-layl , then he should get up for sahur if it is Ramadan, because eating sahur is a confirmed Sunnah as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Eat sahur, for in sahur there is barakah (blessing).” (Sahih – agreed upon) 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The thing that differentiates between our fasting and the fasting of the People of the Book is eating sahur.” (Narrated by Muslim in his Sahih) 
Those who are fasting and others must also adhere to offering the five daily prayers in congregation, and avoid being distracted from them by sleep or anything else. Those who are fasting and others must also do all their duties on time for the government or other duties, and not be distracted from them by sleep or anything else. And they must strive to seek halal provision which they and their dependents need, and not be distracted from that by sleep or anything else. 
In conclusion, my advice to everyone, men and women, those who are fasting and those who are not, is to fear Allah in all situations, and to continue to perform duties on time in the manner enjoined by Allah, and to avoid being distracted from that by sleep or any other permissible thing etc. If the thing that distracts them from that is an act of disobedience towards Allah, then the sin is greater and more serious. 
May Allah guide the Muslims, enable them to understand their religion and make them steadfast in adhering to the truth, and guide their leaders, for He is Most Generous, Most Kind.” (Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 4/15)

Expiation for intercourse while fasting","Praise be to Allah.Engaging with wife while fasting until ejaculation
You committed a sin by engaging in foreplay with your wife until you ejaculated, because by doing so you invalidated your fast and violated the sanctity of this blessed month, and you missed out on the reward of fasting, concerning which Allah says: “He gives up his desire and his food for My sake.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1761)
Your regret for the action that you did is repentance. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Regret is repentance.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 3558; Ibn Majah, 4252; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, 3429)
By ejaculating you broke your fast on the day when that happened, but you should refrain from eating and drinking for the rest of the day, until sunset. And you have to fast another day to make up for that day.
Expiation for intercourse while fasting
With regard to the kaffarah (expiation) , if you had had intercourse with your wife, the expiation would have been severe, namely freeing a slave. If you could not do that, then you would have to fast for two consecutive months. And if you could not do that, then you would have to feed sixty poor persons. 
 But if you ejaculated without having intercourse , then you do not have to offer expiation, rather you only have to make up that day.
 Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“If he kisses his wife or has intimacy without penetration , or touches the hand of a woman with his hand etc, then he ejaculates, he has broken his fast. Otherwise (his fast is not broken).” (Al-Majmu’, 6/322)
 Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“If (a man) touches his wife, whether he touches her with his hand, or with his face by kissing her, or with his private part (without having intercourse), then if he ejaculates he has broken his fast, but if he does not ejaculate then he does not break his fast thereby.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/388)
This ruling applies both to you and to your wife. If she reached climax as a result of this foreplay then she also broke her fast, and she has to repent to Allah and make up for this fast on another day. If she did not reach climax then she does not have to do anything.
