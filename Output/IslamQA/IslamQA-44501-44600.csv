44549,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/44549,Ruling on a Muslim woman marrying a Shi’i,"My cousin (daughter of my paternal uncle) is going to marry a Shi’i. What is the Islamic ruling on that? How can I persuade her not to go through with this marriage, knowing that her parents agree to it? Please advise me, may Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The Standing Committee was asked the following question: 

    We come from a tribe that lives on the northern borders [of 
    Saudi Arabia], and we mix with tribes from Iraq who are idolatrous Shi’ah; 
    they worship domes and call them al-Hasan and al-Husayn and ‘Ali. When one 
    of them stands up he says. “O ‘Ali, O Husayn.” Some people from our tribe 
    have intermarried with them and mix with them in all circumstances. We have 
    tried to teach them but they do not listen. I do not have enough knowledge 
    to teach them but I hate what they do, and I do not mix with them. I have 
    heard that we cannot eat meat slaughtered by them, but these people eat 
    their meat and do not care. We are asking you what are our obligations in 
    this case? 

    Answer: 
and blessings and peace be upon His 
    Messenger and his family and  companions. 
    
    If the situation is as you describe – that they call upon 
    ‘Ali, al-Hasan and al-Husayn, and so on – then they are mushrikeen who are 
    guilty of major shirk, which puts them beyond the pale of Islam. It is not 
    permissible for Muslim women to marry them, and it is not permissible for us 
    to marry their women, or to eat meat slaughtered by them. 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And do not marry Al-Mushrikaat (idolatresses) till they 
    believe (worship Allaah Alone). And indeed a slave woman who believes is 
    better than a (free) Mushrikah (idolatress), even though she pleases you. 
    And give not (your daughters) in marriage to Al-Mushrikoon till they believe 
    (in Allaah Alone) and verily, a believing slave is better than a (free) 
    Mushrik (idolater), even though he pleases you. Those (Al-Mushrikoon) invite 
    you to the Fire, but Allaah invites (you) to Paradise and forgiveness by His 
    Leave, and makes His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, 
    revelations, etc.) clear to mankind that they may remember”

    [al-Baqarah 2:221]
And Allaah is the Source of 
    strength. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and 
    his family and companions. 

    From Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 2/264 
You have to advise your 
    uncle and cousin, and tell them about the fatwas of the scholars concerning 
    this issue. If your uncle insists on marrying his daughter to a Shi’i, then 
    refer the matter to the sharee’ah court to prevent this evil action. 

    And Allaah knows best.

44555,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/44555,The distance at which it is prescribed to shorten one’s prayers and join them,My question has to do with a traveller’s prayers and shortening and joining prayers. I work in another city that is about 35 kilometers away from my city. Am I allowed to join or shorten my prayers – or to do both – because when I travel I leave the built-up area of the city where I live?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The majority of scholars defined the distance at which a traveller may shorten his prayers; and some of them did not set a limit, rather they left that to be decided by custom (al-‘urf) – what is customarily regarded by the people as travelling is where the concession is granted allowing the traveller to shorten his prayers and break his fast. 
According to the majority of scholars, the distance is defined as being approximately eighty kilometers. 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (8/99): The distance in which the concession of traveling is allowed is that which is customarily regarded as travelling, which is approximately eighty kilometers. Whoever is going to travel this distance or more is allowed to avail himself of the concessions granted to travellers, namely wiping over the socks for three days and nights, and joining and shortening prayers, and not fasting in Ramadaan. If this traveller intends to stay in a place for more than four days, then he is not allowed the concession of travel. If he intends to stay for four days or less, then he is allowed that concession. The traveller who stays in a place and does not know when he will finish what he came to do or how long he will be staying may avail himself of the concessions granted to the traveller, even if that is for a long time. And there is no difference between travel by land or by sea. 
From this it is known that you are not allowed to shorten your prayers for the distance mentioned, because it is not equal to the distance of traveling.

44593,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/44593,Fleeing to Madeenah From Tribulation,How can I flee to Madeenah to save myself from the tribulations that have appeared and become prevalent??,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is proven in the hadeeth (narration) of Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Madeenah is like a bellows that eliminates the dross and enhances the good elements.""
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6785; and Muslim, 1383. 
Al-Nawawi said: What this means is that those whose faith is contaminated will leave Madeenah and those whose faith is sincere will stay there. It is proven in the hadeeth of Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""There is no land that the Dajjaal (imposter) will not enter, apart from Makkah and Madeenah. At every path of them there are angels in ranks, guarding them. Madeenah will be shaken three times with its inhabitants, and Allaah will bring out of it every kaafir disbeliever and hypocrite."" Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1782; and Muslim, 160. 
And it was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""There will come a time when a man will say to his cousin and relatives, ‘Come to an easy life, come to an easy life,’ but Madeenah will be better for them if only they knew. By the One in Whose hand Hand is my soul, no one leaves Madeenah because he prefers to lives elsewhere but Allaah will replace him with someone who is better. Madeenah is like a bellows that brings out the dross. The Hour will not begin until Madeenah is cleansed of its evil people like the bellows cleanses iron of dross.""
Narrated by Muslim, 1381. 
These ahaadeeth (narrations) explain that no evil will remain in Madeenah and that it is always cleansed of its evil; the Dajjaal will never enter it, and it is a better for those who leave it for other places. 
But this does not necessarily mean that those who leave Madeenah have been tempted by the Shaytaan. Allaah has created the causes of remaining steadfast in adhering to truth and guidance, just as He has created the causes of going astray. Everything is in the hand Hand of Allaah, from beginning to end, and Allaah creates causes for everything. 
Some of the causes and means of remaining steadfast in adhering to guidance are as follows: 
1-     Remembering Allaah a great deal (dhikr), praying and reading Qur’aan
2-     Always making du’aa’ and asking Allaah to make one steadfast
3-     Keeping company with good people and sitting with righteous people
4-     Keeping away from situations and places that provoke desires and cause temptation
5-     Arming oneself with Islamic knowledge
6-     Calling people to Allaah (d’a’wah) and sacrificing that which is most precious for the sake of Allaah
7-     You should read the books Ways to Steadfast Faith and the book  , 33 Ways of Developing Khushoo’ in Salaah on this website (under Useful Material > Books).

44594,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/44594,Slandering and Accusing Muslims,"Our Shaykh, I love you for the sake of Allaah and I hope that you can tell me how to silence those who slander the scholars. There are people who accuse you of being extreme in labeling others as kaafirs (non-Muslims) and of Qutbiism (a group that claims to base its ideas on the writings of Sayyid Qutb) – as they call it. What is your answer? Please note that I am – as Allaah knows – one of those who love you for the sake of Allaah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.May Allaah love you, for Whose sake you love us, and may He bring us together in His mercy on the Day whereon neither wealth nor sons will avail, except him who brings to Allaah a clean heart (al-Shu’ara’ 26:89).   
With regard to what you have said in your question, we advise you to keep away from everyone who speaks about your Muslim brothers or slanders them, or accuses them and casts aspersion on their intentions. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O you who have spoken the words of faith but faith has not entered your hearts! Do not backbite about the Muslims or seek out their faults, for whoever seeks out their faults, Allaah will seek out his faults even if he is in his house.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, no. 4880; classed as saheeh (authentic) by al-Albaani. 
It is also necessary for you to advise these people to fear Allaah and refrain from using such labels and names that divide the Muslims. With regard to offering advice and correcting mistakes, this should not be done by means of exposing people’s faults or casting aspersions on their intentions etc. 
With regard to the issue of takfeer (labeling people as kaafirs - non-Muslims), this is subject to further discussion. Describing as a kaafir one who has been described as such by Allaah or by His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is obligatory. Allaah has described some groups as being kaafirs in His Book, as when He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Surely, disbelievers are those who said: ‘Allaah is the third of the three (in a Trinity)’”
[al-Maa’idah 5:73] 
“Surely, in disbelief are they who say that Allaah is the Messiah, son of Maryam (Mary)”
[al-Maa'idah 5:17]
But it is haraam (impermissible) to label as a kaafir someone whom Allaah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not label as such. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Just as it is not permissible to label a specific person as a kaafir unless the conditions of labeling someone as such have been met in his case, so too we should not shy away from labeling as kaafirs those whom Allaah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) have labeled as such. But we must differentiate between what is specific and what is general. 
Sharh Kitaab al-Tawheed, 2/281. 
See also question no. 21576. 
And Allaah knows best. 
Moreover, everyone who levels an accusation against another person must provide proof: 
“Say (O Muhammad), Produce your proof if you are truthful”
[al-Baqarah 2:111] 
“Since they produce not witnesses, they are the liars in the sight of Allaah”
[al-Noor 24:13]
This problem is widespread among some of those who claim to be religiously-guided, may Allaah guide them, for they make accusations against people on grounds that are not regarded as something worthy of criticism in sharee’ah or that do not undermine a person’s religious commitment.  
Then they do not bring any proof of that, and they follow their own whims and desires, because it is human nature to appoint oneself as judge, praising and condemning on a whim.   
We must go against the whims and desires of our own selves and measure people by the criteria set out in Islam; we should make mention of their good points and advise them with regard to their mistakes.
