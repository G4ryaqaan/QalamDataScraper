Should she prostrate when she is not covered, or what should she do?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is better for a woman if she comes across an aayah where a sajdah is prescribed to prostrate with her head covered, but if she does sajdat al-tilaawah without a cover, we hope that there is nothing wrong with that, because sajdat al-tilaawah does not come under the rulings on salah – rather it is an act of submission and drawing close to Allah, like all other kinds of dhikr and good deeds.

4910,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4910,"Funeral prayer in absentia, offering food to mourners and reading Qur’aan for the deceased","If a family member dies overseas, what should the family do overhere? 
1. can we perform the janaza prayer, that means there will be two janaza prayers, one overseas and one here. Is it allowed?  
2.  Are we allowed to read the quran together and hopefully the blessing will go to the deceased? 
3. Do we have to do a special Quran reading and invite people for a meal after three days and after 40 days also? This is being practiced back home and I am told that the spirit of the deceased  comes to the house for 40 days and wait to get all these blessings. 
When I was back home I used to practice this but now I am told that the Prophet sws and His companions never did it. I want to do the right thing. Please give quotations from quran and sunnah. And also if this practice is wrong, please advise what is the proper thing to do under this circumstance.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: if a relative or close friend dies 
          in another country, a person may travel to attend the funeral prayers 
          if that is easy to do. There is nothing wrong with this travelling because 
          it is travelling for a legitimate purpose, even though this action was 
          not known among Muslims in the past. It was not done in the past because 
          they were not able to do that, unlike today when travelling has become 
          easier with faster methods of transportation. 
 With regard to offering the funeral 
          prayer for the deceased in absentia, there is a great deal of difference 
          of opinion among the scholars on this matter, because it is not reported 
          that the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) did that, except in the case of the Negus (ruler 
          of Abyssinia), and it was not narrated that the Muslims outside of Madeenah 
          prayed for the Prophet  (peace and 
          blessings of Allaah be upon him) in absentia when he died, even though 
          their love for him was so great. 
 Also, it is not reported that the Muslims 
          prayed in absentia for any of the khulafaa’ al-raashideen (the rightly-guided 
          khaleefahs, the first four leaders of Islam after the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) when they died. Prayer 
          for the dead in absentia was not known among the Muslims even though 
          circumstances might have dictated it, such as the eagerness of the Muslims 
          to do something of benefit for their brothers, especially those who 
          were held in high esteem by all the Muslims, or one to whom one is related 
          or who one is fond of, which would make one seek to do something good 
          for him by praying for him. For this reason, scholars such as Shaykh 
          al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah were of the view that the fact that the Prophet 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) prayed for the Negus was an exceptional case which applied 
          only to him, because there was no one in the land where he died who 
          could offer the janaazah prayer for him. In my view, this is a sound 
          view in the light of the above. Some scholars say that the funeral prayer 
          in absentia may be offered only for certain people among the ummah, 
          such as famous scholars and just rulers; this view is close to the previous 
          view. 
 On this basis, there is no reason why 
          the funeral prayer should not be offered for the deceased both when 
          one is present and in absentia. 
 Secondly: 
Gathering to read Qur’aan and give the reward for that 
          to the deceased is a bid’ah (reprehensible innovation), even if it is 
          not done in return for any payment. If it is done in return for payment 
          then it is haraam, because it is being done for a reason other than 
          for the sake of Allaah, and any such action will not earn any reward. 
          But if a person reads Qur’aan by himself and gives the reward for that 
          to a relative or friend, without gathering with others for that purpose 
          and without seeking payment, then there are two scholarly views in this 
          case, one of which says that it is permissible and that the reward for 
          the reading will reach the deceased. 
 The second view is that it is not prescribed 
          to give the reward for the reading to anyone, because there is no evidence 
          (daleel) to indicate that this is prescribed. 
 Thirdly: 
If the family of the deceased have a special reading, 
          and invite people to a meal three days and forty days after the death, 
          this is bid’ah (reprehensible innovation). 
 And every bid’ah is a going astray. 
          The Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever invents something 
          in this matter of ours (i.e., Islam) that is not a part of it will have 
          it rejected.” The action mentioned is a matter that has been invented 
          in the religion, so it is to be rejected, and the one who does it is 
          a sinner and will not be rewarded. 
 What people say about the soul of the 
          deceased visiting the house after forty days to get the reward is a 
          lie which has no basis. The person who told you that the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his Companions did not 
          do any of these things was right. You did well to ask about the things 
          of which you were unsure, and your eagerness to know the Sunnah of the 
          Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
          Allaah be upon him) and act accordingly is highly commendable. This 
          is how the Muslim should be; his concern should be to know the truth 
          so that he can follow it, and know what is false so that he can avoid 
          it. 
 We ask Allaah to make us and you steadfast 
          in following the Straight Path. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad 
          and his family and companions, and grant them peace.",Islam Q&A - Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
4913,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4913,Do You Need Wudu for Sujud al-Tilawah?,"We noticed that some people do not think it is essential to be in a state of Taharah or to face the Qiblah when doing sajdat al-tilawah, and that others say that these are essential. Which view is correct?","The more correct opinion is that Sujud al-Tilawah is an act of worship, but it is not like prayer. So, it is not essential to be in a state of wudu or to face the qiblah when you offer sujud al-tilawah.",,"Praise be to Allah.“Some of the scholars regard Sujud al-Tilawah as being a form of prayer, and on this basis they say that it is essential to be in a state of taharah, to face the qiblah, to say Takbir when going down and when sitting up, and to say salam after the prostration. 
Other scholars say that Sujud al-Tilawah is an act of worship, but it is not like prayer, and on this basis they say that it is not essential to be in a state of taharah, to face the qiblah, etc., as stated before. This is the more correct opinion, because we do not know of any evidence to suggest that taharah and facing the Qiblah are essential, but if it is easy to face the Qiblah when doing the prostration and to be in a state of taharah, then this is better, so as to avoid dispute and to be in accordance with all the scholars.

4975,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4975,Responding to a    kaafir when he says salam to a Muslim,WHEN A NON-MUSLIM SAYS SALAM U ALAIKUM(GREETS YOU) HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO RESPOND?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Muslim reported in his Saheeh (14/144) from Anas ibn Malik that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When the People of the Book say salam to you (greet you by saying al-salamu alaykum), say ‘Wa ‘alaykum’ (and unto you).’” According to another report, he was asked, “The People of the Book say salam to us. How should we respond?” He said, “Say, ‘Wa ‘alaykum.’” According to another report (14/164), he said, “When the Jews greet you, they say ‘al-saam ‘alaykum (death be upon you). So say ‘ ‘alayk (upon you).’” According to another report he said, “So say, ‘wa ‘alayk’ (and upon you).” According to another report (14/146) a group of Jews asked for permission to enter upon the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and they said, “Al-saam ‘alaykum (death be upon you).” ‘Aa’ishah said, “Bal ‘alaykum al-saam wa’l-la’nah (No, death be upon you and curses)!” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “O ‘Aa’ishah, Allah loves gentleness in all things.” She said, “Did you not hear what they said?” He said, “I answered, ‘Wa ‘alaykum (and unto you).’” According to another report, he said, “I answered, ‘ ‘alaykum’” – without the “waw” (i.e., wa meaning “and”). According to the last hadeeth (14/148), he said, “Do not initiate the greeting of salam with the Jews and Christians, and if you meet one of them on the road, push him to the narrowest part of it.”
All of these reports were narrated in the Saheeh of Imaam Muslim.
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary (14/144-145):
The scholars agree that the greeting of the People of the Book should be returned, if they greet us with salam, but we should not say to them, “Wa ‘alaykum al-salam (and upon you be peace).” We should say only “ ‘alaykum (upon you)” or “wa ‘alaykum (and upon you).” Ahaadeeth have been narrated by Muslim both with and without the “wa” (“And”), but most of them include it. On this basis, there are two meanings, one of which is the apparent meaning: if they say “ ‘Alaykum al-mawt (death be upon you)”, then one should say, “Wa ‘alaykum (and also on you)” – meaning that we and you are alike, we are all going to die. The second meaning is that this is a waw that is used to start a new idea or phrase, not to connect it to the previous sentence or to reiterate the same idea. This implies: and upon you be what you deserve of condemnation. The phrase without the wa implies: but rather death should be upon you. Al-Qaadi said: some of the scholars, including Ibn Habeeb al-Maliki, preferred to use the phrase without the wa, so that it would not have the implication that these people are like the Muslims. Others said that it should be used with the wa as it appears in the majority of reports. Some of them said: he should reply “ ‘alaykum al-silaam (and upon you be stones) – but this is da’eef (weak). Al-Khattaabi said: most of the muhadditheen (scholars of hadeeth) reported it with the wa (wa ‘alaykum), but Ibn ‘Uyaynah reported it without the waw. Al-Khattaabi said: this is what is correct, because if the phrase is used without the waw, this means that what they are saying is returned specifically and exclusively to them, but if the waw is used, it implies commonality with them in what they are saying. This is the view of al-Khattaabi. But the correct view is that it is permissible either to use the waw or omit it, as both have been mentioned in saheeh reports, but including the waw is better, as it appears in most of the reports. There is nothing wrong with that, because al-saam means death, which will come to us and to them, so there is no harm in including the waw. The scholars differed as to returning the greeting of salam when a kaafir initiates it or initiating the greeting. Our opinion is that it is haraam to initiate the greeting, but we have to return their greeting by saying “Wa ‘alaykum” or just “ ‘alaykum.” Our evidence with regard to initiating the greeting is the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Do not initiate the greeting with the Jews and Christians” and his command to reply by saying, “Wa ‘alaykum.” What we have mentioned as our madhhab or point of view is also the opinion of most of the scholars and the majority of the salaf… It is permissible to initiate the greeting when addressed to a group composed of both Muslims and kaafirs, or one Muslim and a number of kaafirs, but he should intend the greeting to be directed towards the Muslim(s) among them, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) greeted an assembly that included a mixture of Muslims and mushrikeen.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
4983,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4983,Are the Sufi    shaykhs really in contact with Allaah?,"What is the place of sufism in Islam? What truth is there in 'religious experiences', contacts with the Divine, etc.? Some people hold such phenomena in high regard, claiming the similarities between experiences of people from different religions and from opposite corners of the globe, to be proof. How should people who claim to be sufis or believers/followers of sufism be seen? Isn't prayer and remembrance also a form of contact with the Almighty, SWT?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The word Sufism was not known at the time of the Messenger or the Sahaabah or the Taabieen. It arose at the time when a group of ascetics who wore wool (soof) emerged, and this name was given to them. It was also said that the name was taken from the word soofiya (sophia) which means wisdom in Greek. The word is not derived from al-safa (purity) as some of them claim, because the adjective derived from safa is safaai, not soofi (sufi). The emergence of this new name and the group to whom it is applied exacerbated the divisions among Muslims. The early Sufis differed from the later Sufis who spread bidah (innovation) to a greater extent and made shirk in both minor and major forms commonplace among the people, as well as the innovations against which the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned us when he said, Beware of newly-invented things, for every newly-invented thing is an innovation and every innovation is a going-astray. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is saheeh hasan).
The following is a comparison between the beliefs and rituals of Sufism and Islam which is based on the Quraan and Sunnah.
Sufism has numerous branches or tareeqahs, such as the Teejaniyyah, Qaadiriyyah, Naqshbandiyyah, Shaadhiliyyah, Rifaaiyyah, etc., the followers of which all claim that their particular tareeqah is on the path of truth whilst the others are following falsehood. Islam forbids such sectarianism. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
and be not of al-mushrikoon (the disbelievers in the Oneness of Allaah, polytheists, idolaters, etc),
Of those who split up their religion (i.e., who left the true Islamic monotheism), and became sects, [i.e., they invented new things in the religion (bidah) and followed their vain desires], each sect rejoicing in that which is with it. [al-Room 30:31-32]
The Sufis worship others than Allaah, such as Prophets and awliya [saints], living or dead. They say, Yaa Jeelaani, Yaa Rifaai [calling on their awliya], or O Messenger of Allaah, help and save or O Messenger of Allaah, our dependence is on you, etc.
But Allaah forbids us to call on anyone except Him in matters that are beyond the person's capabilities. If a person does this, Allaah will count him as a mushrik, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
And invoke not, besides Allaah, any that will neither profit you, nor hurt you, but if (in case) you did so, you shall certainly be one of the zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers). [Yoonus 10:106]
The Sufis believe that there are abdaal, aqtaab and awliya (kinds of saints) to whom Allaah has given the power to run the affairs of the universe. Allaah tells us about the mushrikeen (interpretation of the meaning):
Say [O Muhammad]: And who disposes the affairs? They will say. Allaah. [Yoonus 10:31]
The mushrik Arabs knew more about Allaah than these Sufis!
The Sufis turn to other than Allaah when calamity strikes, but Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And if Allaah touches you with harm, none can remove it but He, and if He touches you with good, then He is Able to do all things. [al-Anaam 6:17]
Some Sufis believe in wahdat al-wujood (unity of existence). They do not have the idea of a Creator and His creation, instead they say that everything is creation and everything is god.
The Sufis advocate extreme asceticism in this life and do not believe in taking the necessary means or in jihaad, but Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
But seek with that (wealth) which Allaah has bestowed on you, the home of the Hereafter, and forget not your portion of legal enjoyment in this world [al-Qasas 28:77]
And make ready against them all that you can of power   [al-Anfaal 8:60]
The Sufis refer the idea of ihsaan to their shaykhs and tell their followers to have a picture of their shaykh in mind when they remember Allaah and even when they are praying. Some of them even put a picture of their shaykh in front of them when they are praying. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Ihsaan is when you worship Allaah as if you can see Him, and although you cannot see Him, He can see you. (Reported by Muslim).
The Sufis allow dancing, drums and musical instruments, and raising the voice when making dhikr, but Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
The believers are only those who, when Allaah is mentioned, feel a fear in their hearts [al-Anfaal 8:2]
Moreover, you see some of them making dhikr by only pronouncing the Name of Allaah, saying, Allaah, Allaah, Allaah. This is bidah and has no meaning in Islam. They even go to the extreme of saying, Ah, ah or Hu, Hu. The Sunnah is for the Muslim to remember his Lord in words that have a true meaning for which he will be rewarded, such as saying Subhaan Allaah wa Alhamdulillah wa Laa ilaaha illa Allaah wa Allaahu akbar, and so on.
The Sufis recite love poems mentioning the names of women and boys in their dhikr gatherings, and they repeat words such as love, passion, desire and so on, as if they are in a gathering where people dance and drink wine and clap and shout. All of this has to do with the customs and acts of worship of the mushrikeen. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
Their salaah (prayer) at the House (of Allaah, i.e., the Kabah at Makkah) was nothing but whistling and clapping of hands
[al-Anfaal 8:35]
Some Sufis pierce themselves with rods of iron, saying, O my grandfather! So the shayaateen come to them and help them, because they are seeking the help of someone other than Allaah . Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And whosoever turns away (blinds himself) from the remembrance of the Most Beneficent (Allaah), We appoint for him a shaytaan (devil) to be a qareen (intimate companion) for him.
[al-Zukhruf 43:36]
The Sufis claim to have gnosis and knowledge of the unseen, but the Quraan shows them to be liars. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
Say: None in the heavens and the earth knows the ghayb (unseen) except Allaah [al-Naml 27:65]
The Sufis claim that Allaah created the world for the sake of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but the Quraan shows them to be liars. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And I (Allaah) created not the jinns and humans except they should worship Me (Alone). [al-Dhaariyaat 51:56]
Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, addressed His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with the words (interpretation of the meaning):
And worship your Lord until there comes unto the certainty (i.e., death). [al-Hijr 15:99]
The Sufis claim that they can see Allaah in this life, but the Quraan shows them to be liars. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
[Moosa said:] O my Lord! Show me (Yourself), that I may look upon You. Allaah said, You cannot see Me [al-Araaf 7:143]
The Sufis claim that they take knowledge directly from Allaah, without the mediation of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and in a conscious state (as opposed to dreams). So are they better than the Sahaabah??
The Sufis claim that they take knowledge directly from Allaah, without the mediation of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). They say, Haddathani qalbi an Rabbi (My heart told me from my Lord).
The Sufis celebrate Mawlid and hold gatherings for sending blessings on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but they go against his teachings by raising their voices in dhikr and anaasheed (religious songs) and qaseedahs (poems) that contain blatant shirk. Did the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) celebrate his birthday? Did Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, Ali, the four imaams or anyone else celebrate his birthday? Who knows more and is more correct in worship, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the Salaf, or the Sufis?
The Sufis travel to visit graves and seek blessings from their occupants or to make tawaaf (ritual circumambulation) around them or to make sacrifices at these sites, all of which goes against the teachings of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): Do not travel to visit any place but three mosques: al-Masjid al-Haraam [in Makkah], this mosque of mine [in Madeenah] and al-Masjid al-Aqsa [in Jerusalem]. (Agreed upon).
The Sufis are blindly loyal to their shaykhs, even when what they go against the words of Allaah and His Messenger. But Allaah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):
O you who believe! Do not put (yourselves) forward before Allaah and His Messenger [al-Hujuraat 49:1]
The Sufis use talismans, letters and numbers for making decisions and for making amulets and charms and so on.
The Sufis do not restrict themselves to the specific blessings on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that were narrated from him. They invented new formulas that involve seeking his blessings and other kinds of blatant shirk which are unacceptable to the one on whom they are sending blessings.
With regard to the question of the whether the Sufi shaykhs have some kind of contact, this is true, but their contact is with the shayaateen, not with Allaah, so they inspire one another with adorned speech as a delusion (or by way of deception), as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And so We have appointed for every Prophet enemies shayaateen (devils) among mankind and jinns, inspiring one another with adorned speech as a delusion (or by way of deception). If your Lord had so willed, they would not have done it [al-Anaam 6:112]
And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And, certainly, the shayaateen (devils) do inspire their friends (from mankind) [al-Anaam 6:121]
Shall I inform you (O people!) upon whom the shayaateen (devils) descend?
They descend on every lying, sinful person. [al-Shuara 221-222]
This is the contact that is real, not the contact that they falsely claim to have with Allaah. Exalted be Allaah far above that.
(See Mujam al-Bida, 346 359).
When some of these Sufi shaykhs disappear suddenly from the sight of their followers, this is the result of their contact with the shayaateen, who may even carry them to a distant place and bring them back in the same day or night, to mislead their human followers.
So the important rule here is not to judge people by the extraordinary feats that they may do. We should judge them by how closely or otherwise they adhere to the Quraan and Sunnah. The true friends of Allaah (awliya) are not necessarily known for performing astounding feats. On the contrary, they are the ones who worship Allaah in the manner that He has prescribed, and not by doing acts of bidah. The true awliya or friends of Allaah are those whom our Lord has described in the hadeeth qudsi narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh (5/2384) from Abu Hurayrah, who said:
The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Allaah said, Whoever shows enmity towards a friend (wali) of Mine, I declare war against him. My slave does not draw close to Me with anything more loved by Me than the religious duties that I have enjoined on him, and My slave continues to draw close to Me with supererogatory (naafil) acts, so that I will love him. When I love him, I am his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes and his foot with which he walks.

    become Muslim but she cannot accept some of the rulings such as hijaab and doing the
    prayers on time.","I was born in a French catholic family. My
      parents are strong and sincere believers, and I respect that a lot.Now I'm very interested in Islam, but there are a couple of reasons that
      ""prevent"" me from converting. For instance, as a woman, I cannot accept
      polygamy, the fact of stoning people who had an affair, of always depend on a
      ""mahram""...Furthermore, it's not ""easy"" to be and live as a Muslim in a
      western country : in my job, I wouldn't be able to wear a veil, not to shake men's hands
      anymore, pray 5 times a day... And my parents (especially my mother who is sick) would be
      very sad seeing me leaving Christianity.So my question is to know how I can convert in such conditions. Is there a
      kind of ""minimum"" required ? I mean, considering that there are still things
      which I don't accept, wouldn't it be better for me to wait ?Thanks for your help.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We put the following question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn
    Saalih al-Uthaymeen:
A non-Muslim woman is saying, I want to become Muslim but on the
    condition that I do not have to do the five prayers until the end of the day, because I
    cannot do them at work. And also I cannot accept the idea of polygamy.
He answered as follows:
I think that she should adhere to the rulings of
    Islam if she wants to become Muslim and be saved from the Fire. But as for her choosing
    what she wants and saying I cannot accept the idea of polygamy  as if she is saying
    that she cannot accept it as a ruling from Allaah  or saying I cannot pray until I
    finish my work, this is not acceptable.
    Question:
In the book Muntaqa al-Akhbaar, the author says,
    Chapter on the soundness of a persons Islam when he lays down invalid
    conditions, and he mentions the hadeeth of Waheeb, who said:
I asked Jaabir about the tribe of Thaqeef, when they gave their
    Bayah (oath of allegiance) to the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allâh be upon
    him), with the condition that they would not have to pay Sadaqah (charity) or engage in
    Jihaad. After that he heard the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allâh be upon him) say,
    They will give sadaqah and they will engage in jihaad.
Can we understand from this that if a non-Muslim comes and says I
    want to become Muslim on the condition that I can do all the prayers together at the end
    of the day this is OK, or is this an entirely different case?
Shaykh:
This is an entirely different case, because when that was said to the
    Messenger 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), he said, If they become
    Muslim, they will pray. This has to do with matters of the Unseen, which we cannot
    know. (in other words, the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) accepted
    that from them because he knew, from what Allaah taught him of the Unseen, that these
    people would become good Muslims and would give charity and engage in jihaad, whereas we
    cannot know the Unseen and how this non-Muslim will be in the future). If we accepted the
    conditions laid down by the kuffaar, Islam would disintegrate. One may stipulate the
    condition that we let him engage in zinaa (unlawful sexual activity), another may demand
    that we let him drink wine, and so on and so forth. The Messenger 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allâh be upon him) told Ali, when he sent him to the people of
    Khaybar: Tell them what their duties are towards Allaah in Islam. The
    condition of Islam is that it must be accepted in totality, as it is. The Prophet 
 (peace
    and blessings of Allâh be upon him) told Muaadh, Teach them that Allaah has
    enjoined five prayers upon them, and if they accept that, then tell them about
    Zakaah. So the obligations of Islam have to be accepted.
Question:
Can we not say that this persons entering Islam serves a great
    interest, and that their stipulating that they should be excused a few acts of worship is
    less harmful?
Shaykh: Not at all! Whose interests are being served here? The
    interests of the person himself? But this is damaging to Islam, because then lazy Muslims
    will say, We will only pray when we have finished work, like this person does.
    So the harm this would do to Islam is serious. If he really wants to save himself, let him
    accept Islam in totality. And whomsoever Allaah leads astray, no-one can
    guide.
So what we say to you is this: become Muslim and accept Islam in
    totality. Submit to Allaah in all that He has prescribed, and Allaah will help you and
    give you the strength to follow His laws, if you are sincere in your intention towards
    Him. Then if you are faced with something that you cannot do for a genuine reason, or are
    forced to do something, then if you are sincere, Allaah will not punish you for that. May
    Allaah help us and you to accept the truth and adhere to it. May Allaah bless our Prophet

    things forbidden in this world when they are permitted in Paradise?","Before I get to my question, I would
      like to introduce myself a little. I am a muslim girl in Sweden, who got a question from a
      christian person. I've asked everyone around me and tried to find the answer by looking
      in books, internet, but unfortunately whithout any results.The question was about huriyat
      (several women), according to what I've heard it is several women that the muslim men will
      be ""awarded"" with,in janna(heaven).I don't know if this information is right,
      but if you could give me a little bit more information about this, I would be thankful.
      The main question is: -Why does Islam encourage something in janna(heaven), which is
      forbidden here on earth?. Whith that he means, that a relationship outside marriage is according to Islam- haram (forbidden), if they(muslim
      men)avoid this on earth, they will be awarded with huriyat in janna. Isn't that very
      strange? Unfortunately a know very little about this subject, I don't know where he got
      this question, but I am sure there is a logical explanation for this question, which I
      hope to find answer to.I would be very grateful, if you could help me with this question,
      thank you for your time!",,,"Praise be to Allah.In His Holy Book, Allaah has mentioned Paradise and what
    He has prepared therein. He has mentioned the attributes of Paradise and of its people in
    numerous places in the Quraan, such as the aayaat (interpretation of the meaning):
Therein will be a running spring.
Therein will be thrones raised high.
And cups set at hand.
And cushions set in rows.
And rich carpets (all) spread out
[al-Ghaashiyah 88:12-16]
But for him who fears the standing before his Lord, there will
    be two Gardens (i.e. in Paradise). 
Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both (jinn and men)

With spreading branches.

In them (both) will be two springs flowing (free).
Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both (jinn and men)

In them (both) will be every kind of fruit in pairs.
[al-Rahmaan 55:46-52]
Wherein both will be Qaasiraat ut-Tarf [chaste females
    (wives) restraining their glances, desiring none except - their husbands], with whom no
    man or jinni has had Tamth [sexual intercourse] before them. 
Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both (jinn and men)
    deny?
(In beauty) they are like rubies and coral.
[al-Rahmaan 55:56-58]
Hoor (beautiful, fair females) guarded in pavilions
[al-Rahmaan 55:72]
And (there will be) Hoor (fair females) with wide lovely eyes
    (as wives for Al-Muttaqoon  the pious). 
Like unto preserved pearls.
A reward for what they used to do.
[al-Waaqiah 56:22-24]
There are many saheeh ahaadeeth from the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings
    of Allaah be upon him) which describe the women of Paradise and state that they will be
    prepared on the Day of Resurrection for the muttaqoon (pious). Among these
    ahaadeeth is the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said, the
    Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
The first group to enter Paradise will look like the moon on the
    night when it is full, then those who follow them will look like the brightest star in the
    sky; they will not urinate or defecate or spit or blow their noses. Their combs will be of
    gold and their sweat will be musk and their incense-burners will be pearls. Their wives
    will be al-hoor al-iyn. Their appearance will be the same and they will look
    like their father Adam who was sixty cubits tall.
(Saheeh al-Jaami, 2015).
It was also reported that he 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) said: A tent will be a pearl sixty miles high, in each corner of
    which will be a wife for the believer whom no one else will see. (Saheeh
    al-Jaami, 3357). 
    In these ahaadeeth the women of Paradise are mentioned
    who have been prepared for the men. In His Book, Allaah called them al-Hoor. Al-Hoor
    is the plural of Hooraa . Al-Qurtubi said in al-Ahkaam (17/12):
    (This means) a woman in whose eyes the white is intensely white and the black is
    intensely black. We believe in that with absolute faith uncontaminated with any
    doubts. It is part of the essentials of our belief. For more information see Saheeh
    al-Bukhaari, Kitaab Bad al-Khalq, Baab Sifat al-Jannah; and Saheeh
    Muslim, Abwaab Sifat al-Jannah; and Sifat al-Jannah by
    Abul-Naeem al-Isfahaani, which describes the women of the people of Paradise
    and their beauty.
With regard to the question about why Islam encourages and gives glad
    tidings of things in Paradise which are forbidden in this world, such as men having
    intimate relationships with women outside of the framework of marriage  before we
    answer this question, we must make a serious point, which is that Allaah forbids whatever
    He wills in this world to its people, for He is the Creator and Sovereign of these things,
    so it is not permissible for anyone to object to the ruling of Allaah on the basis of his
    foolish thinking and imperfect understanding. The ruling and the decision of the matter,
    before and after, is only with Allaah, and there is none who can overturn His ruling, may
    He be glorified and exalted.
With regard to the question of why Allaah forbids some things in this
    world, then in the Hereafter will permit them as a reward to those who abstained from them
    (such as wine, zinaa, wearing silk for men, etc.), this is what Allaah wills to give as a
    reward to those who obey Him and patiently strive in this world. Allaah says
    (interpretation of the meaning):
Is there any reward for good other than good?
    [al-Rahmaan 55:60]
With regard to the reason why these things are forbidden, there follow
    a few important points:
Firstly:
We do not necessarily know all the reasons why things are forbidden.
    There are some reasons which we do not know. The basic principle is to accept and submit
    to the texts even if we do not know the reason, because submission is the point of Islam
    which is based on complete obedience to Allaah, may He be exalted.
Secondly:
Some of the reasons for the prohibitions may be clear to us, such as
    the corruptions that result from zinaa, e.g., the mixing of lineages, the spread of fatal
    diseases and so on. When Islam forbids unlawful relationships, the intention is to protect
    peoples lineage and honour, which may not mean anything to the kaafirs and immoral
    people, who jump on one another like donkeys, with a boyfriend having intercourse with his
    girlfriend and people having intercourse with their own relatives and so on, as if they
    are in the jungle. Indeed, they are worse than animals, for some animals refuse to do such
    a thing, but these people do not refuse and do not care. As a result of this promiscuity,
    the ties that bind society disintegrate and it becomes filled with fatal sexual diseases
    which are an indication of the wrath of Allaah towards those who violate His sacred limits
    and make permissible that which is forbidden.
This is unlike the relationship of a man with the Hooris in
    Paradise  which is what has been asked about here  for we may note that in the
    case of a promiscuous woman in this world, her honour is readily available to all and she
    has no religious commitment or shame. She is not bound by a lawful relationship to one
    person. So men and women have intercourse with whomever they want, with no restrictions of
    religion or morality. But the hooris in Paradise are restrained and restricted to
    their husbands to whom Allaah has given them as a reward for their patience in abstaining
    from haraam things in this world. As Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings):
Hoor (beautiful, fair females) guarded in pavilions
[al-Rahmaan 55:72]
with whom no man or jinni has had Tamth [sexual intercourse]
    before them. [al-Rahmaan 55:56]
The hoori is a wife for the man, as Allaah says (interpretation
    of the meaning):
 and We shall marry them to Hooris [female fair ones]
    with wide, lovely eyes [al-Dukhaan 44:54].
And they will be confined to their husbands, and no one else will have
    a share in them.
Thirdly:
Allaah  who has declared that in this world a man is not
    permitted to have more than four wives at one time  is the One Who will bless the
    people of Paradise with whatever He wills of al-hoor al-iyn. So there is no
    contradiction between what is forbidden in this world and in the Hereafter, because the
    rulings of each are different, in accordance with what the Lord wills. Undoubtedly the
    Hereafter is far better and more lasting than this world. Allaah says (interpretation of
    the meaning):
Beautified for men is the love of things they covet; women,
    children, much of gold and silver (wealth), branded beautiful horses, cattle and
    well-tilled land. This is the pleasure of the present worlds life; but Allaah has
    the excellent return (Paradise with flowing rivers) with Him.
Say: Shall I inform you of things far better than those? For
    Al-Muttaqoon (the pious) there are Gardens (Paradise) with their Lord, underneath which
    rivers flow. Therein (is their) eternal (home) and Azwaajun Mutahharatun (purified mates
    or wives). And Allaah will be pleased with them. And Allaah is All-Seer of the (His)
    slaves.
[Aal Imraan 3:14-15]
Fourthly:
This prohibition may be a kind of test from Allaah to His slaves, to
    see whether they will obey these commands and avoid that which He has forbidden. The test
    could not be with regard to something for which people have no inclination and which they
    do not like; it has to be with regard to something to which they are inclined and
    attracted. This testing may include wealth  will a person take from that which is
    permitted and dispose of it in manners which are permitted, and will he fulfil the rights
    which Allaah has over it? The test with regard to women is: will he restrict himself to
    that which Allaah has permitted him of women, and will he lower his gaze and avoid seeking
    pleasure in that which Allaah has forbidden. It is an aspect of Allaahs mercy 
    may He be exalted and glorified  that He does not forbid something to which people
    are inclined without allowing something of that nature and there is much which is
    permitted.
Fifthly:
The rulings (ahkaam) of this world are not like the rulings of
    the Hereafter. The wine of this world causes people to lose their minds, unlike the good
    wine of the Hereafter which does not make people lose their minds or cause headaches or
    stomachaches. What Allaah has prepared for the believers of women on the Day of
    Resurrection as a reward for their obedience is not like zinaa which violates
    peoples honour, confuses lineages, spreads diseases and leads to regret. The women
    of Paradise are pure and good; they will never die or get old, unlike the women of this
    world. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
Verily, We have created them (maidens) of special creation.
And made them virgins.
Loving (their husbands only), (and) of equal age
[al-Waaqiah 56:35]
We ask Allaah to bless us with the best of this world and the next, and
    to help us to be obedient to His commands and to have certain faith in His reward and to
    keep us safe from His punishment. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

It is like the things said by the people who follow innovations and are misguided, so that they say that it is makrooh to get married when the moon is in Scorpio or when it is under the rays [???], or when it is waning or in any of its other stages.
(See Mu’jam al-Bida’ by Raa’id Sabri, 656).
Allaah has permitted intercourse at all times and in all places, with the following exceptions:


During the day in Ramadaan. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “It is made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of al-siyaam (the fasts). They are libaas (body cover, screen, etc.) for you and you are the same for them. Allaah knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He turned to you (accepted your repentance) and forgave you. So now have sexual relations with them and seek that which Allaah has ordained for you (offspring)…” [al-Baqarah 2:187]


During the woman’s period [hayd] and when she is still bleeding after childbirth [nifaas]. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “They ask you concerning menstruation. Say: that is an adha (a harmful thing for a husband to have a sexual intercourse with his wife while she is having her menses), therefore keep away from women during menses and go not unto them until they have purified (from menses and have taken a bath). And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as Allaah has ordained for you…” [al-Baqarah 2:222]


In the mosques. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… And do not have sexual relations with them (your wives) while you are in I’tikaaf (i.e., confining oneself in a mosque for prayers and invocations leaving the worldly activities) in the mosques. These are the limits (set) by Allaah, so approach them not…” [al-Baqarah 2:187]




And in other situations, such as when one is muhrim (in a state of ihraam for Hajj or ‘Umrah). You will not find anything in the Qur’aan or Sunnah to confirm this lie. It is a kind of evil falsehood that has cheated a lot of people, so that now they hold it as some kind of inflexible belief. Many people have had intercourse with their wives on a Tuesday and have conceived healthy children. No harm has befallen either them or their children because of that. May Allaah protect us and you from bid’ah and evil. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
