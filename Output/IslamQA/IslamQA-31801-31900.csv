31803,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/31803,She continued to bleed after she gave birth so she did not pray; should she make up the days that she missed after forty days from the birth?,"I did not pray until sixty days after the birth of my child, because the bleeding did not stop until then, and I was unaware that the woman becomes pure after forty days and has to start praying. I did not come to know of this ruling until nine months after giving birth.
What should I do about the twenty days when I did not pray? If I have to make up those prayers, when should I do that?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The scholars differed as to the maximum length of nifaas (post-partum bleeding). Some of them said that the maximum length of nifaas is forty days, because of the hadeeth of Umm Salamah (may Allaah be pleased with her): “At the time of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), women in nifaas used to stay (not praying etc) for forty days” – narrated by Abu Dawood, 139; al-Albaani said it is hasan saheeh. This is the view of the majority. 
So she should pray after that even if she continues to bleed, and she should make up the prayers that she missed, so long as the bleeding that comes after forty days does not coincide with the time of her monthly period. See question no. 10488. 
Some of the scholars, such as Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, said that the basis principle regarding blood that comes out because of childbirth is that it is nifaas, so she should not pray until the bleeding stops, and he said there is no maximum limit for nifaas. 
Some of then said that the maximum length of nifaas is sixty days. This is the view of al-Shaafaa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him). 
In order to be on the safe side, you should make up the prayers that you missed after forty days, apart from the time that coincided with your monthly period. And Allaah knows best. 
With regard to how the prayers should be made up: you have to do that as soon as this ruling reaches you. If it is difficult because of the large number of prayers involved, you can make them up as you are able to, even if that takes several days. And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A

Weighing people on the Day of Judgement","Praise be to Allah.Distribution of the books of deeds on the Day of Judgement
When people have been brought to account for their deeds, each person will be given their book that contains the record of all his deeds. The believer will be given his book in his right hand, as a sign of honour. He will be the one who is saved and happy on the Day of Resurrection. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Then as for him who will be given his Record in his right hand, He surely, will receive an easy reckoning, And will return to his family in joy!” [Al-Inshiqaq 84:7-9] 
“Then as for him who will be given his Record in his right hand will say: ‘Here! Read my Record! Surely, I did believe that I shall meet my Account!’ So he shall be in a life, well-pleasing. In a lofty Paradise, The fruits in bunches whereof will be low and near at hand. Eat and drink at ease for that which you have sent on before you in days past!” [Al-Haqqah 69:19-24]
But the disbelievers, hypocrites and followers of misguidance will be given their books in their left hands , from behind their backs. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But whosoever is given his Record behind his back, He will invoke (for his) destruction,
And he shall enter a blazing Fire” [Al-Inshiqaq 84:10-12] 
“But as for him who will be given his Record in his left hand, will say: ‘I wish that I had not been given my Record! And that I had never known how my Account is! Would that it had been my end (death)! My wealth has not availed me; My power (and arguments to defend myself) have gone from me!’ (It will be said): ‘Seize him and fetter him; Then throw him in the blazing Fire. Then fasten him with a chain whereof the length is seventy cubits!’” [Al-Haqqah 69:25-32]
When the people have been given their books, it will be said to them: 
“This Our Record speaks about you with truth. Verily, We were recording what you used to do (i.e. Our angels used to record your deeds).” [Al-Jathiyah 45:29] 
“Read your book. You yourself are sufficient as a reckoner against you this Day.” [Al-Isra 17:14]
The Balance of weighing deeds
The Balance will be set up to weigh people’s deeds . Al-Qurtubi said: “When the Reckoning is completed, then people’s deeds will be weighed, because the weighing has to do with reward and punishment. So it is apt that it should come after the Reckoning. The Reckoning is to evaluate the deeds, and the weighing is to determine the amount of reward or punishment.” 
The texts indicate that the Balance is a real Balance, with two pans, in which people’s deeds will be weighed. It is a huge Balance, the size of which is known only to Allah. The scholars differed as to whether it is one Balance in which people’s deeds will be weighed, or whether there are numerous Balances, so that each person will have his own Balance. Those who said that there will be numerous balances quote as evidence the fact that the word appears in plural form in some verses, for example (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We shall set up Balances of justice on the Day of Resurrection, then none will be dealt with unjustly in anything. And if there be the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it. And Sufficient are We to take account.” [Al-Anbiya 21:47]
Those who say that it will be one Balance quote as evidence the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “The Balance will be set up on the Day of Resurrection, and if the heavens and the earth were to be weighed in it, it would be sufficient to carry them. And the angels will say, ‘O Lord, who is this for?’ Allah will say, ‘For whomsoever I will from among My slaves.’” (al-Silsilat al-Sahihah, 941). They interpret the verse in which the plural form is mentioned as referring to the large number of things to be weighed, namely words, deeds, records and people.  
Weighing words on the Day of Judgement
One of the things that indicate that words will also be weighed is the hadith narrated by Abu Hurayrah, according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Two words which are light on the tongue but will weigh heavily in the Balance and are beloved to the Most Merciful: Subhan Allah il-‘Azim, Subhan Allahi wa bi Hamdihi (Glory be to Allah the Almighty, Glory and praise be to Allah).” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6406) 
Weighing deeds on the Day of Judgement
The fact that deeds will be weighed is indicated by the sahih hadith narrated from Abu’l-Darda who said: “I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, ‘There is nothing that will be placed in the Balance that will weigh more heavily than a good attitude. The one who has a good attitude will attain thereby the status of one who fasts and prays (a great deal).’” (Sahih Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 1629) 
Weighing books of deeds on the Day of Judgement
Another thing that indicates that the books of deeds will be weighed is the hadith of al-Bitaqah from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As who said, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah will separate a man belonging to my ummah in the presence of all creatures and will spread ninety-nine scrolls for him, each scroll extending as far as the eye can see. Then He will say, ‘Do you object to anything in this? Have my scribes who keep note wronged you?’ He will say, ‘No, my Lord.’ He will ask him, ‘Do you have any excuse?’ He will say, ‘No my Lord.’ Allah will say, ‘On the contrary, you have with Us a good deed , and you will not be wronged this Day.’ A slip of paper will then be brought out, on which are the words ‘Ashhadu an la ilaha ill-Allah wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan ‘abduhu wa rasuluhu  (I  bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger).’ Allah will say, ‘Bring your weight (i.e., the scrolls).’ The man will say, ‘O Lord, what is this slip of paper in comparison to these scrolls?’ And He will reply, ‘You will not be wronged.’ The scrolls will then be put in one side of the Balance and the slip of paper in the other, and the scrolls will become light and the slip of paper heavy, for nothing could compare in weight to the name of Allah.” (Sahih Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 2127)  
Weighing people on the Day of Judgement
One of the things that indicate that people will be weighed is the hadith narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A huge fat man will be brought on the Day of Resurrection, and he will not weigh more before Allah than the wing of a gnat. Recite: ‘and on the Day of Resurrection, We shall assign no weight for them’ [Al-Kahf 18:105 – interpretation of the meaning].” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4729)
It is also indicated by the fact that Ibn Mas’ud was trying to break a siwak branch from an arak tree and he had thin legs and the wind started to buffet him, so the people laughed at him. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “What are you laughing at?” They said, “O Prophet of Allah, because his legs are so thin.” He said, “By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, they will weigh more heavily in the Balance than Mount Uhud.” Its isnad was classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sharh al-Tahhawiyyah, no. 571, p. 418
 We ask Allah to make us weigh heavily in the Balance.

9.	Whoever believes that some people are allowed to operate outside the law of Muhammad.
10.	Turning away from the religion of Allah, not learning it and not acting in accordance with it.",,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Note that Allah has commanded all people to enter Islam and to adhere to it and to beware of whatever is contrary to it. He sent His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to call mankind to that. He tells us that those who follow him will be guided and that those who turn away from him have gone astray.
In many verses He warns against the means that lead to apostasy and all forms of polytheism and disbelief .
The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) have said, when discussing apostasy, that a Muslim may apostatize from his religion by doing many acts that nullify Islam, which makes it permissible to shed his blood and seize his wealth, and which will put him beyond the pale of Islam. 
Among the most serious and most common of these things are ten which were mentioned by Shaykh Muhammad ibn `Abd Al-Wahhaab and other scholars (may Allah have mercy on them all). 
We will mention them in brief here, so that you and others can beware of them, in the hope that you will be safe and sound. We will also explain a little about them after mentioning each one.  

Shirk or associating others in worship with Allah . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Verily, Allah forgives not (the sin of) setting up partners (in worship) with Him, but He forgives whom He wills, sins other than that, and whoever sets up partners in worship with Allah, has indeed strayed far away.” [An-Nisa’ 4:116] 
“Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allah, then Allah has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:72]
That includes praying to the dead, seeking their help, making vows and offering sacrifices to them or to the jinn or to the grave. 

Whoever sets up intermediaries between himself and Allah and calls upon them, asks them to intercede, and puts his trust in them, is a disbeliever according to scholarly consensus. 
Whoever does not regard the polytheists as disbelievers, or doubts that they are disbelievers, or regards their way as correct, is a disbeliever. 
Whoever believes that anything other than the teaching of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is more complete than his teachings , or that the rulings of anyone else are better than his rulings – such as those who prefer the rule of false laws to his rulings – is a disbeliever. 
Whoever hates any part of that which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) brought, even if he acts in accordance with it, is a disbeliever, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“That is because they hate that which Allah has sent down (this Quran and Islamic laws); so He has made their deeds fruitless.” [Muhammad 47:9]

Whoever makes fun of anything in the religion of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or makes fun of any texts that refer to rewards or punishments, is a disbeliever. The evidence for that is the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Say: Was it at Allah, and His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger that you were mocking?
Make no excuse; you disbelieved after you had believed.” [At-Tawbah 9:65-66]

Witchcraft – including spells to turn one person against another or to make someone love another. Whoever does this or approves of it is a disbeliever. The evidence for that is the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 

“but neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, `We are for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).’” [Al-Baqarah 2:102]

Supporting the polytheists and helping them against the Muslims. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Awliya’ (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Awliyaa’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them (as Awliya’), then surely, he is one of them. Verily, Allah guides not those people who are the Dhalimun (polytheists and wrongdoers and unjust)” [Al-Ma'idah 5:51]

Whoever believes that some people are allowed to operate outside the law of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) just as Al-Khidr operated outside the law of Musa (peace be upon him) is a disbeliever, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.” [Al `Imran 3:85]

Turning away from the religion of Allah, not learning it and not acting in accordance with it. The evidence for that is the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And who does more wrong than he who is reminded of the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of his Lord, then turns aside therefrom? Verily, We shall exact retribution from the Mujrimon (criminals, disbelievers, polytheists, sinners).” [As-Sajdah 32:22]
With regard to all of these acts that nullify Islam, it makes no difference whether a person is joking, serious or afraid, unless he is forced to do it. All of them are very serious, and they all happen a great deal. 
The Muslim should beware of them and fear falling into them. We seek refuge with Allah from the things that may incur His wrath and painful punishment. May Allah send blessings and peace upon the best of His creation, Muhammad, and upon his family and companions. 

The fourth category includes those who believe that the systems and laws devised by men are better than the Shari`ah of Islam, or equal to it; or that it is permissible to refer to them for judgements and rulings, even if he believes that referring to Shari`ah is better; or that the Islamic system is not fit to be applied in the twentieth century; or that it was the cause of the Muslims’ backwardness; or that it should be limited to a person’s relationship with his Lord and not have anything to do with the other affairs of life 
The fourth category also includes those who think that carrying out the ruling of Allah by cutting off the hand of the thief or stoning the married adulterer is not appropriate in the modern age. 
That also includes: everyone who believes that it is permissible to rule according to something other than the laws of Allah with regard to interactions, hudud punishments or other matters, even if he does not believe that that is better than the ruling of Shari`ah, because by doing so he is regarding as permissible something that Allah has forbidden according to consensus, and everyone who regards as permissible something that Allah has forbidden and is well known to be forbidden in Islam, such that no Muslim has any excuse for not knowing that it is forbidden, such as adultery , alcohol and Riba , and ruling by something other than the Shari`ah of Allah, is a disbeliever according to the consensus of the Muslims. 

We ask Allah to help us all to do that which pleases Him, and to guide us and all the Muslims to His Straight Path, for He is All Hearing, Ever-Responsive. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.",Islam Q&A
31819,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/31819,What Is ‘Umrah?,I want to know about `Umrah in detail.,"`Umrah is composed of four things, namely: ihram, circumambulation of the Sacred House (tawaf), sa`i between al-Safa and al-Marwah, and shaving the head or cutting the hair.","Conditions of accepting acts of worship


What is ‘Umrah?


Ihram


Tawaf 


Sa`i


Shaving the head or cutting the hair","Praise be to Allah.Conditions of accepting acts of worship
An act of worship cannot be accepted unless it meets two conditions: 

Sincerity towards Allah Alone, i.e., it is done to seek the Countenance of Allah and the Hereafter, and is not done to show off, to enhance one’s reputation or for worldly gain. 
Following the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in word and deed. Following the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) can only be achieved by knowing his Sunnah 

Hence the one who wants to worship Allah by doing any act of worship – Hajj or anything else – has to learn the teachings of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning it, so that his actions will be in accordance with the Sunnah. 
What is ‘Umrah?
We will sum up in these few lines the description of `Umrah as narrated in the Sunnah. 
`Umrah is composed of four things, namely: ihram, circumambulation of the Sacred House (tawaf), sa`i between al-Safa and al-Marwah, and shaving the head or cutting the hair. 
Ihram
Ihram means having the intention of starting the rituals of Hajj or `Umrah . 
When the pilgrim wants to enter ihram , he should change his clothes and do ghusl like the ghusl done to cleanse oneself of janabah (impurity following sexual activity). Then he should apply whatever perfume is available, musk or whatever, to his head and beard. It does not matter if traces of that perfume remain after he enters ihram, because of the hadith narrated in al-Sahihayn from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wanted to enter ihram, he would perfume himself with the best perfume he could find, then I would see shining traces of that musk on his head and beard after that.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 271; Muslim, 1190)  
Doing ghusl when entering ihram is Sunnah for both men and women, even women who are bleeding following childbirth or menstruating, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded Asma bint ‘Umays when she was bleeding following childbirth to do ghusl when she entered ihram, and to bandage her private parts and enter ihram. (Narrated by Muslim, 1209)
Then after doing ghusl and putting on perfume, the pilgrim should put on the ihram garments and – apart from women who are bleeding following childbirth or menstruating – pray the obligatory prayer if that is at the time of an obligatory prayer, otherwise they should  pray two rak’ahs with the intention of the Sunnah prayer of wudu. When the pilgrim has finished praying he should face the qiblah and enter ihram. He may delay ihram until he has boarded his means of transportation, and is ready to move off, but he should enter ihram before he leaves the miqat for Makkah. 
Then he should say, Labbayk Allahumma bi `Umrah (Here I am, O Allah, for `Umrah).
 Then he should recite the Talbiyah as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did: “Labbayka Allahumma labbayk , labbayka la sharika laka labbayk. Inna al-hamd wa’l-ni’mata laka wa’l-mulk, la sharika lak  (Here I am, O Allah, here I am. Here I am, You have no partner, here I am. Verily all praise and blessings are Yours, and all sovereignty, You have no partner).” 
The Talbiyah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also included the words, “Labbayka ilah al-haqq (Here I am, O God of Truth).”
 Ibn `Umar used to add to the Talbiyah the words, “Labbayk wa sa’dayka, wa’l-khayr bi yadayka, wa’l-raghba ilayka wa’l-‘aml (Here I am and blessed by You, and all good is in Your Hands, and desire and action are directed towards You).” 
Men should raise their voices when saying that, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibril came to me and told me to tell my Companions and those who are with me to raise their voices when reciting the Talbiyah.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 1599) And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of Hajj is that in which voices are raised in the Talbiyah and the blood of the sacrificial animal flows.” (Classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 1112) 
A woman should recite in such a manner that those who are beside her can hear it, unless there is a man beside her who is not one of her mahrams, in which case she should recite it silently. 
If the person who is entering ihram fears some obstacle that may prevent him from completing his pilgrimage (such as sickness, an enemy, being stopped from proceeding any further, etc), then he should stipulate a condition when entering ihram by saying, “If I am prevented then my exiting ihram is where I am prevented” – i.e., if something prevents me from completing my pilgrimage such as sickness or delay etc, then I will exit my ihram. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded Duba’ah bint al-Zubayr, when she wanted to enter ihram but she was sick, to stipulate such a condition, and he said, “Your condition is valid with your Lord.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5089, and Muslim, 1207) 
If he stipulates this condition and something happens to prevent him from completing his pilgrimage, then he can exit his ihram and does not have to do anything (i.e., offer a sacrifice in compensation). 
But the one who does not fear that some obstacle may prevent him from completing his pilgrimage does not have to stipulate any conditions, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not stipulate conditions nor did he command everyone to do so. Rather he told Duba’ah bint al-Zubayr to do that because she was sick. 
The muhrim (person who has entered ihram) should recite the Talbiyah a great deal, especially when circumstances and times change, such as when going up to a high place or going down to a low place, or when night or day begin. After that he should ask Allah for His good pleasure and for Paradise, and seek refuge in His Mercy from the Fire. 
The Talbiyah is prescribed in `Umrah from the moment one enters ihram until one starts tawaf. When he starts tawaf he should stop reciting the Talbiyah. 

Ghusl when entering Makkah 

When the pilgrim approaches Makkah, he should do ghusl before entering, if possible, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did ghusl when he entered Makkah. Narrated by Muslim, 1259.
Tawaf 
Then when he enters al-Masjid al-Haram he should do so with his right foot first, and say, “Bismillah wa’l-salatu wa’l-salam ‘ala Rasul-Allah. Allahumma ighfir li dhunubi waftah li abwab rahmatika. A’udhu Billah il-‘Azim wa bi wajhih il-karim wa bi sultanih il-‘qadim min al-Shaytan il-rajim (In the name of Allah, and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allah. O Allah, forgive me my sins and open to me the gates of Your mercy. I seek refuge with Allah the Almighty and in His noble Countenance and His eternal power from the accursed Satan).” Then he should go to the Black Stone in order to start tawaf . He should touch the Stone with his right hand and kiss it; if he cannot kiss it then he should touch it with his hand and kiss his hand. If he cannot touch it with his hand then he should face the Stone and point to it with his hand and say “Allahu akbar”, but he should not kiss his hand. 
There is a great deal of virtue in touching the Black Stone , because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah will raise up the Black Stone on the Day of Resurrection and it will have two eyes with which it will see and a tongue with which it will speak, and it will bear witness for those who touched it in sincerity.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Targhib wa’l-Tarhib, 1144)
It is better not to crowd around and cause annoyance to people or be annoyed by them, because of the hadith in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to ‘Umar: “O `Umar, you are a strong man, do not crowd around the Stone and disturb the weak. If you find space, then touch it, otherwise just face it and say ‘Allahu akbar.’” (Narrated by Ahmad, 191; classed as qawiy by al-Albani in Risalat Manasik al-Hajj wa’l-`Umrah, p. 21) 
Then he should move towards the right, with the Ka’bah on his left, and when he reaches the Yemeni Corner  (al-Rukn al-Yamani, which is the third corner after the Black Stone) he should touch it, without kissing his hand or saying “Allahu akbar”. If he cannot touch it then he should move on, and not crowd around it. Between the Yemeni Corner and the Black Stone he should say, “Rabbana atina fi’l-dunya hasanah wa fi’l-akhirah hasanah wa qinna ‘adhab al-Nar (Our Lord! Give us in this world that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good, and save us from the torment of the Fire).” Narrated by Abu Dawud and classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 1666. 
Every time he passes the Black Stone he should face it and say ‘Allahu akbar’, and in the rest of his tawaf he should recite whatever he likes of dhikr, du`a and Quran, because tawaf around the Ka’bah has been established for the remembrance of Allah.

In tawaf men should do two things: 


Uncover the right shoulder (idtiba`) from the beginning of tawaf until the end. This is done by placing the middle of the rida (upper garment) beneath the right armpit and the ends of the rida over the left shoulder. When the pilgrim finishes tawaf, he should put his rida back as it was before tawaf, because the time for wearing it with one shoulder uncovered is only in tawaf. 
Raml in the first three circuits only. Raml means walking quickly with short steps. In the last four circuits there is no raml, rather the pilgrim should walk normally. 

When the pilgrim has completed seven circuits of tawaf, he should cover his right shoulder and then go to the Station of Ibrahim (Maqam Ibrahim) and recite the words (interpretation of the meaning):
 “And take you (people) the Maqam (place) of Ibrahim (Abraham) [or the stone on which Ibrahim (Abraham) stood while he was building the Ka‘bah] as a place of prayer (for some of your prayers, e.g. two Rak‘at after the tawaf of the Ka‘bah at Makkah),” [Al-Baqarah 2:125]
Then he should pray two rak’ahs behind the Station; in the first rak’ah after reciting al-Fatihah he should recite Ya ayyaha’l-kafirun (Surat al-Kafirun 109) and in the second Qul Huwa Allahu ahad (Surat al-Ikhlas 112). Then when he has finished this prayer he should go to the Black Stone and touch it if he can. It is prescribed at this point to touch it only; if he cannot do that then he should go away and not point to it. 
Sa`i
Then he should go out to the Mas’a (place for sa`i ) and when he comes near to al-Safa he should recite (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, As-Safa and Al-Marwah (two mountains in Makkah) are of the Symbols of Allah.” [Al-Baqarah 2:158]
And he should say: “Nabda-u bima bada-a Allah bihi (We start with that with which Allah started).” 
Then he should climb al-Safa until he can see the Ka`bah, then he should face it and raise his hands and praise Allah, and make du`a as he wishes. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say: “La ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu la sharika lah, lahu’l-mulk, wa lahu’l-hamd, wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay-in qadir. La ilaha ill-Allah wahdah, anjaza wa’dah, wa nasara ‘abdah, wa hazama al-ahzaba wahdah (There is no god but Allah Alone, with no partner or associate; His is the Dominion, all praise is due to Him, and He is able to do all things. There is no god but Allah Alone; he fulfilled His promise, granted victory to His slave, and defeated the confederates alone).” (Narrated by Muslim, 1218) 
He should repeat that three times, and make du`a in between. He should recite this dhikr then make du`a, then recite it again and make du`a, and recite it a third time, then come down to al-Marwah, and not make du`a after the third time.
 When he reaches the green marker he should run as quickly as he can without disturbing anyone, because it was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did sa`i between al-Safa and al-Marwah, and he said, “The river bed is not crossed except with vigour.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah and classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, 2419)  The river bed [it was a dried river bed in the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] is the area between the two green markers that stand there now.
 When he reaches the second green marker, he should walk normally until he reaches al-Marwah. He should climb up it and turn to face the qiblah, and raise his hands and say what he said at al-Safa. Then he should come down from al-Marwah and head for al-Safa, walking in the place of walking and running in the place of running. When he reaches al-Safa he should do what he did the first time, and the same when he goes back to al-Marwah, until he has completed seven circuits; going from al-Safa to al-Marwah is one circuit, and coming back from al-Marwah to al-Safa is another circuit. During his sa`i he can say whatever he likes or dhikr and du`a, and recite Quran.
Note: The verse (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, As-Safa and Al-Marwah (two mountains in Makkah) are of the Symbols of Allah” [Al-Baqarah 2:158] should be recited by the pilgrim who wants to perform sa`i when he approaches al-Safa at the beginning of sa`i only. It is not mustahabb to repeat it every time he approaches al-Safa and al-Marwah, as some people do.
Shaving the head or cutting the hair
When he has completed seven circuits (of sa`i) he should shave his head if he is a man, or cut some of his hair . If he shaves his head he must shave his entire head, and if he cuts his hair he must cut from all over his head. Shaving is better than cutting because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made du`a three times for those who shaved their heads and once for those who cut their hair. (Narrated by Muslim, 1303)
 Women should cut the length of a fingertip from their hair.
 With these actions, `Umrah is complete. So `Umrah consists of ihram, tawaf, sa`i and shaving the head or cutting the hair.
We ask Allah to help us to do righteous deeds, and to accept them from us, for He is Ever Near and responds to our prayers.

It was not proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or his companions spoke the intention for any act of worship out loud. 
The Talbiyah in Hajj and ‘Umrah is not the intention. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Speaking the intention is a bid’ah (innovation) and doing so loudly is even more sinful. Rather the Sunnah is to make one's intention in the heart, because Allaah knows that which is secret and what is even more hidden. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say: Will you inform Allaah of your religion while Allaah knows all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth?”
[al-Hujuraat 49:16]
It was not narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or the Sahaabah or any of the most prominent imams that they spoke the intention out loud. From this we may understand that it is not prescribed, rather it is an innovation that has been introduced into the religion. And Allaah is the Source of strength. 
Fataawa Islamiyyah, 2/315 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
It was not narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) spoke the intention out loud, whether for prayer, wudoo’, fasting or any other act of worship. Even in Hajj and ‘Umrah he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not say, when he wanted to do Hajj and ‘Umrah, “O Allaah, I intend to do so and so.” It is not narrated that he did that or that he told any of his companions to do that. The most that has been narrated concerning that is that Dubaa’ah bint al-Zubayr (may Allaah be pleased with her) asked him for advice, saying that she wanted to do Hajj but she was feeling unwell. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to her: “Do Hajj and put a condition saying, ‘I will exit ihraam at the place where You cause me to fall ill,’ because your condition is valid before Allaah.’” In this case it is acceptable to speak out loud because resolving to do Hajj is like a vow, and a vow is spoken out loud, because if a person intends to make a vow in his heart, that is not a vow and is not counted as a vow. Because Hajj is like a vow and must be completed once started, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded Dubaa’ah to say her condition out loud and say, “If something prevents me from completing my Hajj, then the place of my exiting ihraam is the place where You cause me to be unable to proceed further.”  
With regard to what is proven in the hadeeth, that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Jibreel came to me and said, ‘Pray in this blessed valley, and say, ‘Umrah fi Hijjah or ‘Umrah wa Hijjah [‘Umrah and Hajj],’” that does not mean that he was speaking the intention out loud, rather what it means is that he was mentioning the acts of worship in his Talbiyah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not speak his intention out loud.

References","Praise be to Allah.Hajj is one of the best acts of worship. It is one of the pillars of Islam with which Allah sent Muhammad and without which a person’s religious commitment is incomplete. 
Conditions of accepting acts of worship
Worship cannot bring a person closer to Allah and cannot be accepted unless it meets two conditions : 

Sincerity towards Allah Alone, i.e., it is done to seek the Countenance of Allah and the Hereafter, and is not done to show off, to enhance one’s reputation or for worldly gain. 
Following the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in word and deed. Following the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) can only be achieved by knowing his Sunnah. 

Hence the one who wants to worship Allah by doing any act of worship – Hajj or anything else – has to learn the teachings of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning it, so that his actions will be in accordance with the Sunnah. 
We will sum up in these few lines the description of Hajj as narrated in the Sunnah. 
In the answer to question no. 31819  we have already described ‘Umrah – please refer to that question also. 
Types of Hajj 
There are three types of Hajj: Tamattu’, Ifrad and Qiran. 

Tamattu’ means entering ihram for ‘Umrah only during the months of Hajj (the months of Hajj are Shawwal, Dhu’l-Qi’dah and Dhu’l-Hijjah; see al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 7/62). When the pilgrim reaches Makkah he performs tawaf and sa’i for ‘Umrah, and shaves his head or cuts his hair, and exits ihram. Then when the day of al-Tarwiyah, which is the 8th of Dhu’l-Hijjah, comes, he enters ihram for Hajj only, and does all the actions of Hajj. So Tamattu’ involves a complete ‘Umrah and a complete Hajj.
Ifrad means entering ihram for Hajj only. When the pilgrim reaches Makkah he performs tawaf al-qudum (tawaf of arrival) and sa’i for Hajj, but he does not shave or cut his hair and does not exit ihram, rather he remains in ihram until he exits ihram after stoning Jamrat al-‘Aqabah on the day of ‘Eid.  If he delays the sa’i of Hajj until after the tawaf of Hajj, there is nothing wrong with that. 
Qiran means entering ihram for ‘Umrah and Hajj both together. Or entering ihram for ‘Umrah first then including Hajj in that before starting the tawaf of Hajj. That is done by intending that his tawaf and sa’i will be for both Hajj and ‘Umrah.  

The actions done in Qiran are the same as those done in Ifrad, except that the pilgrim doing Qiran has to offer a hadiy (sacrifice) whereas the pilgrim doing Ifrad does not. 
The best type of hajj
The best of these three types of Hajj is Tamattu’. This is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined upon his Companions and urged them to do. 
Even if a person enters ihram for Qiran or Ifrad, then it is strongly recommended for him to change his intention to ‘Umrah, then complete ‘Umrah and exit ihram, so that he will then be doing Tamattu’. He may do that after doing tawaf al-qudum and sa’i  – because when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did tawaf and sa’i during his Farewell Pilgrimage, and his Companions were with him, he told everyone who did not have a sacrificial animal (hadiy) to change his intention and make his ihram for ‘Umrah and to cut his hair and exit ihram, and he said, “Were it not that I have brought the hadiy with me, I would do what I have commanded you to do.” 
Ihram 
The pilgrim should observe the Sunnahs of ihram which are mentioned in the question referred to above, namely doing ghusl, applying perfume and praying. Then he should enter ihram after he finishes the prayer or after boarding his means of transportation. 
Then if he is doing Tamattu’, he should say, “Labbayk Allahumma bi ‘Umrah (Here I am, O Allah, for ‘Umrah).” 
If he is doing Qiran, he should say, “Labbayk Allahumma bi Hajjah wa ‘Umrah (Here I am, O Allah, for Hajj and ‘Umrah).” 
If he is doing Ifrad, he should say, “Labbayk Allahumma Hajjan (Here I am, O Allah, for Hajj).” 
Then he should say, “Allaahumma hadhihi hijjah la riya-a fiha wa la sum’ah (O Allah, this is a pilgrimage in which there is no showing off or seeking reputation).”  
Reciting the Talbiyah
Then he should recite the Talbiyah as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did: “Labbayka Allahumma labbayk, labbayka la sharika laka labbayk. Inna al-hamd wa’l-ni’mata laka wa’l-mulk, la sharika lak  (Here I am, O Allah, here I am. Here I am, You have no partner, here I am. Verily all praise and blessings are Yours, and all sovereignty, You have no partner).” 
The Talbiyah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also included the words, “Labbayka ilah al-haqq (Here I am, O God of Truth).” 
Ibn ‘Umar used to add to the Talbiyah the words, “Labbayk wa sa’dayka, wa’l-khayru bi yadayka, wa’l-raghbau ilayka wa’l-amal (Here I am and blessed by You, and all good is in Your hands, and desire and action are directed towards You).” 
Men should raise their voices when saying this, but a woman should recite in such a manner that those who are beside her can hear it, unless there is a man beside her who is not one of her mahrams, in which case she should recite it silently. 
If the person who is entering ihram fears some obstacle that may prevent him from completing his pilgrimage (such as sickness, an enemy, being stopped from proceeding any further, etc), then he should stipulate a condition when entering ihram by saying, “If I am prevented then my exiting ihram is where I am prevented” – i.e., if something prevents me from completing my pilgrimage such as sickness or delay etc, then I will exit my ihram. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded Duba’ah bint al-Zubayr, when she wanted to enter ihram but she was sick, to stipulate such a condition, and he said, “Your condition is valid with your Lord.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (5089) and Muslim (1207). 
If he stipulates this condition and something happens to prevent him from completing his pilgrimage, then he exits his ihram and does not have to do anything (i.e., offer a sacrifice in compensation). 
But the one who does not fear that some obstacle may prevent him from completing his pilgrimage does not have to stipulate any conditions, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not stipulate conditions nor did he command everyone to do so. Rather he told Duba’ah bint al-Zubayr to do that because she was sick. 
The muhrim (person who has entered ihram) should recite the Talbiyah a great deal, especially when circumstances and times change, such as when going up to a high place or going down to a low place, or when night or day begin. After that he should ask Allah for His good pleasure and for Paradise, and seek refuge in His Mercy from the Fire. 
The Talbiyah is prescribed in ‘Umrah from the moment one enters ihram until one starts Tawaf. In Hajj it is prescribed from the moment one enters ihram until one stones Jamrat al-‘Aqabah on the day of ‘Eid. 
Ghusl when entering Makkah 
When the pilgrim approaches Makkah, he should do ghusl before entering, if possible, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did ghusl before entering Makkah. (Narrated by Muslim, 1259)
Then when he enters al-Masjid al-Haram he should do so with his right foot first, and say, “Bismillah wa’l-salatu wa’l-salam ‘ala Rasul-Allah. Allahumma ighfir li dhunubi waftah li abwab rahmatika. A’udhu Billah il-‘Azim wa bi wajhih il-karim wa bi sultanih il-‘qadim min al-Shaytan il-rajim (In the name of Allah, and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allah. O Allah, forgive me my sins and open to me the gates of Your mercy. I seek refuge with Allah the Almighty and in His noble Countenance and His eternal power from the accursed Satan).” 
Performing Tawaf
Then he should go to the Black Stone in order to start tawaf … The description of Tawaf is given in Question no. 31819 . 
Performing sa`i
Then after he has done tawaf and prayed two rak’ahs, he should go to the Mas’a (place for doing sa’i) and perform sa’i between al-Safa and al-Marwah. The description of sa’i is given in question no. 31819 . 
The pilgrim who is doing Tamattu’ should do sa’i for ‘Umrah; those who are doing Ifrad and Qiran should do sa’i for Hajj, and they may delay it until after Tawaf al-Ifadah. 
Shaving the head or cutting the hair 
When the pilgrim who is doing Tamattu’ has completed seven circuits of sa’i, he should shave his head if he is a man, or cut his hair . If he shaves his head he must shave his entire head, and if he cuts his hair he must cut from all over his head. Shaving is better than cutting because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made du’a three times for those who shaved their heads and once for those who cut their hair. (Narrated by Muslim, 1303)
But if the time of Hajj is so close that there will be no time for the hair to grow back, then it is better to cut one’s hair at this point, so that there will be some hair left to shave during Hajj. The evidence for that is the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded his Companions, during the Farewell Pilgrimage, to cut their hair during ‘Umrah, because they arrived on the morning of the 4th of Dhu’l-Hijjah. 
Women should cut the length of a fingertip from their hair. 
With these actions, the ‘Umrah of the one who is doing Tamattu’ is concluded, after which he should exit ihram completely and do everything that those who are not in ihram do, such as wearing regular clothes, wearing perfume, having intercourse with their wives, etc. 
Those who are doing Ifrad or Qiran should not shave their heads or cut their hair, or exit ihram, rather they should remain in ihram until they exit ihram on the day of ‘Eid, after stoning Jamrat al-‘Aqabah and shaving their heads or cutting their hair. 
Then when the day of al-Tarwiyah comes, which is the 8th day of Dhu’l-Hijjah, the one who is doing Tamattu’ should enter ihram for Hajj in the morning from the place where he is in Makkah. It is mustahabb for him to do the same when entering ihram for Hajj as he did when entering ihram for ‘Umrah, namely doing ghusl, putting on perfume and praying. He should form the intention of entering ihram for Hajj and recite the Talbiyah, and say, “Labbayk Allahumma Hajjan (Here I am, O Allah, for Hajj).” 
If he fears some obstacle that may prevent him from completing his Hajj, he should stipulate a condition by saying, “If I am prevented then my exiting ihram is where I am prevented.” If he does not fear any such obstacle then he should not make any such condition. It is mustahabb to recite the Talbiyah out loud until he starts to stone Jamrat al-‘Aqabah on the day of ‘Eid. 
Going to Mina 
Then the pilgrim should go out to Mina and pray Zuhr, ‘Asr, Maghrib, ‘Isha and Fajr there, shortening the prayers but not joining them, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to shorten his prayers in Mina but he did not join them. Shortening the prayers means making the four-rak’ah prayers two rak’ahs. The people of Makkah and others should shorten their prayers in Mina, ‘Arafah and Muzdalifah because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to lead the people in prayer during the Farewell Pilgrimage and there were people from Makkah with him, but he did not tell them to offer their prayers in full. If it had been obligatory for them to do so, he would have told them to do so as he did on the day of the Conquest of Makkah. But since the city has spread and incorporated Mina so that it is like one of the quarters of Makkah, then the people of Makkah should not shorten their prayers there.  
Going to ‘Arafah 
When the sun rises on the day of ‘Arafah , the pilgrim travels from Mina to ‘Arafah and stops in Namirah until the time of Zuhr (Namirah is a place just before ‘Arafah), if he can do so. If he cannot do it, it does not matter because staying in Namirah is Sunnah but it is not obligatory. When the sun passes its zenith (i.e., when the time for Zuhr prayer begins), he should pray Zuhr and ‘Asr, two rak’ahs each, and join them together at the time of Zuhr, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did, so as to leave a lot of time for standing and making du’a. 
Then after the prayer he should devote his time to making dhikr and du’a and beseeching Allah, and praying as he likes, raising his hands and facing the qiblah even if the mountain of ‘Arafah is behind him, because the Sunnah is to face the qiblah, not the mountain. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood by the mountain and said, “I am standing here, but all of ‘Arafah is the place of standing.” 
Most of the Prophet’s du’a in that great place of standing was: “La ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu la sharika lah, lahu’l-mulk, wa lahu’l-hamd, wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadir (There is no god but Allah Alone, with no partner or associate; His is the Dominion, all praise is due to Him, and He is able to do all things).” 
If the pilgrim gets tired and wants to have a break by talking to his companions about useful things or by reading from some useful books, especially things that have to do with the generosity and great bounty of Allah, in order to increase his hopes on that day, this is good.  Then he can go back to beseeching Allah and praying to Him. He should strive to make the most of the end of the day by making du’a. The best of du’a is du’a made on the day of ‘Arafah. 
Going to Muzdalifah 
When the sun sets, the pilgrim should go to Muzdalifah . When he reaches there, he should pray Maghrib and ‘Isha with one adhan and two iqamahs. If he fears that he will not reach Muzdalifah before midnight, he should pray on the way, because it is not permissible to delay ‘Isha prayer until after midnight. 
He should stay overnight in Muzdalifah, then when dawn comes he should pray Fajr early, with the adhan and iqamah, and then head for al-Mash’ar al-Haram (which is the site of the mosque in Muzdalifah) and proclaim the oneness and greatness of Allah (by saying La ilaha ill-Allah and Allahu akbar), and making du’a as he likes, until it has become very light (i.e., when the light of day appears before the sun has actually risen). If it is not easy for him to go to al-Mash’ar al-Haram, he should make du’a where he is, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood there and all of Muzdalifah is the place of standing. When he is reciting dhikr and making du’a he should face the qiblah and raise his hands. 
Going back to Mina 
When it has become very light, before the sun rises, he should go to Mina and hasten through Wadi Mahsar (which is a valley between Muzdalifah and Mina). When he reaches Mina he should stone Jamrat al-‘Aqabah, which is the last one that is closest to Makkah, throwing seven pebbles one after another, each of which should be approximately the size of a fava bean, saying “Allahu akbar” with each throw. (The Sunnah when stoning Jamrat al-‘Aqabah is to face the Jamarah with Makkah to one's left and Mina to one’s right). When he has finished this stoning, he should slaughter his sacrificial animal, then shave his head or cut his hair if he is male; women should cut the length of a fingertip from their hair. This is the first stage of exiting ihram, in which it becomes permissible to do everything except have intercourse with one's wife. Then the pilgrim should go back to Makkah and do tawaf and sa’i for Hajj. Then comes the second stage of exiting ihram, after which everything becomes permissible which was forbidden whilst in ihram. 
The Sunnah is to put on perfume when one wants to go to Makkah to do tawaf after stoning the jamarat and shaving one’s head, because ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “I used to apply perfume to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) before he entered ihram and when he exited ihram, before he circumambulated the House.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1539; Muslim, 1189. 
Stoning the jamarat
Then after tawaf and sa’i, he should go back to Mina and stay there for two nights, the 11th and 12th of Dhu’l-Hijjah, and stone the three jamarat during those two days, when the sun has passed its zenith. It is better for him to go to the jamarat walking, but if he rides that is acceptable. He should stone the first jamrah, which is the one that is furthest away from Makkah and next to Masjid al-Khif, with seven pebbles, one after another, and say “Allahu akbar” after each throw. Then he should go forward a little and say a lengthy du’a, saying whatever he likes. If it is too difficult for him to stand for a long time and make du’a, he should say whatever is easy for him, even if it is only a little, so that he will have done the Sunnah. 
Then he should stone the middle jamrah with seven pebbles, one after another, saying “Allahu akbar” with every throw. Then he should move to his left and stand facing the qiblah, raising his hands, and offer a lengthy du’a if he can. Otherwise he should stand for as long as he can. He should not omit to stand and make du’a because it is Sunnah. Many people neglect that because of ignorance or because they take the matter lightly. The more the Sunnah is neglected the more important it becomes to do it and spread it among the people, lest it be abandoned and die out. 
Then he should stone Jamrat al-‘Aqabah with seven pebbles, one after another, saying “Allahu akbar” with each throw, then he should go away and not offer a du’a after that. 
When he has completed the stoning of the Jamarat on the 12th day of Dhu’l-Hijjah, if he wants he may hasten and leave Mina, and if he wants he may delay his departure and stay there for another night, the night of the 13th, and stone the three Jamaraat after noon as he did before. It is better to delay, but it is not obligatory unless the sun has set on the 12th and he is still in Mina, in which case it is obligatory to stay until one has stoned the three Jamarat after noon on the following day. But if the sun sets on the 12th and he is still in Mina but not by choice, such as if he had already started out and boarded his means of transportation, but got delayed because of crowded conditions and traffic jams etc., then he is not obliged to stay there, because the delay until sunset was not by his choice.
 Farewell tawaf 
When the pilgrim wants to leave Makkah and go back to his country, he should not leave until he has performed the farewell tawaf (tawaf al-wada’), because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one should leave until the last thing that he does is (tawaf) around the House.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1327)
According to another version, he told the people that the last thing they should do was (tawaf) around the house, but he made an exception for women who were menstruating. Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1755; Muslim, 1328. 
Women who are menstruating or bleeding following childbirth do not have to do the farewell tawaf; neither should they stand by the door of al-Masjid al-Haram to bid farewell, because that was not narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
The last thing the pilgrim should do when he wants to leave is to circumambulate the House. If after the farewell tawaf he stays and waits for his companions or to load his luggage or to buy something he needs on the way, there is nothing wrong with that, and he does not have to repeat the tawaf, unless he intends to delay his journey, such as if he intended to travel at the beginning of the day and he did the farewell tawaf, then he delays his travelling until the end of the day, for example; in this case he has to repeat the tawaf so that it will be the last thing he does in Makkah. 
Things to consider when entering ihram
The pilgrim who enters ihram for Hajj or ‘Umrah has to do the following: 

He has to adhere to that which Allah has enjoined of religious laws, such as praying on time in congregation.
He has to avoid all that Allah has forbidden of obscene and immoral speech and sin, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
	“So whosoever intends to perform Hajj therein (by assuming Ihram), then he should not have sexual relations (with his wife), nor commit sin, nor dispute unjustly during the Hajj.” [al-Baqarah 2:197]
He should avoid annoying the Muslims with his words or actions, at the holy sites and elsewhere.
He should avoid all things that are forbidden when in ihram :


So he should not cut anything from his hair or nails, but removing thorns and the like is fine, even if that results in some bleeding.
He should not apply perfume after entering ihram, either to his body, his clothes, his food or his drink. He should not wash with perfumed soap either. But if any traces of perfume remain from that which he put on before entering ihram, that does not matter.
He should not hunt.
He should not have intercourse with his wife.
He should not touch her with desire or kiss her etc.
He should not enter into a marriage contract for himself or arrange a marriage for anyone else, or propose marriage to a woman for himself or on behalf of another.
He should not wear gloves, but wrapping one’s hands with a piece of cloth does not matter.

These seven prohibitions apply equally to men and women. 
Things forbidden to men in ihram
The following apply only to men: 

Men should not cover their heads with something that stays on the head. Shading their heads with umbrellas, car roofs and tents, and carrying mats etc. (on one’s head, when moving them from one place to another), is acceptable.
They should not wear shirts, turbans, burnouses, pants or leather slippers, unless someone cannot find an izar (waist wrapper), in which case he may wear pants; and if he cannot find sandals he may wear shoes.
They should not wear anything that is akin to the above, such as abayas, cloaks, hats, t-shirts and the like.
It is permissible for men to wear sandals, rings, eyeglasses and hearing aids, and to wear wristwatches, or to put watches on strings around their necks, and to wear money belts.
It is permissible for them to wash with unperfumed soaps, and to scratch their heads and bodies, and if any hairs fall unintentionally as a result, there is no sin on them.

Things forbidden to women in ihram
Women should not wear niqab , which is what they use to cover their faces, with holes cut for the eyes. They should not wear the burqa’ either. 
The Sunnah is for them to uncover their faces unless non-mahram men can see them, in which case they should cover their faces whilst in ihram and at other times.

These are the words of Sheikh AHMED, the WATCHMAN of the Prophet MOHAMMED's MOSQUE(PBUH). 

On Friday night after reciting the HOLY QURAN, SHEIK AHMED slept and saw the HOLY Prophet(PBUH) in his dream. 

The Prophet (PBUH) said to him "" Sheik Ahmed, this Friday about six thousand (6,000) people Died but none of them went to heaven. 

The women do not follow what their husbands tell them anymore. 

The believers who have money do not help the poor. people do not perform their pilgrimage as it has been prescribed. The Muslims do not say their prayers regularly, let alone how it is supposed to be. Sheik Ahmed, tell the Muslims that this letter comes from you. They are to produce more copies of this letter and give to other Muslims so that it can be spread and get to all the Muslims in this world. 

Anyone who produces this and spreads it to other Muslims will see it indeed (Will see the REWARD). The Prophet (PBUH) will count a person to Paradise along with his children. The Muslims who receives this letter and refuses to disperse it among other Muslims will not see benediction (INSHALLAH). 

Those who are indebted must write. Allah in his ! infinite mercies will send help to pay his debt."" 

I, Sheik AHMED, if what I said is a lie, may be Prophet Mohammed (PBUH) not send his divine benediction to me. Dear Muslim brothers and sisters, 
you must follow the religion the way Prophet (PBUH) honored it, like the divine revelation it is. Ask for forgiveness, fast every Monday. 

Produce 20 copies of this letter and spread it to all Muslims Anyone who does the until all Muslims get a copy, will INSHALLAH, see the opening of  the Prophet (PBUH) success will follow. He will see the things he had never seen before. This is not a letter to be kept. It must be dispersed in quantities. 

A man called Klavern, got this letter and gave it to his secretary to produce 20 copies and dispersed them. After some days, he saw more doors of opportunities opening up for him. 

Another person named Abdul-Salam got it and forgot it in the drawer of his office and after a certain time he lost his job. He later remembered the letter and went and produced 20 copies which were distributed and within (5) days he got employed and is in a higher position than what he had before. 

Another man called Balemanthan received it and he thought it was 
something useless and treated it without respect or courtesy. 

He tore the letter and within none (9) days he died. 

I am appealing to anyone who comes across this letter to kindly circulate it in large volume. 

HANKS.. MAY ALLAH BLESS YOU."".",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: 
We have heard of this false letter many times 
    for many years; it spreads among the people from time to time and has become widespread among the common folk. Its wording varies, but the writer 
    says that he has seen the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in a dream and he gave him this message to pass on… This 
    fabricator makes many claims in his letter that are obvious lies and blatantly false. I have drawn attention to it in the past, and have explained 
    to people that it is obviously false. When I looked at this latest version I hesitated to write about it, because it is obviously false and 
    because the fabricator has the great audacity to tell such lies. I did not think that its falseness would trick anyone who has the least insight 
    or common sense. 
But many brothers have told me that this 
    letter has deceived many people, and they have circulated it amongst themselves, and some of them have believed it. Because of that I thought that 
    people like me should write about it, so as explain that it is false and that it is a fabrication against the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), so that no one will be deceived by it. Anyone with knowledge and faith, or a sound nature and common sense who 
    studies this letter will realize that it is a lie and a fabrication in many ways. 
I asked one of the relatives of Shaykh Ahmad 
    to whom this lie is attributed about this letter, and he told me that it is falsely attributed to Shaykh Ahmad, and he never said this at all. The 
    Shaykh Ahmad mentioned here died a while ago. Even if we assume that this Shaykh Ahmad or someone greater than him claimed to have seen the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in a dream or whilst awake, and he gave him this advice, we would know for certain that 
    he was lying, or that the one who said that to him was the Shaytaan, and not the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), for 
    many reasons, including the following: 
The Messenger  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) would not say anything but that which is the truth, either during his life or after his death. This letter clearly goes 
    against his sharee’ah in many ways – as we shall see below. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) may be seen in a dream, 
    and the one who sees him in his true form has indeed seen him, because the Shaytaan cannot appear in his form, as it says in the saheeh hadeeth. 
    But it all depends on the faith, sincerity, good character, accuracy, religious commitment and trustworthiness of the one who claims to have seen 
    him, and whether he saw the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in his true form or in some other form. If there is a hadeeth 
    that was narrated from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) who supposedly said it during his lifetime, but it is not 
    transmitted by trustworthy men of good character, it cannot be accepted or used as evidence; or it is transmitted by trustworthy and accurate 
    narrators, but it goes against a report narrated by stronger narrators and cannot possibly be reconciled with that more accurate and more 
    trustworthy report, then one of them is abrogated and cannot be followed, and the second one abrogates it and is to be followed wherever possible 
    and when its conditions are met. If that is not possible and they cannot be reconciled, then the report which is less reliable should be rejected. 
    The ruling in this case is that it is odd (shaadhdh) and should not be followed. So how about a letter whose author, who supposedly narrated it 
    from the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), is unknown and it is not known whether he is trustworthy or not? In 
    this case it should be rejected and no attention should be paid to it, even if it contains nothing that goes against sharee’ah, so how about if 
    the letter contains many things that indicate that it is false and that it is falsely attributed to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), and it includes rulings [?] that Allaah has not permitted? The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “Whoever attributes words to me that I did not say, let him take his place in Hell.” End quote. 
Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan wrote an article 
    about this letter, warning against it, which was published in al-Da’wah magazine, issue no. 1082, in which he said: 
This fabricated letter is old. It appeared in Egypt more than eighty years ago, and the 
    scholars refuted it and ruled it to be false, and they pointed out the lies and falsehoods it contains. One of the scholars was Shaykh Muhammad 
    Rasheed Rida, who said in his refutation of this letter: 
We answered this question in 1322 AH, and we 
    remember that we have seen something like this letter many times from when we were learning how to read and write until now. All of them are 
    attributed to a man called Shaykh Ahmad, the Watchman of the Prophet’s Tomb. The letter is definitely false, and no one who has had the faintest 
    whiff of knowledge and religion would dispute that. Rather it is only the simple-minded among the illiterate masses who believe it. 
Then he refuted it at length, refuting each 
    fabrication contained in the letter. Moreover this letter has been warmly accepted by some of the ignorant, and they started to print it and 
    distribute it, because they were influenced by the promises and warnings contained therein, because this immoral person who composed it said that 
    whoever makes x number of copies and distributes it will get what he wants, and if he is a sinner Allaah will forgive him, and if he is employed 
    he will be promoted, and if he is in debt his debt will be paid off, and whoever disbelieves it will be humiliated and such and such bad 
    consequences will come to him. When some of the ignorant read this, they are affected by it and they go ahead and distribute it out of fear and 
    greed. 
The scholars have stated that this letter is 
    false and they have warned people against distributing it and believing in it. These scholars include Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, who refuted 
    it in an excellent article and pointed out the lies and deception that it contains. This letter is false for a number of reasons: 
Firstly: 
the rulings of Islam, the promises and 
    warnings, and information about what the future holds are all matters that can only be proven through revelation from Allaah to His Messenger. 
    Revelation came to an end when the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died, after Allaah had perfected the religion 
    through him. We have inherited the Qur’aan and Sunnah which are sufficient to guide us. As for dreams and visions, they do not prove anything, 
    because most of them are the fabrications of the devils, aimed at leading people astray from their religion. The fabricators of this letter 
    promise those who believe in it that they will enter Paradise and that their needs will be met and they will be relieved of distress, and they 
    warn those who disbelieve in it that they will go to Hell and be humiliated. This is prescribing a new religion and telling lies against Allaah – 
    we seek refuge with Allaah from that. 
Secondly: 
The fabricator of this letter makes it 
    greater than the Qur’aan, because one who copies the Qur’aan and sends it from one country to another will not get the reward which this liar says 
    the one who distributes this letter will get; and the one who does not copy the Qur’aan and send it from one country to another will not be denied 
    the intercession of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) if he is a believer – so how can the believer be denied 
    intercession if he does not copy this letter and send it from one country to another as this fabricator says? 
Thirdly:
This letter makes a claim to have knowledge 
    of the unseen, as it says in it: “this Friday about six thousand (6,000) people Died but none of them went to heaven”. This is a claim to have 
    knowledge of the unseen which no one knows except Allaah, for He is the One Who knows how many people die in Islam and how many die in kufr. 
    Whoever claims to have knowledge of the unseen is a kaafir who disbelieves in Allaah. 
Fourthly:
Reward and punishment in this world and in 
    the Hereafter can only be proven by a text from the Book of Allaah or the Sunnah of His Messenger. This fabricator says that those who believe in 
    this letter will be rewarded and those who disbelieve in it and do not distribute it will be punished. Allaah has proven it to be a lie – praise 
    be to Allaah – because many Muslims have disbelieved in it and believed it to be a forgery, and nothing but good has happened to them, whilst 
    those who believed in it and distributed it have been met with nothing but disappointment and loss. 
Moreover this fabricator wants to make the 
    masses and the ignorant believe in this letter, so he swears an oath by Allaah repeatedly, that he is sincere and that his letter is true, and 
    that if he is lying, may he exit this world following a religion other than Islam. He wants to make a show of loving Islam and hating sin and 
    evil, so that people will think well of him and believe him. 
This is part of his evil scheming, and indeed 
    of his stupidity and ignorance. Swearing and making repeated oaths does not indicate that everyone who does so is sincere. Many liars swear oaths 
    in order to deceive the people. Iblees swore to our parents [Adam and Hawwa – peace be upon them],  
“Verily, I am one of the sincere 
    well-wishers for you both” 
[ al-A’raaf 7:21 – interpretation of the 
    meaning]. 
And Allaah said to His Prophet 
    (interpretation of the meaning):  
“And (O Muhammad) obey you not everyone 
    Hallaaf Maheen (the one who swears much and is a liar or is worthless)” 
[al-Qalam 68:10]. 
    
Allaah tells us that the hypocrites swear 
    when telling lies, and they do that knowingly, as He says of them (interpretation of the meaning): 
“they will indeed swear that their 
    intention is nothing but good. Allaah bears witness that they are certainly liars”
[al-Tawbah 9:107]
Does this ignorant fool think that if he 
    fabricates lies against Allaah and His Messenger in this letter and swears at the end of it, that the Muslims will believe him and accept his 
    words? No way! As for his making a show of feeling proud of Islam and being pained by evil deeds, this is a kind of statement which is aimed at 
    making people think well of him and accept what he says, but he does not realize that the accursed Pharaoh made a show of being sincere and kind 
    to his people when he said, preventing them from following Moosa (peace be upon him), 
“I fear that he may change your religion, 
    or that he may cause mischief to appear in the land”
[Ghaafir 40:26 – interpretation of the 
    meaning]
Not everyone who appears to be offering 
    advice and to be proud of Islam is sincere. The warnings against evil and sin that are narrated in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and their descriptions 
    of the resulting punishments are sufficient for those who have faith. 
Perhaps someone may ask, what is the goal of 
    the author of this letter? What is the motive that made him fabricate it and distribute it? 
The answer is that his goal is to mislead 
    people away from the Book of their Lord and the Sunnah of their Prophet, and towards myths and false stories. If they believe him in this and it 
    becomes widely accepted among them, then he will invent more and more for them, so that they will be distracted by that from the Qur’aan and 
    Sunnah, then it will be easy to introduce more false ideas to them and change their beliefs. For so long as the Muslims adhere to the Book of 
    their Lord and the Sunnah of their Prophet, those who seek to misguide them will never be able to divert them away from their religion, but if 
    they forsake the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and believe in myths and stories and devilish dreams, it will be easy for any misleader and heretic to lead 
    them astray. There may be secret kaafir organizations behind this, who are working to distribute these fabrications in order to lead the Muslims 
    astray from their religion. This is indicated by the fact that this myth has been around for a century, and it is unlikely that its inventor is 
    still alive. So if there were not someone working to distribute it after his death, it would not have appeared. So beware, O Muslims, of believing 
    in these fabrications. Do not distribute them amongst yourselves, and ask the scholars about anything that you do not understand. 
The enemies of Allaah and His Messenger among 
    the kaafirs, hypocrites and devils of the jinn and mankind are always trying to lead people astray from the true religion and make them follow 
    false religions; to lead them astray from the path that leads to Paradise and make them follow the path that leads to Hell, from following the 
    Messengers to following the devils and those who lead people astray. So they used to distort the laws of the Prophets and alter the Books that 
    were revealed to the Messengers, as they did with the Tawraat (Torah) and Injeel (Gospel). When Allaah sent the Seal of the Prophets – Muhammad 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) – and revealed to him the Holy Qur’aan and the straight path, He guaranteed to preserve the 
    Qur’aan and protect it from being changed and altered. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down 
    the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur’aan) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)”
[al-Hijr 15:9] 
“Falsehood cannot come to it from before 
    it or behind it, (it is) sent down by the All‑Wise, Worthy of all praise”
[Fussilat 41:42]
And He protected the Sunnah of His Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) from the lies of the liars by means of the keen efforts of the trustworthy scholars who preserved 
    it and transmitted it, and eliminated the fabrications of the liars who tried to interfere with it. So they set out guidelines and principles by 
    means of which the saheeh (sound) hadeeths could be distinguished from false hadeeths, and they compiled the saheeh hadeeths and protected them, 
    and they listed the false hadeeths and fought them and warned people against them. Because the enemies of Allaah and His Messenger were unable to 
    introduce false ideas into the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger, they resorted to attempting to divert the people away from the 
    Qur’aan and Sunnah and distract them with false stories and alleged dreams, filled with false promises and warnings which may tempt and deceive 
    those who are weak in faith and ignorant, and lead many of them into shirk and heresy and innovation in the name of religion, worship and 
    asceticism, following these myths. 
The way of these deviants is not based on the 
    Qur’aan and Sunnah, rather it is based on false stories and so-called dreams. So they go astray from true guidance and forsake the Book of Allaah 
    and the Sunnah of His Messenger, and pay heed to the whispers of the Shaytaan. This is the recompense of the one who turns away from the Qur’aan 
    and Sunnah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whosoever turns away blindly from the 
    remembrance of the Most Gracious (Allaah) (i.e. this Qur’aan and worship of Allaah), We appoint for him Shaytaan (Satan ‑ devil) to be a Qareen (a 
    companion) to him.
And verily, they (Satans / devils) hinder them from the path (of Allaah), but they think that 
    they are guided aright!”
[al-Zukhruf 43:36]
So fear Allaah, O slaves of Allaah, and 
    adhere to the Book of your Lord and the Sunnah of your Prophet, and beware of false ideas propagated by the enemies of Islam. 
May Allaah help us all to adhere to the 
    Qur’aan and Sunnah. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon His family and companions.",Islam Q&A
31865,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/31865,Were the Heavens and Earth Created in 6 or 8 Days?,"I read the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Indeed, your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days, and then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty). He brings the night as a cover over the day, seeking it rapidly, and (He created) the sun, the moon, the stars subjected to His Command. Surely, His is the creation and commandment. Blessed is Allah, the Lord of the `Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists)!”
[Al-A’raf 7:54] 
What I understand from this is that Allah created the heavens and the earth in six days. This is clear. 
But in another passage Allah mentions the creation of the heavens and the earth, and He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): Do you verily disbelieve in Him Who created the earth in two Days? And you set up rivals (in worship) with Him? That is the Lord of the `Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists).
He placed therein (i.e. the earth) firm mountains from above it, and He blessed it, and measured therein its sustenance (for its dwellers) in four Days equal (i.e. all these four `days’ were equal in the length of time) for all those who ask (about its creation).
Then He rose over (Istawa) towards heaven when it was smoke, and said to it and to the earth: `Come both of you willingly or unwillingly.’ They both said: `We come willingly.’
Then He completed and finished from their creation (as) seven heavens in two Days and He made in each heaven its affair. And We adorned the nearest (lowest) heaven with lamps (stars) to be an adornment as well as to guard (from the devils by using them as missiles against the devils). Such is the Decree of Him, the All-Mighty, the All-Knower”
[Fussilat 41:9-12]
 Here Allah says that He created the earth in two days, then He placed therein firm mountains and measured therein its sustenance in four days, which makes six days in all. Then He created the heavens in two days, so the total comes to eight days.
How can we reconcile between the two verses?","The earth was created in two days, and the mountains were created and the sustenance were measured in two more days which makes a total of four. Then the creation of the seven heavens took two days making the total six days of the Days of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted.",,"Praise be to Allah.This is an issue which confuses some people, and some of them think that Allah created the heavens and the earth in eight days as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): Do you verily disbelieve in Him Who created the earth in two Days? And you set up rivals (in worship) with Him? That is the Lord of the `Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists).
He placed therein (i.e. the earth) firm mountains from above it, and He blessed it, and measured therein its sustenance (for its dwellers) in four Days equal (i.e. all these four `days’ were equal in the length of time) for all those who ask (about its creation).

Then He completed and finished from their creation (as) seven heavens in two Days and He made in each heaven its affair. And We adorned the nearest (lowest) heaven with lamps (stars) to be an adornment as well as to guard (from the devils by using them as missiles against the devils). Such is the Decree of Him, the All-Mighty, the All-Knower.” [Fussilat 41:9-12] because this seems to contradict the other verse which says that He created them in six days . 
This is a misunderstanding, and the answer to it is as follows: 
There is no contradiction between the time period mentioned in these verses and the other verse which says that it was six days. 
In these verses – from Surat Fussilat – we see that Allah is telling us that He “created the earth in two Days”.  
Then He “placed therein (i.e. the earth) firm mountains from above it, and He blessed it, and measured therein its sustenance (for its dwellers)” in four days equal– i.e., in two days that were added to the two days in which He created the earth, so the total is four days.  It does not say that the creation of the mountains and the measuring of the sustenance took four days. 
Perhaps the confusion which is mentioned in the question stems from this, i.e., from thinking that the four days are added to the two days in which the earth was created , equaling six, and then adding the two days in which the heavens were created (“Then He completed and finished from their creation (as) seven heavens in two Days ”) – making a total of eight days, not six days. But this confusion can be dispelled by dealing with this mistaken notion.  So the earth was created in two days, and the mountains were created and the sustenance measured in two more days which makes a total of four, i.e., this took the other two days. Then the creation of the seven heavens took two days. So the total is six days of the Days of Allah , may He be Glorified and Exalted. 
The commentators of the Quran commented on this fact which deals with the mistaken notion. Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“in four days” – this is like someone saying, “I set out from Basra to Baghdad in ten days and to Kufa in fifteen days, i.e., a total time of fifteen days.” (Al-Jami` li Ahkam Al-Quran, vol. 15, p. 343). 
Al-Baghawi said: “in four days” means the creation of what is in the earth. The measuring of the sustenance was on Tuesday and Wednesday, which along with Sunday and Monday add up to four days. This is like saying “I married a woman yesterday and today I married two” – one of whom is the woman whom he married the day before.” (Tafsir Al-Baghawi, 7/165) 
Al-Zajjaj (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “in four days” means two days added to the previous two days.” (Al-Kashshaf, vol. 3, p. 444) 
These verses – from Surat Fussilat – confirm the other verse, which says that the creation of the heavens and the earth was completed in six days. So there is no contradiction concerning the period in which Allah created the heavens and the earth. There cannot be any such contradictions in the Quran..

I want to act in accordance with that which Allaah has revealed and has enjoined. How can I do that, in sha Allaah? 

How can I find the rulings and commandments? 
, I read the Qur’aan and books of seerah and hadeeth. Is there anything that will help me to understand the rulings and prohibitions of Allaah etc. from the Qur’aan and Sunnah?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The commands and prohibitions of Allaah are 
    to be found in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The scholars have explained that 
    in their books, whether they are books of hadeeth or of fiqh. 
Some of the scholars have written books 
    dealing specifically with the verses of rulings (aayaat al-ahkaam); others have written books on the ahaadeeth of rulings (ahaadeeth al-ahkaam). 
    Then there are commentaries on these books and texts, such as Ahkaam al-Qur’aan by al-Jassaas; Nayl al-Awtaar Sharh Muntaqa al-Akhbaar;
    Subul al_Salaam Sharh Buloogh al-Maraam; Ihkaam al-Ahkaam Sharh ‘Umdat al-Ahkaam. 
The Muslim can find out the rulings, commands 
    and prohibitions of Allaah in two ways: 
1 – From trustworthy books 
You can refer to the following questions for 
    more information on the names of trustworthy books: 14082;
    20191. 
2 – From trustworthy scholars 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
There are two ways of acquiring knowledge: 
1 – Acquiring it from trustworthy books 
    written by scholars who are known for their knowledge, trustworthiness and sound beliefs, free from innovations and myths. 
2 – Acquiring it from a teacher who is 
    trustworthy in terms of his knowledge and religious commitment. This way is quicker and more reliable for knowledge, because in the first method a 
    seeker of knowledge may go astray without realizing, either because he misunderstands or because of a lack of knowledge, or for some other reason. 
    But if a seeker of knowledge combines both methods, that is better and more complete. The student should get his priorities straight, and brief 
    books on various subjects before studying books that deal with them in detail, so that he will move from one level to another, and he will not 
    move on to the next level until he has mastered the one that comes before it, so that his progress will be sound. 
Kitaab al-‘Ilm, 
    p. 64, 65 
With regard to acting upon what Allaah has 
    revealed, that cannot be done before knowing what Allaah has revealed, So the Muslim must seek knowledge, then when he knows, he must act upon 
    what he has learned. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
Abu ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sulami said: Those who 
    used to teach us the Qur’aan, ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Uthmaan and ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood and others, told us that when they learned ten verses from the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), they would not move on from that until they learned what was in them of knowledge and 
    put it into practice. They said, so we learned the Qur’aan and knowledge and practice all together. 
Al-Hasan al-Basri said that Allaah did not 
    reveal any verse but he wanted to learn concerning what it was revealed and what was meant by it. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Do they not then consider the Qur’aan 
    carefully?”
[al-Nisa’ 4:82]
Considering words is only of benefit if one 
    understands them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, We have made it a Qur’aan in 
    Arabic that you may be able to understand (its meanings and its admonitions)”
[al-Zukhruf 43:3]
The Messengers explained to the people that 
    which was revealed to them from their Lord, and they had to convey it clearly to mankind. What is required of the people is to understand what the 
    Messengers conveyed to them, and understanding implies knowledge and action. Whoever knows (the difference between) good and evil and does not 
    follow good and warn against evil, has not understood. Hence no one can be counted as being a man of understanding unless he does what will 
    benefit him and avoids what will harm him. So the insane person who cannot distinguish between the one and the other may fall into things that 
    will harm him and may run away from things that may benefit him. 
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 
    15/108 
Acting upon that which has been revealed from

31888,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/31888,The situation of the Muslims in Palestine,I was wondering wha you believe the fight taking place in the Holy Land is all about and what the end result might be.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly what is happening to the Muslims 
    in the Holy Land of hardship, torture, expulsion, killing and harm is a matter which causes sorrow to every Muslim, and indeed to every non-Muslim 
    who is reasonable, fair-minded and compassionate, when they see the blatant persecution inflicted upon innocent people, with the intention of 
    driving them out of their homes so that the enemy can take their place, which is an enemy that possesses the most advanced weapons, with which 
    they attack unarmed people who are deprived of the means of defending themselves. 
This Muslim people has endured for more than 
    fifty years, facing unending Zionist arrogance and aggression, which pays no heed to human dignity or any covenant or treaty, or any law, except 
    that to which their own whims and desires make them inclined and in which their evil rabbis and warlords encourage them. 
The outcome of that is well known to Muslims 
    as well as Jews, which is that the consequences will be in favour of the pious and the party of God will be the victors. The wrongdoer will never 
    enjoy security, stability and prosperity, rather he will be faced with fear, anxiety, grief and shame, until the day comes when the Muslims come 
    back to their religion and are governed by the sharee’ah of their Lord, then they will meet the Jews in battle, where the two sides will face one 
    another, and victory will go to the people of faith. 
Al-Bukhaari (2926) and Muslim (2922) narrated 
    from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Hour will not begin until the Muslims 
    fight the Jews and kill them, until a Jew will be hiding behind a rock or a tree, and the rock or tree will say, ‘O Muslim, O slave of Allaah, 
    here is a Jew behind me, come and kill him!’ except for the box-thorn (al-gharqad), for it is one of the trees of the Jews.” 
We ask Allaah to hasten the Muslims’ return 
    to their religion and to grant them the means of victory. May He grant us the joy of seeing His religion prevail and His enemies humiliated, and 
    may He raise the status of those who are persecuted, tortured or killed for His sake.

31897,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/31897,Raising the hands when making du’aa’ on Fridays,Is it mustahabb to raise the hands when saying Aameen to the du’aa’ of the khateeb on Friday?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The basic principle is that one should raise 
    the hands when making du’aa’, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah is Most Generous, and He dislikes 
    to turn away empty the hands of His slave when he raises them to Him.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3556; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh 
    al-Tirmidhi. 
It says in Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi: 
This hadeeth indicates that it is mustahabb 
    to raise the hands when making du’aa’. There are many ahaadeeth concerning that. 
But it was narrated 
    with regard to the khateeb on Fridays that when he makes du’aa’ on the minbar, he should point with his forefinger only and not raise his hands. 
    Indeed some of the Sahaabah denounced the khateeb who raises his hands in du’aa’. 
Muslim (874) and Abu Dawood (1104) narrated 
    that ‘Umaarah ibn Ru’aybah saw Bishr ibn Marwaan on the minbar raising his hands (Abu Dawood added: when he was making du’aa’ on Friday), and he 
    said: “May Allaah make these two hands ugly. I saw the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) doing no more than 
    this with his hand,” and he gestured with his forefinger. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
This indicates that 
    the Sunnah is not to raise the hands during the khutbah, This is the view of Maalik and our companions and others. 
In Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi it says: 
This hadeeth indicates that it is makrooh to 
    raise the hands on the minbar when making du’aa’. 
As it is not prescribed for the khateeb to 
    raise his hands, the members of the congregation are like him because they follow his lead. 
But if the imam prays for rain on Friday 
    whilst he is on the minbar, the Sunnah is to raise the hands, and for the members of the congregation to raise their hands and make du’aa’ with 
    him. 
Al-Bukhaari (933) and Muslim (897) narrated 
    that Anas ibn Maalik said: The people were stricken with drought at the time of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so 
    whilst the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was delivering the khutbah one Friday, a Bedouin stood up and said, “O 
    Messenger of Allaah, our wealth has been destroyed and our children are hungry, Pray to Allaah for us.” So he raised his hands [al-Bukhaari added 
    in his muta’allaq report: and the people raised their hands with the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) making 
    du’aa’], and we did not see any cloud in the sky. But by the One in Whose hand is my soul, hardly had he lowered (his hands) but there appeared 
    clouds like mountains, and hardly had he come down from his minbar but I saw rain running down his beard  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him). It rained that day, and the day after, and the day after, until the following Friday. Then that Bedouin or someone else stood up and 
    said, “O Messenger of Allaah, our buildings have been destroyed and our wealth had been flooded. Pray to Allaah for us.” So he raised his hands 
    and said, “O Allaah, around us and not on us.” Each time his hand pointed to part of the clouds they parted, and the clouds formed a ring around 
    Madeenah. The wadis flowed with water for a month and no one came from any direction but he spoke of the heavy rain. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy 
    on him) was asked: 
What is the ruling on raising one's hands 
    when the imam is delivering the khutbah on Friday? He replied: 
Raising the hands when the imam is delivering 
    the khutbah on Friday is not prescribed in sharee’ah. The Sahaabah denounced Bishr ibn Marwaan when he raised his hands during the Friday khutbah. 
    But an exception is made in the case of prayers for rain (istisqaa’), because it is proven that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) raised his hands when praying to Allaah for rain during the Friday khutbah, and the people raised their hands with him. But apart from 
    that one should not raise one's hands when making du’aa’ during the Friday khutbah.
