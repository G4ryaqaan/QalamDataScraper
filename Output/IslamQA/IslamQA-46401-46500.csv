46453,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46453,He is suffering because of his Muslim colleagues’ laziness in studying; should he work with non-Muslims?,"I am a student in a school in the west. Praise be to Allaah I spend most of my time with Muslims, but I am suffering because of my own laziness and the laziness of the Muslims here. Hence I have started to prefer working with non-Muslims here in the field of study only. Is that regarded as taking the kuffaar as close friends? What are the conditions of working with them in this case?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Among the most important influences on a person’s attitude 
    and nature, and also on his religious commitment, is the atmosphere 
    surrounding him, including the people with whom he interacts, the place 
    where he lives and the places he frequents. These all affect a person’s 
    feelings and form the values in which he believes; his attitude will be 
    coloured by the various influences around him. The most dangerous situation 
    is when this process happens without his realizing it, or paying attention 
    to it. Hence they say that (human) nature is a thief, it takes from what is 
    around it by stealth, without a person realizing. 

    Because of what we have mentioned above, Islam has defined 
    the atmosphere in which a person should strive to live, by choosing good 
    friends and living in a Muslim environment. It also warns against settling 
    among the mushrikeen or taking them as friends. [See the questions on 
    al-Wala’ wa’l-Bara’ (Loyalty and friendship vs. disavowal and enmity) in the 
    section on ‘Aqeedah (basic tenets of faith)]. See also questions no.
    38284,
    26118 and
    23325. 

    This applies when a person is able to do that and has some 
    control over the situation at times of ease. But in cases of necessity when 
    a person has no other choice and has no control over the matter, then we 
    should speak about doing whatever he can in his best interests, and warding 
    off whatever he can of harm. See question no.
    13363. 

    With regard to your question: before you think about working 
    with non-Muslims, why don’t you think about how to ward off laziness from 
    yourself and your Muslim brothers? 

    Why don’t you try – with your brothers – to give a good 
    impression of what a Muslim should be – serious and hardworking? 

    What I fear is that this conduct will reinforce the image of 
    laziness, neglect and weakness that is often presented of Muslims. By 
    Allaah, this is an old problem of which ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) complained when he said: “O Allaah, to You do I complain of the 
    strength of the evildoer and the incapability of the trustworthy one.” See 
    question no. 43270. 

    But if it is the matter of choosing between working hard with 
    the kuffaar or sleeping among the Muslims, then you should work and strive 
    hard, and strive hard to adhere to your religion and morals which you have 
    learned from your religion; be more keen in protecting your religious 
    commitment than you would be in protecting your wealth and your life. And 
    pay attention to the following: 

    1-    
    Do not take women as study 
    companions, because you know about their attitudes and you know what will 
    result from keeping company with them and mixing with them. Moreover you 
    know that such relationships are forbidden in Islam.

    2-    
    Try to spend as little time as 
    possible among them.

    3-    
    Limit these relationships to 
    that which is required for work and study.

    4-    
    Try to give a good impression 
    of Muslims and their religion and attitude. Link everything good in you to 
    what your religion enjoins upon you.

    5-    
    Remember that your adherence to your religion is something that will make others respect you. Who knows?  Perhaps some of them will be influenced by you and if Allaah guides a single man by means of you, that will be better for you than this world and everything in it. 

    And Allaah is the Source of strength.",Islam Q&A
46455,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46455,She faced social pressures that made her stop praying and take off hijab,"I am a young, single woman from … I work as an engineer in the ministry of industry as head of the department. I am respected and well-treated, and I have a masters degree in industrial engineering. 
I am from a close-knit and wealthy family that has connections with top people in the county, which has made our life easy, praise be to Allaah. 

So far so good. 

But the problem is that I feel alienated. 

Since the age of fifteen, I have not been like the girls in my generation and my society. I hated mixing and I hated the fact that we had no interest in our religion. No day passed when I did not read Soorat al-Baqarah, Aal ‘Imraan, al-Rahmaan and Yaa-Seen, and recite a lot of du’aa’ and tasbeeh. I felt that I was better than my friends and the girls of my generation, and I felt that I was close to our Lord, and I had tranquillity and peace of mind. 

During all this I refused everyone who came to propose marriage, because they were far away from religion and were not committed; they drank alcohol and did many other things that I feel too embarrassed to mention. 

Sometimes those who regarded my mentality as backward would say: You are beautiful and you appear modern, but you are not enjoying your life and you are backward in your thinking like our grandmothers’ grandmothers. 

Yet despite that my faith in Allaah was great and I was strong in the face of all the temptations of life. I found myself in many difficult situations but every time, I chose to be close to our Lord and I overcame my self that is inclined towards evil, praise be to Allaah. 

For the first time I felt that I needed a righteous, religiously-committed husband. I felt that work and study were taking up all my time, but I needed to find a marriage partner and form a family and have children. 

In order to protect myself against the group who I was with in a foreign country, I put on hijab and went to pray in the mosque, and this was for the first time in my life, but they were the happiest 
days of my life, a wonderful experience. 

I realized how far I was falling short in my religious commitment, and how ignorant I was about many things in my religion, and how awful and how faraway from religion our society is.  

But when I went back to our country I took off the hijab due to social, professional and political reasons, but I felt even more alienated and I felt very depressed. 

All the people think that I have changed a great deal, most of all my family, and because of that and in order to get me out of the state I am in, they decided to go for ‘umrah at the time of the Prophet’s birthday. 
, I went, with my father, mother and sister, and it was an indescribable delight. I enjoyed praying in al-Rawdah al-Shareef (the area between the Prophet’s minbar and grave) and I enjoyed praying and making du’aa’ in Makkah, and I enjoyed the conservative Saudi society. I enjoyed wearing the niqaab and abayah, as I have never enjoyed anything else. Those were some of the happiest days of my life. 
When I came back to my country, I took off the hijab. I had no choice but to follow the ways of my society, because of the demands of my job, i.e., meetings with men. I have no choice but to shake hands, and dress as they dress. I work all day until 6 p.m., then I go home and pray Zuhr and ‘Asr and Maghrib and ‘Isha’ all together, because at work we have no time or space to ourselves. Even the places where we could do wudoo’ are mixed.  

I feel sick and tired, and I feel that my faith is very weak, and I am afraid of fitnah (temptation). 

I cannot get married and I cannot live, I cannot do my religious duties and I feel alienated. Either I live like the rest of the people and accept an immoral evildoer (as a husband) – please excuse these words – or I leave this country where everything is detestable. 

I have no objection to marrying someone from outside my country and leaving my country, so long as he is religiously committed and will help me to obey Allaah. 

I have been to all the marriage websites on the internet and this is my last hope. 

The problem now is that I have stopped praying and I have stopped reading Qur’aan because I feel that I am living a life of hypocrisy. I definitely want to wear hijab and I want to get married and protect myself from fitnah. 

All my prayer is weeping and whenever I read Qur’aan I weep bitterly. My life has become very bitter. 

Help me, save me from fitnah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    We understand the extent of the problem that you are 
    suffering and the extent of the pressure you are facing to give up your 
    religion and your commitment. This problem is not yours alone, rather it is 
    a problem faced by thousands of Muslims who want to adhere to the teachings 
    of this great religion, and want to live a moral life of honour and 
    chastity, but they face many problems in their societies that, 
    unfortunately, have deviated from Islam to a large extent and now look down 
    upon and scorn those who adhere to Islam, and governments that cause trouble 
    for those who are committed to Islam. Everyone knows what is going on in 
    your country, the war against Islam and those who are committed to it. We 
    ask Allaah to foil their plots and support His religion and His believing 
    slaves. 

    Secondly: 

    “The reward of Allaah is precious, the reward of Allaah is 
    Paradise.” Thus said the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him), and undoubtedly the precious reward needs a high price, and there 
    is nothing more precious than Paradise. Hence the Muslim must accept that 
    whatever difficulties he faces on his way to Paradise, they are to be 
    expected, and in fact, no matter how hard it is, they pale into 
    insignificance when compared with the delights that await him in Paradise. 

    This is what makes it easy for the Muslim to bear the 
    calamities of this world and the difficulties that he faces on his path 
    towards Allaah. 

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    has told us that the most destitute of the people in this world, of those 
    who will enter Paradise, will be brought and dipped once in Paradise, and it 
    will be said to him: O son of Adam, did you ever see anything bad? Did you 
    ever experience any hardship? He will say: No, by Allaah, O Lord. I never 
    saw anything bad and I never experienced any hardship.”. Narrated by Muslim 
    (2807). 

    The mind can imagine the state of this person, “the most 
    destitute of the people in this world,” and imagine the worst of situations 
    and trials, but one dip in Paradise will make him forget all that.

     And the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) has told us about the days of patience, and that the one who 
    adheres to his religion at that time will be like the one who takes hold of 
    a burning ember. Perhaps the current time is what the Messenger  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) meant, so we have no choice but to be 
    patient and put up with hardships and even confront them, otherwise we may 
    lose out in this world and in the Hereafter: 

    “By Al‑‘Asr (the time).

    2. Verily, man is in loss,

    3. Except those who believe (in Islamic Monotheism) and do 
    righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth [i.e. order one 
    another to perform all kinds of good deeds (Al‑Ma‘roof) which Allaah has 
    ordained, and abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds (Al‑Munkar) 
    which Allaah has forbidden], and recommend one another to patience (for the 
    sufferings, harms, and injuries which one may encounter in Allaah’s Cause 
    during preaching His religion of Islamic Monotheism or Jihad)”

    [al-‘Asr 103] 

    Thirdly: 

    With regard to the social and political pressures that you 
    are facing – and we understand how hard it is – we offer the following 
    advice to you and to everyone who is facing a similar problem, whilst noting 
    that under such pressures a Muslim may face severe difficulty in adhering to 
    the rulings of Islam, so there may be no choice but to compromise and be 
    content with partial commitment for fear of giving up commitment altogether. 
    But that is subject to the condition that the Muslim always seeks that which 
    is better and strives hard to overcome these difficulties and gradually seek 
    to attain full commitment. 

    So this compromise is a temporary stage, it is not 
    permanent. 

    Whatever a Muslim cannot do in full today because of the 
    pressures he is facing, let him do whatever he can of it – even if there are 
    shortcomings – until he gradually reaches a stage of full commitment and the 
    society may accept his transformation from one stage to another, because 
    that is easier than going through confrontations and problems. 

    There follows some advice, and we apologize for making it too 
    long, but the matter is serious and of the utmost importance, and affects 
    thousands and thousands of Muslims as we have said, so one or two words are 
    not enough. 

    1 – “Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah (there is 
    no power and no strength except with Allaah)” 

    This is a beautiful phrase, and it is one of the treasures of 
    Paradise. We have no power to change from one state to another, from 
    disobedience to obedience, from imperfection to perfection, except with the 
    help and guidance of Allaah.  

    So it is essential to seek the help of Allaah first and last. 
    In Soorat al-Faatihah which the Muslim recites several times each day, it 
    says (interpretation of the meaning): “You (Alone) we worship, and You 
    (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything)” [al-Faatihah 1:5].  
    We cannot worship Allaah unless Allaah enables us and helps us to do that. 
    Among the du’aa’ of the people of Paradise are the words (interpretation of 
    the meaning): “All the praises and thanks be to 
    Allaah, Who has guided us to this, and never could we have found guidance, 
    were it not that Allaah had guided us” [al-A’raaf 7:43]. 
    And among the du’aa’ of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) were the words: “Do not leave me to myself even for the 
    blink of an eye.” Al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (226). 

    So it is essential to seek the help of Allaah, rely on Him 
    and be aware that all things are in His hand, and with the word “Kun 
    (Be!)” He does whatever He wills. 

    So seek the help of Allaah and delegate your affairs to Him, 
    and trust that Allaah will grant you a way out: “And whosoever puts his 
    trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him” [al-Talaaq 65:3].  

    2 – Constant du’aa’ 

    Say du’aa’ a great deal, asking Allaah to make things easier 
    for you, to help you to do all that is good, to guide and to keep evil and 
    its people away from you. ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) used to say: “I am not worried whether Allaah will respond, but I am 
    worried about whether I will be able to make du’aa’, because if I am helped 
    to du’aa’, then the response will come with it.” Du’aa’ relieves distress 
    and takes away worry.  

    The Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “There is no Muslim who says a du’aa’ in which there is no sin or 
    severing of family ties, but Allaah will give him one of three things: 
    either He will hasten to answer his prayer, or He will store it up for him 
    in the Hereafter, or He will divert an equivalent evil from him.” They said: 
    Then we will say a lot of du’aa’! He said: “Allaah can give more than that.” 
    Narrated by Ahmad (10794), classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh 
    al-Targheeb (1633). The one who says du’aa’ is always in a good state, 
    no matter how much du’aa’ he says, for Allaah is greater in goodness, 
    blessing and grace. 

    3 – Worship, especially prayer 

    You have to pay attention to acts of worship, for they will 
    revive the heart and alert the one who is negligent, and they are among the 
    most important factors of steadfastness and the best help in achieving one’s 
    goals, after the help of Allaah, may He be exalted. 

    The greatest act of worship is prayer, for it is the main 
    foundation of faith after the shahaadatayn and it is the foundation of 
    Islam. The heart has no life without prayer. It brings relief from all 
    worries and hardships. Hence the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) used to say to Bilaal: “Let us find rest in it (the prayer), O 
    Bilaal.” Saheeh Abi Dawood (4985). So pray, and focus with proper 
    humility, and ponder, and weep, and relieve yourself of the worries and 
    stress of this world. 

    4 –Reading the Holy Qur’aan 

    Read the Holy Qur’aan regularly, and have a portion of it 
    that you read every day, and do not neglect it. You should also have a brief 
    Tafseer (commentary) that will help you to understand and ponder the 
    meanings of the verses, such as Tafseer al-Sa’di or Aysar 
    al-Tafaaseer by Shaykh Abu Bakr al-Jazaa’iri. 

    There is nothing greater than the words of Allaah, and there 
    is no exhortation more eloquent than the exhortation of Allaah. There is no 
    book that can offer guidance or relief from worry like the Qur’aan. 

    5 – Adhkaar and du’aa’s 

    Always recite the adhkaar that are narrated from the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) at various times and on 
    various occasions, such as the adhkaar for morning and evening, when going 
    to sleep and when waking up, when eating and drinking, when going out of the 
    house and when coming in, and in all situations. Be certain of the 
    importance of understanding their meanings. Among the useful books on this 
    topic are: al-Futoohaat al-Rabbaaniyyah bi Sharh al-Adhkaar al-Nawawiyyah 
    by Ibn ‘Allaan. This is a valuable book from which you can learn the 
    meanings of the adkhaar, so that hearts may be revived and become connected 
    to the Knower of the Unseen. 

    6 – Listening to useful lectures and khutbahs 

    Continue to listen to useful lectures and khutbahs, for you 
    always need someone to remind you, guide you and advise you. From lectures 
    etc you can learn a great deal about the rulings of Islam and how to behave 
    at times of crisis. 

    7 – It is essential to read and learn. 

    It is essential for you to learn, read and educate yourself 
    in Islamic matters, for “whomever Allaah wills good to, He causes him to 
    understand Islam”, as was narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. So it is 
    essential to know and understand the rulings of Islam. In many cases where 
    things seem difficult and complicated, if a person learned the rulings or 
    asked the scholars, he would find it easy and not complicated. There may be 
    a concession of which he is not aware, or there may be an alternative in 
    sharee’ah that would make it easier for him. Among the useful books that we 
    advise you to read is Fiqh al-Sunnah by Shaykh Sayyid al-Saabiq [this 
    is available in English translation under the title Fiqh us-Sunnah, 
    published in 5 volumes by American Trust Publications,  Plainfield, IN]; 
    al-Mulakhkhas al-Fiqhi by Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan; ‘Awdat al-Hijaab 
    by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ismaa’eel. You can also learn from useful Islamic 
    websites. 

    You should also read modern history, especially that of your 
    own country, and how Islam has been fought, and what their plots were, for 
    if the Muslim understands that, it will inspire him to face the challenge 
    and make him adhere to Islam even more. 

    8 – With regard to marriage 

    It is undoubtedly very important, and will bring many 
    benefits in your case, such as: 

    (a)  
    Psychological stability, peace 
    of mind and tranquillity.

    (b) 
    By Allaah’s leave, it will be a 
    means of reducing the social and family pressures on you, because you will 
    be able to move to a new home, away from your family and neighbours and the 
    society which is placing many restrictions on you that you cannot overcome.

    (c) 
    You will be able to raise 
    righteous offspring in an atmosphere of chastity, trust, modesty and 
    adherence to this religion, the upbringing that many of us have missed out 
    on, unfortunately. 

    A person can do with his children that which he wishes that 
    his parents had done with him. Raising righteous offspring is one of the 
    most important benefits of marriage. The ummah is waiting for you and others 
    like you who love this religion and want to adhere to it. They are waiting 
    for righteous, believing offspring from you, through whom Allaah will 
    benefit the ummah and change it for the better. 

    There are many other benefits that you will attain through 
    marriage, hence we emphasize the importance of this issue. Based on the 
    circumstances that you are suffering, the advice which we have to offer you 
    is: if there comes to you one with whose religious commitment and character 
    you are pleased, do not hesitate to accept, and if there is no such person 
    then be content with one who is “semi-committed”, for if we cannot find that 
    which is perfect we must be content with the best that is available, even if 
    it is not perfect. This advice is just for you, based on your particular 
    situation. 

    We do not mean by this that you should be content with an 
    evildoer or one who drinks alcohol, not at all. Rather what we mean is one 
    who is righteous in general terms, who prays regularly and loves Islam in 
    general, one who is of good character and chivalrous, who feels protective 
    jealousy with regard to matters of honour, even if he has some other 
    faults. 

    You could encourage him to improve, by means of your 
    personality, your powers of persuasion and your wisdom in dealing with him, 
    after Allaah guides you and him. 

    We do not agree that your going to websites is the last hope 
    for you, rather hope never ceases. The Muslim always has hope and expects 
    good from his Lord, and he thinks positively of his Lord Who says in the 
    hadeeth qudsi: “I am as My slave thinks I am.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari and 
    Muslim. 

    9 – With regard to the problem of hijab and your not being 
    able to wear it 

    Once again, we state that we understand the extent of the war 
    that you are facing in your country because of hijab, hence we think that 
    there is no reason why – given your particular circumstances – you should 
    not take a gradual approach to wearing hijab. What your parents and society 
    may not accept today, they may accept gradually after a month or two, or a 
    year. 

    You have to dress as modestly as possible, and try hard to 
    cover your head. Wear clothes that are loose, then when the people get used 
    to your dressing modestly, you can take another step forward, until you are 
    wearing full hijab as Allaah has enjoined upon the believing women and as 
    you yourself want and enjoyed wearing in the land of the two sacred mosques 
    during your visit. 

    But do not be too hasty. Take it slowly, and you will attain 
    what you want, in sha Allaah. 

    This is not the best way that the Muslim should follow, but 
    it is acceptable in cases of necessity and in the particular circumstances 
    that you are in. Attaining part of a thing is better than nothing, and 
    reaching perfection slowly is better than losing everything.  

    10 –With regard to prayer 

    Prayer is the greatest of the pillars of Islam after the 
    Shahaadatayn. It is the connection between a person and his Lord, so you 
    should pay a great deal of attention to it and it is essential to offer 
    prayers regularly, at the proper times. 

    “Verily, As‑Salaah (the prayer) is enjoined on the 
    believers at fixed hours”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:10] 

    We do not think there is any problem with regard to Fajr and 
    ‘Isha’, or with Maghrib during the summer, when the time for Maghrib begins 
    an hour or two after you come back from work. 

    Based on that, there is no excuse for delaying these prayers 
    beyond the proper time, so strive hard to offer these prayers at the time 
    decreed for them in sharee’ah.  

    That leaves Zuhr and ‘Asr, and also Maghrib during the 
    winter. 

    The basic principle – as stated above – is that you should 
    offer each of them at the proper time, so look for a time when the place for 
    doing wudoo’ is free of men. If that is not possible, there is nothing wrong 
    with entering the washroom and doing wudoo’ in there, and wudoo’ done there 
    will be valid. In most cases its floor – even if it is wet – will be taahir 
    (pure) and the water that is on it will be taahir, so there is nothing wrong 
    with doing wudoo’ in there. 

    When praying, a woman is required to cover all of her body 
    except her face and hands. If you cannot wear clothes like that for the time 
    being, then keep a hijab or other garment for prayer in your office, that 
    you can wear at the time of prayer. 

    There is no special place where prayers must be performed, 
    rather prayers may be offered anywhere, so you can wait for a chance when 
    you are alone in your office, and then pray. 

    If it is too difficult and you cannot offer every prayer on 
    time, then we hope that you will have a concession allowing you to join Zuhr 
    and ‘Asr, so you can delay Zuhr until the time of ‘Asr and pray them 
    together, but that is subject to the condition that it is done before the 
    time for ‘Asr ends, and that is half an hour or forty-five minutes before 
    sunset. If that is not possible, then you have a concession allowing prayer 
    until sunset, but there is no excuse for delaying ‘Asr until after sunset.

    With regard to Maghrib in the winter, if you can do it at 
    work then this is what you must do, and if that is not possible then you may 
    delay it and join it with ‘Isha’ at the time of the latter, and you can pray 
    Maghrib and ‘Isha’ together when you go back home. 

    Remember that if you do that, you are not delaying the prayer 
    beyond its proper time, because joining Zuhr and ‘Asr, and Maghrib and 
    ‘Isha’, is permissible in cases of necessity and in order to ward off 
    hardship, whether one is travelling or not, unlike shortening the prayers, 
    which is not permitted except when travelling. 

    But you must try hard to offer every prayer at the proper 
    time, and the Muslim should always be able to find a way. A senior military 
    figure was unable to ask for permission to pray, lest he be accused of 
    fundamentalism or terrorism and be put under watch, so he used to ask 
    permission to go to the bathroom, where he would do wudoo’ then go and pray, 
    and come back. 

    We do not think that you are incapable of coming up with some 
    way and finding an opportunity to offer every prayer on time. If you cannot, 
    then join Zuhr and ‘Asr as described above. 

    Finally, we would draw your attention to the fact that many 
    of the problems that you are facing at work, such as delaying the prayers 
    and not being able to wear hijab, are due to your working in a place where 
    you mix with men. 

    A woman’s working in a place where she mixes with men, with 
    no shar’i guidelines, leads to many negative consequences, as is obvious to 
    you. Hence the wisdom of Islam dictates that this is haraam. If you can move 
    to another department or another job where there are no men, this will solve 
    your problems at work to a great extent, or you can choose to stop working 
    altogether, unless you are facing pressure from your family to carry on 
    working, in which case we hope that you have a concession to allow you to 
    continue, whilst trying to avoid the bad things as much as possible. 

    Finally, we will be happy to keep in ouch with you and offer 
    advice, and  we will be even happier to hear that you have acted upon this 
    advice and that you have taken steps in the right direction. 

    We ask Allaah to make you steadfast and to help you to do all 
    that is good, and to divert all evil away from you, and to bless you with 
    righteous offspring. 

    And Allaah is the source of strength and the Guide to the 
    right path. 

    And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
