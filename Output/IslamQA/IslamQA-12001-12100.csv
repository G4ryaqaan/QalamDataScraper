They gather together and give a key to the young person who has reached the age of 21. Are these things permitted in Islam?",,,"Praise be to Allah.What you have mentioned about celebrating and reciting Qur’aan when a young man or woman reaches the age of twenty-one has no basis in sharee’ah. It is bid’ah and a kind of imitating the Christians around you. It was proven in the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever does an action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam) will have it rejected.” (Narrated by Muslim and by Ahmad in al-Musnad). And Abu Dawood narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.”

12032,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12032,Celebrating completing the Qur’aan (khatm al-Qur’aan),"Some women, when they finish learning the Qur’aan by heart from their shaykhah, organize a simple celebration in which they read from the end of  the Mus-haf and immediately add something from the beginning (al-Faatihah and five aayaat of al-Baqarah) so that their reading will not cease. What is the ruling on that?",,,"Praise be to Allah., and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allaah.
 Celebrating the completion of memorizing the Qur’aan is not Sunnah, because nothing of that nature was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or from any of his Sahaabah. Doing this on the grounds that it is part of religion is bid’ah. But people do it as a customary expression of joy for the blessing of having memorized Qur’aan, like celebrations for the return of one who has been away, or for finding work, or for moving to a new home. If the celebration for completing the Qur’aan is of this nature, then there is nothing wrong with it. If a passage from the Qur’aan is recited, from the beginning or the end, without having to recite a specific soorah or recite in a particular way such as joining the end to the beginning, then this is fine, because reciting from Qur’aan is the best thing that can be done in a gathering and it is a reminder for those who are present. With regard to making du’aa’ when completing the recitation of the Qur’aan, it was reported with a saheeh isnaad from Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) that when he completed the Qur’aan, he would gather his family together and make du’aa’ with them. If the reader makes du’aa’ when he completes the Qur’aan, and those who are present say “Ameen” to his du’aa’, this is fine.
 With regard to calling the teacher “shaykhah” , there is nothing wrong with this. Now you know, may Allaah bless you, that there is no reason not to have the celebration you have described. There is no need to read from the end of the Mus-haf and then join it to the beginning. Doing something in this manner requires evidence (daleel), because reading Qur’aan is an act of worship, and acts of worship must be done only in the manner in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did them, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day, and remembers Allaah much” [al-Ahzaab 33:21]
 Written by Shaykh ‘Abd-Al-Rahmaan al-Barraak
 There is a hadeeth about the person who stops for a rest immediately carrying on, which was narrated by al-Tirmidhi (may Allaah have mercy on him) from Ibn ‘Abbaas. According to this hadeeth, a man said, “O Messenger of Allaah, which deed is most beloved to Allaah? He said, “Al-haal al-murtahil.” The man said, ‘What is al-haal al-murtahil?” He said, “The one who starts from the beginning of the Qur’aan until he reaches the end, and when he stops for a rest, he immediately carries on.”
 But this hadeeth is da’eef (weak), as al-Tirmidhi (may Allaah have mercy on him) says after he quotes it: this is a ghareeb (strange) hadeeth which we only know from Ibn ‘Abbaas with this isnaad, and this isnaad is not strong.
 Hence Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-I’laam (p.289, part2), after he mentioned this hadeeth: Some of them understood from this that when a person has finished reading the whole Qur’aan, he should then read al-Faatihah and three verses of Soorat al-Baqarah, because he stopped when he completed it, and he continued when he started again. But none of the Sahaabah or Taabi’een did this, and none of the imaams regarded it as mustahabb (encouraged). What is referred to in the hadeeth is when a person returns from one military campaign and immediately joins another, or every time he completes one good deed, he starts another which he  completes as he did the first one. But what some readers do is not what was meant in the hadeeth at all. And Allaah is the source of strength.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
12033,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12033,Permissibility of praying in shoes,"Is it permissible to pray wearing shoes when necessary, or not?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, 
          that is permissible, because the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed wearing his shoes. 
          In al-Saheeh it is narrated 
          that Abu Sa’eed said: The Messenger of Allaah  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) lead us in prayer whilst 
          he was wearing his shoes, then he took them off [whilst still praying], 
          and the people took their shoes off too. When the Messenger of Allaah 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) said the Tasleem 
          [at the end of the prayer], they said: “O Messenger of Allaah, you took 
          off your shoes, so we took off our shoes too.” He said: “Jibreel came 
          to me and told me that there was some dirt on them, so I took them off. 
          When any one of you comes to the mosque, let him look at his shoes, 
          and if he sees any dirt on them, let him wipe them. And they can be 
          purified with dust.” 
(Narrated 
          by Abu Dawood, no. 650). 
          The point here is that praying in shoes is permissible. It says in the 
          hadeeth: “Be different from the Jews, pray wearing your slippers or 
          shoes.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, no. 652). 
          But the condition is that the shoes must be taahir (pure, clean). If 
          there is any najaasah (impurity) or dirt on the shoes, then one should 
          not pray wearing them or enter the mosque in shoes, unless he is sure 
          that they are free of impurity or dirt. And Allaah knows best.","Fataawa Samaahat al-Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Humayd, p. 93"

12053,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12053,Guidance is in the Hand of Allah,"How can we reconcile between the aayahs/verses (interpretation of the meanings): “Verily, you (O Muhammad) guide not whom you like” [al-Qasas 28:56] and “And verily, you (O Muhammad) are indeed guiding (mankind) to the Straight Path” [al-Shooraa 42:52]?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allah has created man and given him reason, and He has sent down to him Revelation and sent to him Messengers to call him to the truth and warn him against falsehood. Then He has left him to make his own choice. 
“And say: ‘The truth is from your Lord.’ Then whosoever wills, let him believe; and whosoever wills, let him disbelieve.” [al-Kahf 18:29 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Allah commanded His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to convey the truth to all of mankind. Then they have the choice to do as they wish. If a person obeys, he benefits himself, and if he disobeys, he harms himself, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say: ‘O you mankind! Now truth (i.e. the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad), has come to you from your Lord. So whosoever receives guidance, he does so for the good of his own self; and whosoever goes astray, he does so to his own loss; and I am not (set) over you as a Wakeel (disposer of affairs to oblige you for guidance).’” [Yoonus 10:108] 
Islam is the religion of the natural state of man (fitrah), the religion of reason and thought. Allah has distinguished the truth from falsehood. He has enjoined all that is good and forbidden all that is evil. He has permitted good things and forbidden evil things. There is no compulsion in religion because the benefits or harms come back upon the created being, not upon the Creator. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“There is no compulsion in religion. Verily, the Right Path has become distinct from the wrong path. Whoever disbelieves in taghoot (false gods) and believes in Allah, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break.” [al-Baqarah 2:256]  
And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Whosoever does righteous good deeds, it is for (the benefit of) his ownself; and whosoever does evil, it is against his ownself. And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) slaves.” [Fussilat 41:46] 
Guidance is in the hand of Allah. If Allah willed, He could guide all of mankind, for there is nothing that He cannot do on this earth or in the heavens. Nothing happens in His Dominion except that which He wills. 
“Say: ‘With Allah is the perfect proof and argument, (i.e. the Oneness of Allah, the sending of His Messengers and His Holy Books, to mankind); had He so willed, He would indeed have guided you all.’” [al-An’am 6:149 – interpretation of the meaning] 
But in His Wisdom, Allah has created us with the ability to choose, and He has sent down to us guidance and the Criterion. So whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger will enter Paradise and whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger will enter Hell, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, proofs have come to you from your Lord, so whosoever sees, will do so for (the good of) his ownself, and whosoever blinds himself, will do so to his own harm, and I (Muhammad) am not a watcher over you.” [al-An’am 6:104] 
The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has no part in guidance; all that he and the Muslims have to do is to explain and convey the message, and show them guidance but they cannot force people to follow it, as Allah said to His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And had your Lord willed, those on earth would have believed, all of them together. So, will you (O Muhammad) then compel mankind, until they become believers?” [Yoonus 10:99] 
And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And the duty of the Messenger is only to convey (the Message) plainly.” [al-‘Ankaboot 29:18] 
Guidance to the truth is in the hand of Allah alone and no human being has any share in that, as Allah said to His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, you (O Muhammad) guide not whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills. And He knows best those who are the guided.” [al-Qasas 28:56]  
Allah guides whomsoever He wills and sends astray whomsoever He wills. He has told us that He guides those who obey Him and turn to Him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“While as for those who accept guidance, He increases their guidance and bestows on them their piety.” [Muhammad 47:17] 
But whoever disobeys Allah and turns away from Him, Allah will not guide him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Truly, Allah guides not him who is a liar, and a disbeliever.” [al-Zumar 39:3] 
Allah is Omniscient and knows what has happened and is happening and what is yet to come. Allah knows the believers and the disbelievers, and what they will do, and He knows what their fate will be in the Hereafter. He has written all this in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz (the Preserved Tablet), as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And all things We have recorded in a Book.” [al-Naba 78:29] 
Allah has created man with the ability to choose, and He has created him able to do both, either believe or disbelieve, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, We showed him the way, whether he be grateful or ungrateful.” [al-Insan 76:3] 
Man has the choice in terms of his reason only; if he loses his reason by which he is able to distinguish between the alternatives of good and evil, truth and falsehood, then he is not accountable. Hence according to Islamic sharee’ah (law), the pen is lifted from the insane person (i.e., he is not accountable) until he recovers his senses, and from the child until he reaches the age of understanding, and from the sleeper until he wakes up. None of these people are accountable until they gain or recover the reason by which they may distinguish between the alternatives of faith and disbelief, truth and falsehood, and so on. 
Whatever direction a person takes, there will be reward and punishment. If he obeys, there will be Paradise: 
“Indeed he succeeds who purifies his ownself (i.e. obeys and performs all that Allah ordered, by following the true Faith of Islamic Monotheism and by doing righteous good deeds.” [al-Shams 91:9 – interpretation of the meaning] 
And if he disobeys, there will be Hell: 
“And indeed he fails who corrupts his ownself (i.e. disobeys what Allah has ordered by rejecting the true Faith of Islamic Monotheism or by following polytheism, or by doing every kind of evil wicked deed.” [al-Shams 91:10 – interpretation of the meaning] 
The choice of one of these two ways is something about which a person will be questioned by the Lord of the Worlds. Hence it is clear that faith or disbelief, obedience or disobedience, is a matter of personal choice. Allah has made reward and punishment dependent upon this choice: 
“Whosoever does righteous good deeds, it is for (the benefit of) his ownself; and whosoever does evil, it is against his ownself. And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) slaves.” [Fussilat 41:46] 
Whoever loves Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and desires good in this world and in the Hereafter, let him enter Islam, and whoever turns away from that and is content with this world and has no interest in the Hereafter and does not submit, then his abode will be Hell. The individual is the one who will benefit or harm himself. There is no compulsion to choose either.  Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, this (Verses of the Quran) is an admonition, so whosoever wills, let him take a Path to his Lord (Allah).” [al-Insan 76:29]

12085,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12085,"He speaks improperly with a woman, with the excuse that he is teaching her","I am a girl who has been on the Internet for a short time, but I have noticed that some people are very confused and they mix truth with falsehood. From the way some of them speak, they appear to be good and pious, but some of the things they do are very strange.
 When I first starting going on the Internet, some of the sites I went to were chat rooms. I admit that this was a mistake on my part, but I have put matters right, alhamdu-Lillaah. I stopped going into chat rooms two weeks after I started. But whilst I was visiting chat rooms I got to know a man who, from what he says, appears to be righteous and pious, and keen to pursue good. He tries to put right whatever he can, and he sends out letters containing words of religious exhortation by e-mail to everyone he knows. He goes into chat rooms on the basis of the belief and principle that he adheres to, which is that good people should be present in these sites, in which there are a lot of bad people, in order to crowd out the bad people. 
 The main thing is that I stopped going to the chat rooms, but I continued to communicate with him by e-mail. He was trying to persuade me that I had to go to the chat rooms in order to reform the women, because women are closer to other women, especially on sites where there are so many women that the “wolves” are tempted to come and “hunt” them. I did not respond to his request because I knew how damaging it is to go to those sites where the evil outweighs the good. The way he spoke to me in his letters was very respectful and he was very selective in the words he chose; I was equally careful in the way I spoke to him. This encouraged me to ask him to teach me the basics of the Internet via e-mail, or, if that was not possible, via “messenger”. He agreed to do that via “messenger” so we started the lessons, and he carried on being respectful and serious. But I noticed that sometimes he would joke or get carried away in talking about matters that had nothing to do with the lesson, which he called educational topics. And he also asked about some personal matters such as the city where I live, etc. I knew that he was in touch with a group of women with whom he discussed educational matters and the state of the Muslims, etc., and that these discussions might go on for hours. I did not like this state of affairs and I told him that frankly. I also told him that this joking was not permitted, and that he should be formal when speaking with women, and not use certain phrases. He quoted as evidence that it is permissible to speak with women the fact that the shaykhs answer questions from women; and he quoted as evidence that it is permissible to joke the hadeeth “No old women will enter Paradise” – meaning that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was joking with that old woman when he said that to her. He said that being too formal and reserved may lead to the opposite result. I was not convinced by his arguments, because from the little knowledge that I have, this is not permitted. I asked him to complete the lessons via e-mail and not to use the “messenger”, and until now he has not replied at all. I find it strange and wonder how he could do that when he has reached such a high level of knowledge and religious commitment, as well as being haafiz al-Qur’aan (i.e., he has memorized the Qur’aan by heart). I want to point out that this is a subtle trap that is one of the snares of the Shaytaan, by means of which he confuses people. What is the final word on this problem?

If that is the case, then this money will detract from their reward,

12088,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12088,Kuwaitis being paid through the United Nations for the delay in compensation from the Iraqis,"One of the laws concerning compensation for those  who were affected by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait is that those who were expelled from Kuwait should be given salaries for the period during which they were exiled, in addition to a lump sum to be decided by the UN – which is supervising the payment of compensation – which is a penalty on Iraq for not paying this amount all this time. Is it permissible for those who were affected by the war to take this additional amount or not?",,,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn 
          Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, who answered as follows: 
          
 He may take as much as he lost, but 
          it is not permissible for him to take more because this is riba.  
          Even if we assume that it is a penalty, it should be given to the Bayt 
          al-Maal (treasury) of the Muslims, he (the individual) has no right 
          to it. 
 Question: when they try to justify it, 
          they say: this is money which you had the right to take ten years ago. 
          If you had taken it ten years ago, you could have benefited from it 
          and invested it, so this additional sum is compensation for withholding 
          it all this time. 
 Answer: This is not permissible according 
          to sharee’ah, because firstly, if he had taken the money at that time 
          and used it, he could have lost it. Secondly, it is not permissible 
          to take an additional amount in return for delaying payment, as stated 
          above. 
 Question: does the fact that the additional 
          amount was not stipulated in advance change anything? 
 Answer: It does not change anything, 
          and it is not permissible to take the additional amount even if it was 
          not stipulated in advance. Moreover, it is known that the one who is 
          paying this amount is being forced to do so.",Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen

12093,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12093,"When women get together, is it better for them to pray in jamaa’ah or individually?",Is it better for women in the prayer-rooms of women’s colleges to pray together in jamaa’ah or individually? Which will bring the greater reward?,,,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, may Allah preserve him, who answered as follows:
 It is better for them to pray in jamaa’ah, if possible, but the reward of twenty-seven times more applies only to men, because praying in jamaa’ah is obligatory for them.
 “The correct view is that for women to pray in jamaa’ah, and for a woman to lead other women in prayer, are things that are permitted in Islam and indeed are mustahabb for them. The evidence (daleel) for that is the hadeeth of Um Waraqah that we have referred to above, in which it states that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave her permission to lead the (female) members of her household in prayer… It is also confirmed by the fact that some of the Mothers of the Believers led other women in prayer. It was reported from Laytah al-Hanafiyyah (from the tribe of Banu Haneefah) that ‘Aa’ishah the Mother of the Believers led them in the obligatory prayer. And it was narrated from Tameemah bint Saleemah that ‘Aa’ishah the Mother of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with her) led women in Maghrib prayer, and that she stood in the middle of them and recited Quran aloud. It was also narrated that Um Salamah the Mother of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with her) used to lead women in prayer in Ramadan, and that she stood with them in the row. And it was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar used to tell one of his slave women to lead his womenfolk in prayer in Ramadan.”

12096,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12096,Preferring some Messengers over others,"How can we reconcile between the two aayahs (interpretation of the meaning):

“Those Messengers! We preferred some of them to others [al-Baqarah 2:253]

 and :  

“We make no distinction between any of them [al-Baqarah 2:136]?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The aayah (interpretation of the meaning):  
“Those Messengers! We 
    preferred some of them to others
[al-Baqarah 2:253] 

    is like the aayah: 
“And indeed, We have 
    preferred some of the Prophets above others”
[al-Isra’ 17:55] 

    There is no doubt that some of the Prophets and Messengers 
    are superior to others; the Messengers are superior to the Prophets, and the 
    “Messengers of strong will” (cf. al-Ahqaaf 46:35) are superior to all the 
    others. The Messengers of strong will are the five whom Allaah has mentioned 
    in two verses of the Qur’aan, the first of which is in Soorat al-Ahzaab: 
“And (remember) when We 
    took from the Prophets their covenant, and from you (O Muhammad), and from 
    Nun (Noah), Ibraaheem (Abraham), Moosa (Moses), and ‘Eesa 
    (Jesus) son of Maryam (Mary)”

    [al-Ahzaab 33:7 – interpretation of the meaning] 
    – these are Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), Nooh, 
    Ibraaheem, Moosa and ‘Eesa ibn Maryam. 

    The second verse is in Soorat al-Shoora: 

    “He (Allaah) has ordained for you the same religion 
    (Islamic Monotheism) which He ordained for Nooh (Noah), and that which We 
    have revealed to you (O Muhammad), and that which We ordained for Ibraaheem 
    (Abraham), Moosa (Moses‎) and ‘Eesa (Jesus)”

    [al-Shoora 42:13 – interpretation of the meaning].

    These five are superior to all others.  

    With regard to what Allaah says concerning the believers 
    (interpretation of the meaning) – 
“Each one believes in 
    Allaah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say,) ‘We make no 
    distinction between one another of His Messengers’”
    [al-Baqarah 2:136] –  

    what this means is: we make no distinction between them in 
    terms of belief, we believe that they are all truly Messengers from Allaah, 
    and that they did not tell lies, so they all spoke the truth. This is the 
    meaning of the phrase “We make no distinction between one another of His 
    Messengers”, i.e., in terms of belief: we believe that they were all 
    truly Messengers from Allaah. 

    But in terms of the kind of belief that implies following, 
    for those who come after the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him), this applies only to the Messenger  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him). He is the one to be followed because his sharee’ah 
    (law) abrogates all other laws. Hence we know that we must believe in all of 
    them and believe that they are truly Messengers from Allaah, but after the 
    Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was sent, all 
    previous religions were abrogated by his sharee’ah, and it became obligatory 
    upon all people to follow Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) only. Allaah by His wisdom abrogated all religions apart from the 
    religion of the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), 
    hence He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): O 
    mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allaah — to Whom 
    belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. Laa ilaaha illa Huwa 
    (none has the right to be worshipped but He). It is He Who gives life and 
    causes death. So believe in Allaah and His Messenger (Muhammad), the Prophet 
    who can neither read nor write (i.e. Muhammad), who believes in Allaah and 
    His Words [(this Qur’aan), the Tawraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) and 
    also Allaah’s Word: “Be!” — and he was, i.e. ‘Eesa (Jesus) son of Maryam 
    (Mary)], and follow him so that you may be guided” [al-A’raaf 7:158]. 

    So all religions other than that of the Messenger  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) are abrogated, but we must still 
    believe in the Messengers and that they are true.","From the fatwas of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, Kitaab Fataawa Islamiyyah, 1/81"
12099,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12099,Benefits of believers’ trials,"Why does Allah burden the believers who do many acts of worship with sickness and other trials, when the sinners are enjoying all the good things in life?",,,"Praise be to Allah.This question may be asked in two ways, either as an objection or as a quest for understanding. If it is asked as an objection, then it is an indication of the questioner’s ignorance. For the wisdom of Allah is too great for our minds to comprehend. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And they ask you (O Muhammad) concerning the Rooh (the spirit). Say: The Rooh (the spirit) is one of the things, the knowledge of which is only with my Lord. And of knowledge, you (mankind) have been given only a little”[al-Isra’ 17:85]
This spirit is something which is within us and is the very essence of our lives, but we do not know it and the philosophers and thinkers are unable to define and describe it. If we are unable to know anything about this spirit, which is the closest thing in creation to us, apart from that which has been described in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, then what do you think about other matters beyond that? Allah is Most Wise, Most Great, Most Majestic and Most Powerful, and we must submit to His will and decree with full submission, because we are unable to comprehend the ultimate goals of His wisdom. On this basis, the answer to the question is that we should say: Allah knows best and He is Most Wise, Most Powerful and Most Great. 
If the question is asked as a quest for understanding, then we would tell this questioner: the believer is subjected to tests and Allah’s testing him by means of things that may harm or hurt him brings two great benefits. The first benefit is that Allah tests this man with regard to his faith, to see whether his faith is sincere or shaky. The believer whose faith is sincere will patiently accept the will and decree of Allah, and will seek reward from Him. In this case the matter becomes bearable for him. It was narrated that one of the female worshippers of Allah suffered a cut or wound in her finger, but she did not complain about the pain or show any sign of distress. She was asked about that and she said: The sweetness of its reward makes me forget the bitterness of bearing it. The believer seeks reward from Allah and submits to Him completely. This is one benefit. 
With regard to the second benefit, Allah highly praises those who are patient and says that He is with them and that He will give them reward without measure. Patience is a high status which can only be attained by those who are tested with things that they bear patiently. If he bears them patiently, he attains this high status which brings great reward. So when Allah tests the believers with things that hurt them, that is so that they may attain the status of those who are patient. Hence the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who was the greatest of all people in faith, piety and fear of Allah, suffered twice the pain of an ordinary man when he fell sick, and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) suffered greatly at the time of death, so that he might fully attain the status of one who is patient, for he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was the most patient of those who are patient. Hence the wisdom behind Allah’s testing of the believer with such calamities becomes clear. 
With regard to His giving the sinners, evildoers, immoral people and kaafirs good health and plentiful provision, this is in order to let them get carried away (with their sin, and then punish them severely later on). It was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “This world is a prison for the believer and a paradise for the kaafir. They are given these good things so that they have their good things sooner, in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will get what they deserve of punishment. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“On the Day when those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism) will be exposed to the Fire (it will be said): “You received your good things in the life of the world, and you took your pleasure therein. Now this Day you shall be recompensed with a torment of humiliation, because you were arrogant in the land without a right, and because you used to rebel against Allah’s Command (disobey Allah)” [al-Ahqaaf 46:20]
The point is that this world is for the kaafirs to get carried away in, then when they move to the Hereafter and leave the life of this world in which they found pleasure, they will encounter torment – we seek refuge with Allah. The punishment will be so much harder for them because they will suffer greatly, and because at the same time they will have lost the delights and luxuries of this world which they loved so much.  
There is a third benefit which we may add to the first two, which the believer will get from sickness and problems, for the believer will move to a realm that is better than this world, for he will move from something that hurts him and causes him pain to something that will bring him happiness and joy. So his joy at the delight to which he has come will be multiplied, because he has attained joy, and the pain and difficulties that he was facing will have ceased.","From the fatwas of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, from Kitaab Fataawa Islamiyyah, 1/83"
