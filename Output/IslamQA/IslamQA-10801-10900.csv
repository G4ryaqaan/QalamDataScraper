10805,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10805,Is Life Insurance Halal in Islam?,Is it permissible to take out life insurance so as to ensure that my family will be provided for after I die? Please provide the evidence for your response.,"Life insurance or insurance of one’s possessions is haram in Islam because it involves deceit. For more, see the detailed answer.",,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about life insurance, and he said: 
Insurance of one’s life or possessions is haram and is not permitted, because it involves gharar (buying/selling something where it is not known whether what is being bought/sold will actually be achieved/delivered, or in what specific quantity, thus putting one’s money at undue risk to being lost) and riba (usury, interest).
Allah has forbidden all transactions that are based on riba, and all transactions which involve deceit, as a mercy to this ummah, and to protect them from that which may harm them. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“…whereas Allah has permitted trading and forbidden riba” [al-Baqarah 2:275]
And it was narrated in a sahih report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade deceit.

10809,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10809,What are the things that make faith decrease?,What are the things that make faith decrease?,,,"Praise be to Allah.The things that make faith decrease are as follows: 
1.Ignorance of the names and attributes of Allaah makes a decrease in faith inevitable, because if a man is lacking in knowledge of the names and attributes of Allaah, he will be lacking in faith.
2.Neglecting to think about the signs of Allaah in the universe and the signs of sharee’ah (i.e., verses of the Qur’aan and miracles of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), etc.). This causes a decrease in faith or at the very least it causes it to stagnate and not grow.
3.Committing sins, because sin has a profound effect on the heart and on faith. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The adulterer at the time when he is committing adultery is not a believer.”
4.Neglecting to do acts of worship, because neglecting to do acts of worship causes a decrease in faith. But if the act of worship is obligatory and a person neglects it with no excuse, then he is to be blamed and deserves punishment. If the act of worship is not obligatory, or it is obligatory but a person does not do it for a valid reason, then he is lacking but is not to be blamed. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) described women as lacking in reason and in religion, and he explained their lacking in religion as being because of the fact that when they menstruate, they do not pray or fast. But they are not to be blamed for not praying or fasting during their menstruation; rather they are commanded not to do these things at that time. But because they miss out on doing some of the things that men do, they are regarded as lacking in this regard.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il Fadeelat al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 1. p. 57"
10817,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10817,Ruling on obtaining the previous scriptures,Is it permissible for a Muslim to obtain the Injeel (Gospel) to find out the words of Allaah to His slave and Messenger ‘Eesa (Jesus – peace be upon him)?,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to obtain any of the previous scriptures which came before the Qur’aan, such as the Injeel (Gospel or New Testament), Tawraat (Torah or Old Testament) and others, for two reasons.  
The first reason is that anything in them that is beneficial has been explained by Allaah in the Qur’aan.  
The second reason is that the Qur’aan frees us from any need for these books. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“It is He Who has sent down the Book (the Qur’aan) to you (Muhammad) with truth, confirming what came before it [Aal ‘Imraan 3:3]
 “And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad) the Book (this Qur’aan) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and Mohaymin (trustworthy in highness and a witness) over it (old Scriptures). So judge among them by what Allaah has revealed [al-Maa’idah 5:48]
 So whatever good may be in the previous books is to be found in the Qur’aan.
 With regard to the questioner’s statement that he wants to find out what Allaah said to His slave and Messenger ‘Eesa, this information is to be found in what Allaah has told us in the Qur’aan. So there is no need to look elsewhere. Moreover, the Injeel (Gospel) that is extant today is distorted. The evidence for that is the fact that there are four Gospels which contradict one another; there is no one Gospel which can be relied upon. 
But the seeker of knowledge who has sufficient knowledge to be able to tell truth from falsehood, may be allowed to read (the previous scriptures) in order to refute the falsehood found therein or to leave the followers of the scriptures with no excuse for not knowing that they are false.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il Fadeelat al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 1, p. 32-33"
10823,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10823,"If a person has land and other property, does he have to pay zakaah on it?","If a person has land and other property that is not invested and that does not bring in any income or returns, does he have to pay zakaah on it?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.No zakaah is due on this land and property unless he has prepared it for sale. 
The way in which its zakaah is calculated is that its value should be calculated after one (Hijri) year has passed, then one-quarter of one-tenth should be paid as zakaah, i.e., 2.5%. 
But if this property is prepared for a person to use, or he uses it for business purposes such as renting it out and the like, and he is not trading in it, then there is no zakaah on it in this case. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said, discussing the issue of zakaah on stores: 
Trade goods refers to wealth that is prepared for trade. The dealer does not seek these goods for themselves, rather he seeks their profits. Hence we are obliged to pay zakaah on their value and not on the goods themselves. 
So the phrase “trade goods” refers to anything that is prepared for trade, whatever type it is. This heading covers most of the things on which zakaah is to be paid, because it includes real-estate, fabric, vessels, animals, and everything else. 
Zakaah is obligatory on trade goods, and the evidence for that is as follows: 
1 – It is included in the general meaning of the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And in their properties there was the right of the Saa’il (the beggar who asked) and the Mahroom (the poor who does not ask others)”
[al-Dhaariyaat 51:19]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Mu’aadh ibn Jabal when he sent him to the Yemen: “Teach them that Allaah has enjoined upon them charity (zakaah) from their wealth, to be taken from their rich and given to their poor.” 
Undoubtedly trade goods are a kind of wealth. 
If someone were to say that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “The Muslim does not have to pay zakaah on his slave or his horse,” our response would be yes, that is correct, but he did not say that there is no zakaah on trade goods that are not sought for themselves but are sought for their value. The phrase “his slave and his horse” refer to his own possessions, i.e., things that are his own property and that he uses and benefits from, like his horse, or his slave, or his clothes, or the house in which he lives, or the car that he uses even if it is for hire (i.e., a taxi). On all of these things there is no zakaah, because a person acquires them for his own use, and he does not acquire them in order to trade them in the sense of buying them today and selling them tomorrow.  Based on this, whoever quotes this hadeeth to say that there is no zakaah on trade goods is making a far-fetched claim. 
Secondly: 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Actions are but by intentions, and each person will have what he intended.” If we were to ask the trader or businessman what he wants from this wealth, he would say “I want gold and silver.” 
If I buy the goods today and sell it tomorrow and make money on it, the objective is not to acquire the object itself at all. Based on this, we say that zakaah on trade goods is obligatory according to the texts and according to analogy, even though the texts are not specific, rather they are general in meaning. 
Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/141-142 
Then he said, giving an example of that: 
A man bought a car in order to make money from it (i.e., to sell it and make a profit from it). This is trade goods whose value reached the nisaab and he intended to sell it when he bought it, so he has to pay zakaah on it. But if he bought the car in order to use it, then it occurred to him that he should sell it, then there is no zakaah on it, because when he took possession of it, he had no intention of doing trade. So he has to have the intention of doing trade at the moment when he acquires it. If he buys something for the purpose of trade but it does not reach the nisaab, and he does not have anything else he can add to it, there is no zakaah on it, because one of the conditions of zakaah is that the wealth should reach the nisaab. 
Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/142. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Land that is prepared for sale is subject to zakaah. The evidence for that is the well-known hadeeth narrated from Samurah ibn Jundub (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded us to pay zakaah on everything that was prepared for sale.”  
But if the land is bought to keep, and not re-sale, whether it is intended for farming, housing, rental or whatever, there is no zakaah due on it because it is not being prepared for sale. And Allaah knows best.

          we advise this husband to repent to Allaah from drinking alcohol, because 
          drinking alcohol is haraam according to the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah 
          of His Messenger  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) and the consensus of the Muslims. Allaah says 
          (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O 
          you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, 
          and Al Ansaab [stone altars for offering sacrifices to idols etc.], 
          and Al Azlaam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination 
          of Shaytaan’s (Satan’s) handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) 
          in order that you may be successful. 
Shaytaan 
          (Satan) wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants 
          (alcoholic drinks) and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance 
          of Allaah and from As‑Salaah (the prayer). So, will you not then 
          abstain? 
And 
          obey Allaah and the Messenger (Muhammad), and beware (of even coming 
          near to drinking or gambling or Al‑Ansaab, or Al‑Azlaam) 
          and fear Allaah. Then if you turn away, you should know that it is Our 
          Messenger’s duty to convey (the Message) in the clearest way” [al-Maa'idah 
          5:90-92]
It 
          was narrated that the Prophet  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Every intoxicant is liquor 
          and every liquor is haraam.” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Ashribah 
          3735)  
The scholars 
          are unanimously agreed, with no dispute on this matter. Some of the 
          scholars even considered the prohibition of alcohol to be one of the 
          most well known teachings of Islam (ignorance of which is inexcusable). 
          So our advice to him is that he should give up drinking alcohol, and 
          be content with [?] that which Allaah has permitted to him of good drinks, 
          and not seek that which Allaah has forbidden. Alcohol is the mother 
          of evil and the key to all evil. Allaah has issued a stern warning to 
          those who drink it and do not repent from that. It was narrated from 
          Jaabir that the Messenger of Allaah  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:  “Allaah has 
          made a covenant to those who drink alcohol, that He will make them drink 
          teenat al-khabaal.” They said, “O Messenger of Allaah, what is 
          teenat al-khabaal?” He said, “The sweat of the people of Hell,” 
          or, “The juice of the people of Hell.” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Ashribah, 
          3732)  
It is easy to give it up if one is sincere 
          and determined, and seeks the help of Allaah, may He be exalted.
With regard to yourself, there is no sin 
          on you if your husband drinks alcohol, because a person will not be 
          brought to account for the sins of another. Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning):
“And 
          no bearer of burdens shall bear another’s burden”[Faatir 35:18]
Rather, 
          you will be rewarded for your sincere advice to your husband. Your living 
          with him is not haraam, because drinking alcohol does not make him a 
          kaafir. So keep on calling him, advising him and making du’aa’ for him, 
          and may Allaah cause him to repent. If your keeping away from him in 
          bed will serve the purpose of deterring him and making give up alcohol, 
          then it is permissible, but if it will not achieve anything, then do 
          not do it. We ask Allaah to guide us all and give us strength. For

Before we discuss the different views on this matter, we should point out that there is no dispute at all concerning the kind of acting which involves promiscuity and the mixing of men and women, and other kinds of evil actions, which is well-known on the screen. There is no dispute among the scholars concerning the prohibition of such acting.
The kind of acting concerning which there is a difference of opinion is that which is done by two or more people in front of a group of others, using actions and dialogue, in order to teach that group something about Islamic worship or morals, or to help them understand reality and the corruption that exists, or to teach them about the glories of the past, or for purposes of entertainment – in which they may present themselves in a way that differs from the way they really are. This kind of acting must be subject to certain guidelines, as follows:
1-Avoiding acting the parts of Prophets, the Sahaabah, shayaateen (devils), kaafirs and animals. Avoiding men playing the parts of women and vice versa. Avoiding acting the parts of unseen beings such as angels.
2- Playing the part of one who mocks Allaah, His signs, His Messenger or any of the rituals of Islam, even if the aim is to teach the people. No one is permitted to act in such a manner, regardless of whether he means it or is joking.
3- Playing any role which involves any kind of speech that is haraam, such as lying or backbiting; or which involves making the clothes too long, etc.
4- Acting out any acts of worship such as wudoo’ or prayer in an incorrect manner which is not that reported in the Sunnah. 
One should avoid playing the role of evil or immoral characters, or playing the role of the imaams or prominent scholars of the ummah, lest that lead to an undermining of their status.
Some of the contemporary scholars said that acting is forbidden altogether; others said that it is permitted so long as it meets certain conditions. Among the latter was Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him). There follows his fatwa on the topic:
“Praise be to Allaah the Lord of the Worlds. There is no doubt that calling people to Allaah (da’wah) is an act of worship, as Allaah commands us (interpretation of the meaning):
‘Invite (mankind, O Muhammad) to the way of your Lord (i.e. Islam) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Qur’aan) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better”[al-Nahl 16:125]
The person who is calling others to Allaah feels, when he is calling them to Allaah, that he is fulfilling the command of Allaah and drawing closer to Him. Undoubtedly the best way in which he can call people is with the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). For the Book of Allaah is the greatest preaching method that can be used when advising mankind:
‘O mankind! There has come to you a good advice from your Lord (i.e. the Qur’aan, enjoining all that is good and forbidding all that is evil), and a healing for that which is in your breasts, — a guidance and a mercy (explaining lawful and unlawful things) for the believers”[Yoonus 10:57 – interpretation of the meaning]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said likewise: “The best of speech is preaching.” Sometimes he used to preach to his Companions in a manner that they described as “making the heart tremble and the eyes fill with tears.” So if a person can use this means of preaching, undoubtedly this is the best means, i.e., by using the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). But if he thinks that sometimes he can add other permissible methods, using things that Allaah has permitted, there is nothing wrong with that. But this is subject to the condition that these means should not involve anything that is forbidden such as lying or playing the roles of kaafirs, for example, or playing the roles of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) or the imaams – the leaders of the Muslims after the Sahaabah – or similar things where there is the fear that this may lead to the people looking down on any of these great imaams… Another of the conditions is that this acting should not involve men imitating women or vice versa, because this is a matter concerning which it is reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed those who do it. He cursed the women who imitate men and the men who imitate women.
The point is that if some of these means are used occasionally in order to attract people, and they do not involve anything haraam, I do not think that there is anything wrong with that. But if it is done frequently and is made the only means of calling people to Allaah, and one turns away from calling them with the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so that the people who are being called cannot be moved by any other means, then I think that this is not right, and in this case it becomes haraam, because directing the people towards anything other than the Qur’aan and Sunnah in matters that have to do with calling people to Allaah is a reprehensible action. But I do not see anything wrong with doing that occasionally, so long as it does not involve anything haraam.”
 And Allaah knows best.

Types of Shirk


Impact of showing off on acts of worship","Praise be to Allah.This question involves two issues, Bid`ah (innovation) and Shirk (polytheism, association of others with Allah). 

Bid`ah

This issue may be divided into three topics:

Definition of Bid`ah
Categories of Bid`ah
Rulings on one who commits Bid`ah – does that make him a disbeliever or not? 

What is Bid`ah?
Shaykh Muhammad ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“According to Shari`ah, the definition of Bid`ah is `Worshipping Allah in ways that Allah has not prescribed.’ If you wish you may say, `Worshipping Allah in ways that are not those of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or his rightly guided Caliphs.’” 
The first definition is taken from the verse (interpretation of the meaning):
“Or have they partners with Allah (false gods) who have instituted for them a religion which Allah has not ordained?”  [Ash-Shura 42:21] 
The second definition is taken from the Hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who said:
“I urge you to adhere to my way (Sunnah) and the way of the rightly-guided Caliphs who come after me. Hold fast to it and bite onto it with your eyeteeth [i.e., cling firmly to it], and beware of newly-invented matters.” 
So everyone who worships Allah in a manner that Allah has not prescribed or in a manner that is not in accordance with the way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or his rightly-guided Caliphs, is an innovator, whether that innovated worship has to do with the names and attributes of Allah, or to do with His rulings and laws. 
With regard to ordinary matters of habit and custom, these are not called Bid`ah (innovation) in Islam, even though they may be described as such in linguistic terms. But they are not innovations in the religious sense, and these are not the things that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was warning us against. 
And there is no such thing in Islam as Bid`ah hasanah (good innovation).” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, vol. 2, p. 291) 
Categories of Bid`ah 
Bid`ah may be divided into two categories: 

Bid`ah which constitutes disbelief  
Bid`ah which does not constitute disbelief 

Bid`ah which constitutes disbelief 
 If you ask, what is the definition of Bid`ah which constitutes disbelief and that which does not constitute disbelief? 
The answer is: 
Shaykh Hafith Al-Hakami (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The kind of Bid`ah which constitutes disbelief is when one denies a matter on which there is scholarly consensus, which is widely-known, and which no Muslim can have any excuse for not knowing, such as denying something that is obligatory, making something obligatory that is not obligatory, or making something prohibited permissible, or making something permissible prohibited; or believing some notion about Allah, His Messenger and His Book when they are far above that, whether in terms of denial of affirmation  – because that means disbelieving in the Quran and in the message with which Allah sent His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Examples include the Bid`ah of the Jahmiyyah, who denied the attributes of Allah; or the notion that the Quran was created; or the notion that some of the attributes of Allah were created; or the Bid`ah of the Qadariyyah  who denied the knowledge and actions of Allah; or the Bid`ah of the Mujassimah who likened Allah to His creation… etc. 
Bid`ah which does not constitute disbelief 
The second category, Bid`ah which does not constitute disbelief, is defined as that which does not imply rejection of the Quran or of anything with which Allah sent His messengers. 
Examples include the Marwani Bid`ahs (which were denounced by the greatest Companions (who did not approve of them, although they did not denounce them as disbelievers or refuse to give them Bay`ah because of that), such as delaying some of the prayers until the end of the due times, doing the ‘Eid Khutbah before the ‘Eid prayer, delivering the Khutbah whilst sitting down on Fridays, etc.” (Ma`arij Al-Qubul, 2/503-504) 
Can you call one who commits Bid`ah  a disbeliever? 
The answer is that it depends. 
If the Bid`ah constitutes disbelief, then the person is one of the following two types: 

Either it is known that his intention is to destroy the foundations of Islam and make the Muslims doubt it. Such a person is definitely a disbeliever; indeed, he is a stranger to Islam and is one of the enemies of the faith.
Or he is deceived and confused; he cannot be denounced as a disbeliever until proof is established against him, fair and square. 

If the Bid`ah does not constitute disbelief, then he should not be denounced as a disbeliever. Rather, he remains a Muslim, but he has done a gravely evil action. 
How should we deal with those who commit Bid`ah? 
The answer is: 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“In both cases, we have to call these people – who claim to be Muslim but who commit acts of Bid`ah which may constitute disbelief or may be less than that – to the truth, by explaining the truth without being hostile or condemning what they are doing. But once we know that they are too arrogant to accept the truth – for Allah says (interpretation of the meaning), `And insult not those whom they (disbelievers) worship besides Allah, lest they insult Allah wrongfully without knowledge.’ [Al-An`am 6:108] – if we find out that they are stubborn and arrogant, then we should point out their falsehood, because then pointing out their falsehood becomes an obligation upon us. 
With regard to boycotting them, that depends upon the Bid`ah. If it is a Bid`ah which constitutes disbelief, then it is obligatory to boycott the person who does it. If it is of a lesser degree than that, then it is essential to examine the situation further. If something may be achieved by boycotting the person, then we do it; if no purpose will be served by it, or if it will only make him more disobedient and arrogant, then we should avoid doing that, because whatever serves no purpose, it is better not to do it. And also in principle it is impermissible to boycott a believer, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: `It is not permissible for a man to forsake [not speak to] his brother for more than three [days].’” (Adapted from Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, vol. 2, p. 293) 

Shirk, its types and the definition of each 

Types of Shirk
Shaykh Muhammad ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Shirk is of two types, major Shirk which puts a person beyond the pale of Islam, and minor Shirk .” 

The first type, major Shirk , is “Every type of Shirk which the Lawgiver described as such and which puts a person beyond the pale of his religion” – such as devoting any kind of act of worship which should be for Allah to someone other than Allah, such as praying to anyone other than Allah, fasting for anyone other than Allah or offering a sacrifice to anyone other than Allah. It is also a form of major Shirk to offer supplication (Du`a) to anyone other than Allah, such as calling upon the occupant of a grave or calling upon one who is absent to help one in some way in which no one is able to help except Allah. 
The second type is minor Shirk , which means every kind of speech or action that Islam describes as Shirk, but it does not put a person beyond the pale of Islam – such as swearing an oath by something other than Allah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that whoever swears an oath by something other than Allah is guilty of disbelief or Shirk .

The one who swears an oath by something other than Allah but does not believe that anyone other than Allah has the same greatness as Allah, is a Mushrik who is guilty of lesser Shirk, regardless of whether the one by whom he swore is venerated by people or not. It is not permissible to swear by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or by the president, or by the Ka`bah, or by Jibril, because this is Shirk, but it is minor Shirk which does not put a person beyond the pale of Islam. 
Another type of minor Shirk is showing off, which means that a person does something so that people will see it, not for the sake of Allah. 
Impact of showing off on acts of worship
The ways in which showing off may cancel out acts of worship are either of the following: 

The first is when it is applied to an act of worship from the outset, i.e., the person is not doing that action for any reason other than showing off. In this case, the action is invalid and is rejected, because of the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) which was attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), which says that Allah said, “I am so Self-sufficient that I am in no need of having an associate. Thus he who does an action for someone else’s sake as well as Mine will have that action renounced by Me to him whom he associated with Me.” (Narrated by Muslim, Kitaab Az-Zuhd, 2985) 
The second is when the showing off happens later on during the act of worship, i.e., the action is originally for Allah, then showing off creeps into it. This may be one of two cases: 

The first is when the person resists it – this does not harm him.
For example, a man has prayed a Rak`ah, then some people come along during his second Rak`ah and it occurs to him to make the Ruku` or Sujud longer, or makes himself weep, and so on. If he resists that, it does not harm him, because he is striving against this idea. But if he goes along with that, then every action which stemmed from showing off is invalid, such as if he made his standing or prostration long, or he made himself weep – all of those actions will be cancelled out. But does this invalidation extend to the entire act of worship or not? 
We say that either of the following must apply: 

Either the end of his act of worship was connected to the beginning (with no pause); so if the end of it is invalidated then all of it is invalidated.

This is the case with the prayer – the last part of it cannot be invalidated without the first part also being invalidated, so the whole prayer is invalid.

Or if the beginning of the action is separate from the end of it, then the first part is valid but the latter part is not. Whatever came before the showing off is valid, and what came after it is not valid. 

An example of that is a man who has a hundred Riyals, and gives fifty of them in charity for the sake of Allah with a sound intention, then he gives fifty in charity for the purpose of showing off. The first fifty are accepted, and the second fifty are not accepted, because the latter is separate from the former.” (Majmu` Fatawa wa Rasa’il Ibn `Uthaymin, and Al-Qawl Al-Mufid Sharh Kitab Al-Tawhid, vol. 1, p. 114, 1st edition)

      is not permissible to take a gradual approach in applying the rulings –
      unlike the case at the beginning of Islam. In the case of alcohol, for
      example, every Muslim is obliged to believe that it is haraam to drink it.
      Whoever believes otherwise – when he is aware of the prohibition – is
      a murtadd (apostate), because he is denying something which is well known
      to be forbidden in Islam, from the evidence of sharee’ah, and by
      scholarly consensus. 
      
 With
      regard to the commandments of sharee’ah, the extent to which one is
      obliged to do them is connected to the extent of one's ability to do them.
      One is not obliged to do that which one is not able to do or that which
      will cause one undue difficulty or harm. Everyone will be held accountable
      according to his own circumstances. Whether or not jihaad is obligatory on
      an individual or on the ummah as a whole depends on the situation. We
      cannot say that this is the matter of a gradual approach in legislation
      (sharee’ah). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

          are called Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah (the People of the Sunnah 
          and the Community). Everyone who follows the way brought by the Messenger 
          of Allaah  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) is one of them. The Messenger of Allaah  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) brought the message of Tawheed 
          (absolute Oneness of Allaah) and rejection of shirk (polytheism, 
          or association of others with Allaah); he called people to worship Allaah 
          alone and none other. With regard to the word “Wahhaabis”, some people 
          use this word to refer to the message of Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab 
          ibn Sulaymaan al-Tameemi al-Hanbali (may Allaah have mercy on him), 
          and they call him and his followers Wahhaabis. Everyone who has any 
          knowledge of the movement of Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab (may 
          Allaah have mercy on him) and his message knows that he sought to spread 
          the message of pure Tawheed and to warn against shirk in all 
          its forms, such as attachment to the dead, or to trees and rocks, etc. 
          In his ‘aqeedah (belief), he was following the way of the righteous 
          Salaf and the Taabi’een [i.e., the earliest generations of Islam], as 
          is indicated by his books and fatwas, and the books of his followers 
          among his sons and grandsons and others. All of these books are in print 
          and are in circulation among the people. His message was in accordance 
          with the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Wahhaabism is not a new 
          way or a new school of thought; rather it is a call to Tawheed and the 
          revival of aspects of the religion that had been forgotten. What you 
          have to do is to beware of those who warn you against the Wahhaabis,

Halal in Islam is that in which there is no sin in doing it and no sin in not doing it.,"What does haram mean?


What does halal mean?


Who has the right to say what is halal and what is haram?","Praise be to Allah.What does haram mean?
Haram is that for which the one who does it may be punished and the one who abstains from it will be rewarded, if the reason for his abstinence is following the prohibition of Allah. 
What does halal mean?
The halal is that in which there is no sin in doing it and no sin in not doing it, but if a person intends to enhance his obedience to Allah by doing it, then he will be rewarded for this intention.
Who has the right to say what is halal and what is haram?
Dictating what is halal and what is haram is the right of Allah Alone. There are people who make halal some of that which Allah has forbidden, and people who make haram some of that which Allah has permitted. 
Some people invent acts of worship which have not been prescribed by Allah and which in fact He has forbidden. The basic principle of religion is that the halal is that which Allah and His Messenger have permitted, and the haram is that which Allah and His Messenger have forbidden. 
The religion is that which Allah and His Messenger have prescribed. No one has the right to go beyond the limits of the Straight Path with which Allah sent His Messenger. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And verily, this is My straight path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His path. This He has ordained for you that you may become Al-Muttaqun (the pious)” [al-An’am 6:153]
Allah mentions in Surah al-A’nam, Surah al-A’raf and elsewhere the things for which He condemns the mushrikin (polytheists, those who associate others in worship with Allah), which is that they made haram things which Allah had not forbidden, such as the bahirah and saibah (camels to which certain taboos were attached for the sake of their idols), and they permitted things which Allah had forbidden, such as killing their children, and they prescribed in their religion things that Allah had not permitted. So Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Or have they partners with Allah (false gods) who have instituted for them a religion which Allah has not ordained?” [al-Shura 42:21]
These things included things that are haram in and of themselves, which they made into acts of worship, such as shirk (associating others in worship with Allah) and things which are obscene, such as performing Tawaf around the Ka`bah naked, etc.

It also involves specifying a certain number, which is something that is a tawqeefi matter (i.e., it can only be known through revelation) and cannot be known through ijtihaad or reason. Using this method is bid’ah (reprehensible innovation), and it was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever innovates something in this matter of ours (i.e., Islam) that is not a part of it, will have it rejected.”(Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim).

And in some other hadiths, it is narrated that it is two taslims (i.e., four rak`ahs), as stated in the hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), (narrated) in Sahih Muslim.

10897,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10897,She wants to hang up her graduation photo in the room where men sit,"I'm going to be graduating soon and it's a family tradition for the pictures of the graduands of the family to be put on a wall in our living room at home,InshaAllaah my family intend to come from overseas for my graduation and they'll probably expect me to wear make-up e.t.c and to have a potrait taken which will be added to the wall at home,the thing is,we have male family friends who sometimes sit in the sitting room so they'll see my picture.I've told my mother it's haraam to have pictures in the house,but she doesn't want to know and wether or not I put my potrait on the wall there'll still be pictures everywhere and I won't have the right to remove them.InshaAllaah they won't be able to force me to wear make-up,but my NOT doing a potrait will probably upset them and they might think they've come all the way for nothing as it will seem to them like I'm not making an effort.So InshaAllaah what do you suggest I do?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The most correct view is that making photographic 
          images comes under the general prohibition of making images of animate 
          beings. The matter is more serious if the picture is of a woman (and 
          men look at it) because of the fitnah and evil involved in that. The 
          fact that people will be angry does not make these haraam things permissible. 
          The anger of Allaah is that which most deserves to be feared. If Allaah 
          knows that His slave is sincere, He will be with him. The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever seeks to 
          earn the pleasure of Allaah even though that makes people angry, Allaah 
          will be pleased with him and will make the people pleased with him.”",Shaykh Waleed al-Firyaan
