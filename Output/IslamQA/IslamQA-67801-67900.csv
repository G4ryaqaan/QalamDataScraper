Is it permissible to initiate the greeting by saying `Alayk As-Salam or `Alaykum As-Salam? 


What is the best way to greet someone in Islam?","Praise be to Allah.Is greeting with Salamun `Alaykum Correct?
There is nothing wrong with the person who is initiating the greeting saying, “Salamun `alaykum” or `Salamun `alayka.” Allah tells us that the greeting of the angels to the people of Paradise will be “Salamun `alaykum ” as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And angels shall enter unto them from every gate (saying): `Salamun `Alaykum (peace be upon you) for you persevered in patience! Excellent indeed is the final home!’” [Ar-Ra`d 13:23, 24]
“And those who kept their duty to their Lord (Al-Muttaqun – the pious) will be led to Paradise in groups till when they reach it, and its gates will be opened (before their arrival for their reception) and its keepers will say: Salamun `Alaykum (peace be upon you)! You have done well, so enter here to abide therein.” [Az-Zumar 39:73] 
The Salam in this form is also mentioned in the verse where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Those whose lives the angels take while they are in a pious state (i.e. pure from all evil, and worshipping none but Allah Alone) saying (to them): Salamun `Alaykum (peace be on you) enter you Paradise, because of that (the good) which you used to do (in the world).” [An-Nahl 16:32] 
“And when they hear Al-Laghw (dirty, false, evil or vain talk), they withdraw from it and say: `To us our deeds, and to you your deeds. Peace be to you (Salamun `Alaykum). We seek not (the way of) the ignorant.’” [Al-Qasas 28:55] 
“When those who believe in Our Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) come to you, say: Salamun `Alaykum (peace be on you); your Lord has written (prescribed) Mercy for Himself, so that if any of you does evil in ignorance, and thereafter repents and does righteous good deeds (by obeying Allah), then surely, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Al-An`am 6:54] 
Ibn Hibban narrated (493) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man passed by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he was in a gathering and said, “Salamun `alaykum.” He (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) said, “Ten rewards.” Another man passed by and said, “Salamun `alaykum wa rahmatu-Allahi (Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah).” He said, “Twenty rewards.” Then another man passed by and said, “Salamun `alaykum wa rahmatu-Allahi wa barakatuhu (Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah and His blessings).” He said: “Thirty rewards.” A man got up and left the gathering and did not say Salam. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “How soon your companion has forgotten. When one of you comes to a gathering and says Salam, if he wants to sit down then let him do so. Then when he wants to leave, let him say Salam, for the one is not more important than the other.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Targhib wal-Tarhib, 2712) 
This and other evidence indicates that there is nothing wrong with saying Salam to a person by saying “Salamun `alaykum.”  He will be rewarded for that, and he deserves a response to his Salam. 
Which is better: As-Salamu `alaykum or Salamun `alaykum?
The scholars differed as to which version is better, As-Salamu `alaykum or Salamun `alaykum, or whether they are both the same. 
Al-Mardawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Insaf (2/563): “If a person greets a living person, then the correct view in our Madhhab is that he has the choice between using the definite form (with Al-) or the indefinite (without Al-). And he said: this was stated by more than one.”
Then he mentioned a report from Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) which says that the definite form is better than the indefinite, and he quoted Ibn `Aqil (may Allah have mercy on him) as saying that the indefinite is better than the definite.  
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Adhkar (p. 356-358): 
“Note that it is preferable for the Muslim to say “As-Salamu `alaykum wa rahmatu-Allahi wa barakatuhu”, using the plural pronoun (-kum), even if he is greeting only one person. The respondent should say, “Wa `alaykum As-Salam wa rahmatu-Allahi wa barakatuhu.” 
Our companions said: If the one who is initiating the greeting says, “As-Salamu `alaykum,” then he has given the greeting. If he said “As-Salamu `alayka” or “Salamun `alayka” this also counts as the greeting. 
As for the response, the minimum is to say, `Wa `alayka As-Salam” or “Wa `alaykum As-Salam.” If the waw is omitted and one says, “`Alaykum As-Salam” that is sufficient and is a response. 
If the person who is initiating the greeting says “Salamun `alaykum” or “As-Salamu `alaykum,” in both cases the respondent may say, “Salamun `alaykum” , or he may say, “As-Salamu `alaykum”. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“When they came in to him and said: `Salam, (peace be upon you)!’ He answered: `Salam, (peace be upon you)’” [Adh-Dhariyaat 51:25]
Imam Abul Hasan Al-Wahidi (may Allah have mercy on him), one of our companions, said: You have the choice between using the definite form (As-Salam) or the indefinite (Salamun). 
I (An-Nawawi) say: But the alif and lam are preferable (i.e., saying the word Salam with the definite article Al-).” 
Is it permissible to initiate the greeting by saying `Alayk As-Salam or `Alaykum As-Salam? 
What is disliked is for the one who is initiating the greeting to say ‘`Alayka As-Salam’ or ‘`Alaykum As-Salam,’ because this is the greeting given to the dead as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said. 
Abu Dawud (5209) and At-Tirmidhi (2722) narrated that Abu Jurayy Al-Hujaymi (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “ `Alayka As-Salam (upon you be peace), O Messenger of Allah.” He said, “Do not say ` `Alayka As-Salam’, for `Alayka As-Salam’ is the greeting of the dead.” This Hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud. 
What is meant by the Prophet’s words “`Alayka As-Salam’ is the greeting of the dead” is the fact that many poets and others greeted the dead in this manner. Moreover the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is to greet the dead in the same manner as he greeted the living, by saying “As-Salamu `alaykum.” 
Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining that: 
“His greeting, when he was initiating the greeting, was to say, “As-Salamu `alaykum wa rahmatu-Allah”. He did not like the initiator to say “`Alayka’l-Salam.” Abu’l-Jurayy Al-Hujaymi said: I came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “ `Alayka As-Salam (upon you be peace), O Messenger of Allah.” He said, “Do not say ‘`Alayka As-Salam’, for `Alayka As-Salam’ is the greeting of the dead.” (This Hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)
This Hadith confused some people, who thought that it contradicted what was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about greeting the dead by saying, “As-Salamu `alaykum,” saying the word Salam first. They thought that his words, “`Alayka As-Salam’ is the greeting of the dead” was describing what is prescribed, but that is a mistake which led them to think that there was a contradiction. Rather what is meant by the words “`Alaykas-Salam’ is the greeting of the dead” is a statement of something that used to happen, not something that was prescribed, namely that the poets and others used to greet the dead in this manner, and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not like the greeting commonly used for the dead to become widespread.” (Zad Al-Ma`ad, 2/383)
What is the best way to greet someone in Islam? 
The most complete form of greeting is to say “As-Salamu `alaykum wa rahmatu-Allahi wa barakatuhu (Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah and His blessings)” or “Salamun `alaykum wa rahmatu-Allahi wa barakatuhu”, because of the Hadith of Ibn Hibban quoted above, and because of the Hadith narrated by Abu Dawud (5195) and At-Tirmidhi (2689) from `Imran ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “As-Salamu `alaykum,” and he returned the greeting, then he sat down. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Ten.” Then another man came and said, “As-Salamu `alaykum wa rahmatu-Allah,” and he returned the greeting, then he sat down. He said, “Twenty.” Then another man came and said As-Salamu `alaykum wa rahmatu-Allahi wa barakatuhu,” and he returned the greeting, then he sat down. He said, “Thirty.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud)
As for adding the words “wa maghfiratuhu (and His forgiveness)” or “wa ridwanuhu (and His pleasure)”, these are not mentioned in any authentic report from our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as was stated by Ibn Al-Qayyim in Zad Al-Ma`ad (2/381) and by Al-Albani in Da`if Abu Dawud (5196).  
And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
67804,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67804,"If he attends a funeral without offering the prayer, will he still get a qiraat of reward?","If a person attends a funeral without offering the prayer, will he get the qiraat, or is it essential to offer the prayer in order to get this reward?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The Sunnah indicates that the one who attends the funeral until he offers the prayer will have one qiraat, and whoever attends until the deceased is buried will have two qiraats. 
Al-Bukhaari (1325) and Muslim (945) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever attends the funeral until the prayer has been offered will have one qiraat (of reward) and whoever attends until the deceased has been buried will have two qiraats.” It was said, “What are the two qiraats?” He said: “Like two great mountains.” 
Muslim (945) narrated from Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqaas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he was sitting with ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) when Khabbaab came and said: “O ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar, have you not heard what Abu Hurayrah is saying? (He says) that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, ‘Whoever goes out with a funeral from the house (of the deceased) until he offers the funeral prayer, then he goes with it until (the deceased) is buried will have two qiraats of reward, each of which is like (Mount) Uhud. And whoever offers the funeral prayer then leaves will have reward like Uhud.’” Ibn ‘Umar sent Khabbaab to ‘Aa’ishah to ask her about what Abu Hurayrah had said, then come back and tell him what she said. Ibn ‘Umar picked up a handful of pebbles from the mosque and turned them over in his hand until his messenger came back and said: “ ‘Aa’ishah said: Abu Hurayrah is speaking the truth.” Ibn ‘Umar threw the pebbles in his hand onto the floor and said: “We have missed out on many qiraats.” 
A qiraat is a large amount of reward, which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) likened to the mountain of Uhud.  
The qiraat which is earned by offering the prayer – can it be attained by offering the prayer only, or must one also go with the funeral procession from the deceased’s house? 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said: According to the report of Khabbaab which is narrated by Muslim, “Whoever goes out with a funeral from the house (of the deceased).” Ahmad reported from the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri: “And walks with it.” This implies that the qiraat is earned only by those who attend from the outset, until the prayer is over. This was stated clearly by al-Muhibb al-Tabari and others. It seems to me that the qiraat may also be earned by those who only offer the funeral prayer, because everything that happens before the prayer is a means that leads to it. But the qiraat of the one who prays only is less than the qiraat of the one who walks with the funeral procession and offers the prayer. The report narrated by Muslim from Abu Hurayrah says, “The least of them is like Uhud,” which indicates that the qiraats may vary. 
End quote from Fath al-Baari, 3/234 
Secondly: 
With regard to one who follows a funeral procession but does not offer the prayer or attend the burial, he is not included in this promise, but there is the hope that he will attain some reward for his intention. 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: al-Zayn ibn al-Munayyir said: the qiraat is earned only by the one who follows the funeral procession and offers the prayer, or follows the funeral procession and attends the burial, not by one who follows it then leaves without praying. That is because following the funeral procession is a means that leads to one of two things, either the prayer or the burial. If a person takes the means without achieving the ends, then he will not attain the consequences of achieving the ends, although there is the hope that the one who does that will be rewarded according to his intention. End quote from Fath al-Baari, 3/230. 
Thirdly: 
The apparent meaning of the hadeeth is that the qiraat which is earned by attending the burial is only achieved if it is preceded by offering the funeral prayer for the deceased. Al-Bukhaari (47) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever attends the funeral of a Muslim out of faith and in the hope of reward, and stays with him until the funeral prayer has been offered for him and the burial is finished, comes back with two qiraats of reward.” 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
What this implies is that the two qiraats are only attained by the one who stays (with the funeral procession) all the way, until the deceased is buried. If he prays then goes to the grave by himself and attends the burial, he will only earn one qiraat. End quote from Fath al-Baari, 3/234. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Kitaab al-Janaa’iz min Buloogh al-Maraam: One of the things that we learn from the hadeeth (i.e., the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah quoted at the beginning of this answer) is that the two qiraats are earned only by the one who attends the prayer and the burial, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever attends [the funeral] until the burial.” It is well known that the prayer comes before the burial. 
If a person attends the burial without attending the prayer, such as if a man passes by some people in the graveyard who are burying a deceased person, and he joins them and helps them with the burial, there is nothing in the hadeeth to indicate that a person who attends the burial only will earn the qiraat. Rather he will only earn a qiraat by attending the burial if he also attended the prayer. It is not necessarily the case that a person who earns a reward by doing one thing in conjunction with another will earn it by doing it on its own. End quote. 
To conclude, there are five categories of attending funerals: 
1 – Attending from the time the deceased is brought out of his house, until the funeral prayer is offered for him and the burial is finished. This is the most complete category, for which there are two huge qiraats of reward. 
2 – Attending from the time the deceased is brought out of his house, until the funeral prayer is offered for him. This brings one qiraat of reward. 
3 – Offering the funeral prayer for him, even if one did not come with the deceased from the time he was brought out of his house. This brings one qiraat according to the view favoured by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar, but it is less than the reward of one who attended from time the deceased was brought out of his house, until the funeral prayer is offered for him. 
4 – Attending the burial only, without offering the funeral prayer. The apparent meaning of the hadeeth is that there is no qiraat in this case, but a person will be rewarded in accordance with his actions. 
5 – Following the funeral procession for a while, then leaving, without attending the prayer or the burial. There is the hope that a person will be rewarded in accordance with his intention in this case.

67884,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67884,The hadeeth: “Conceal the engagement and proclaim the marriage”,"Is it forbidden for muslims to declare the engagement (alkhotoba)? If yes, who are the people supposed to know about the engagement?
Are Close friends allowed to know about it??.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This hadeeth was narrated by al-Daylami in Musnad al-Firdaws, where it says: “Announce the marriage and conceal the engagement.” This is a da’eef (weak) hadeeth which was classed as such by al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah (2494), and in Da’eef al-Jaami’ al-Sagheer, 922. 
But the first part of it is saheeh with the word “proclaim.”  
Ahmad narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Zubayr (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Proclaim marriages.” This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 1993. 
Proclaiming marriages, in the sense of announcing them and publicizing them, is obligatory according to the majority of scholars, indeed it is one of the conditions of a marriage being valid, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no marriage except with a wali (guardian) and two witnesses of good character.” Narrated by al-Bayhaqi from ‘Imraan and ‘Aa’ishah; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 7557. 
Some scholars regarded it as mustahabb to conceal the engagement for fear of hasad (destructive envy) which could lead to trouble between the man and the family of his fiancée, as stated in Haashiyat al-‘Adawi ‘ala Sharh Mukhtasar Khaleel, 3/167. 
This is supported by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Seek help in meeting your needs by keeping quiet, for everyone who is blessed is envied.” Narrated by al-Tabaraani; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 943. 
This does not apply only to engagement, rather a person should not show openly the blessings that Allaah has bestowed upon him to one who will envy him for that. 
With regard to holding engagement parties, this is something that many people do, and there is nothing wrong with that in sha Allaah. But it should be noted that we must adhere to the limits set by sharee’ah in these parties, so there should be no free mixing of men and women, or use of musical instruments apart from the daff, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) allowed use of the daff in wedding parties.

67886,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67886,She vowed to give all her wealth in charity but she owes zakaah. What should she do?,"A woman got sick and vowed to give all her jewellery in charity if Allaah healed her. After she recovered, she regretted it and now she is asking: Is there any expiation for this vow? If she must fulfil this vow, she owes eight years worth of zakaah on this jewellery. Does she have to pay zakaah for each year, and is that from the jewellery itself or what?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 
Vows are not prescribed 
    in Islam because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) forbade them. ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) 
    narrated: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    forbade vows and said: “They do not ward off anything, but they are a means 
    of getting something out of the miser.” Agreed upon; this version was 
    narrated by al-Bukhaari. So every Muslim, man or woman, should keep away 
    from vows and not commit himself to something that he may be unable to do or 
    find it very difficult to do, thus falling into sin. 

    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 
    23/362 

    Although vows are basically makrooh, the person who vows to 
    do an act of worship is obliged to fulfil it, because the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever vows to do an act 
    of worship, let him do it, and whoever vows to commit an act of sin let him 
    not do it.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6202 

    Secondly: 

    Vowing to give some of one's wealth in charity is a vow to do 
    an act of worship, so it is obligatory to fulfil it. 

    If a woman vows to give all her jewellery in charity, one of 
    the following two scenarios must apply: 

    1 – This jewellery is her entire wealth, in which case it is 
    sufficient for her to give one-third of it. This is the view of Ahmad (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him). 

    Some of the scholars are of the view that it is obligatory 
    for her to give all her wealth in charity, such as al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him). 

    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    Whoever vows to give all his wealth in charity, it is 
    sufficient for him to give one-third of it. This is the view of al-Zuhri and 
    Maalik… Abu Haneefah said: He should give all of his wealth that is subject 
    to zakaah… 

    Al-Shaafa’i said: He should give all his wealth in charity, 
    because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Whoever vows to obey Allaah, let him obey Him.” And because it is a vow to 
    do an act of worship, so it is obligatory for him to fulfil it, like a vow 
    to offer prayers or observe fasts. 

    The fact that it is sufficient to give one-third in charity 
    is indicated by the words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) in a hadeeth according to which Abu Lubaabah said:  “As a sign 
    of repentance I will give my wealth in charity for Allaah and His Messenger. 
    (The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) said: 
    “One-third is sufficient.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Takhreej 
    Ahaadeeth Mishkaat al-Masaabih, 3439. 

    It was narrated that Ka’b ibn Maalik said: I said, “O 
    Messenger of Allaah, as a sign of my repentance, I will give up my wealth in 
    charity for Allaah and His Messenger.” The Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Keep part of your wealth for 
    yourself.” Agreed upon. According to a version narrated by Abu Dawood, “One 
    third is sufficient.” [Al-Albaani said in Saheeh Abi Dawood (3319):

i.e., if the wealth 
    specified in a vow refers to all of one's wealth, the ruling is the same as 
    the ruling on one who vows to give all his wealth in charity; it is 
    sufficient for him to give one-third. 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in al-Fataawa al-Kubra 
    (6/188): 

    Concerning a person who vows to give all his wealth in 
    charity, the Sunnah is that it is sufficient for him to give one-third, 
    because giving all of it would cause hardship. End quote. 

    Ibn al-Qayyim said something similar in I’laam 
    al-Muwaqqi’een, 3/165 

    The correct view is that of the Hanafis, as stated in a fatwa 
    by the Standing Committee, when asked about one who vowed to give his entire 
    salary for the sake of Allaah on an ongoing basis. They replied: It is 
    sufficient for you to give one-third of your salary, because the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to one who vowed to 
    give all his wealth in charity: “One third is sufficient.” Narrated by Abu 
    Dawood.

    2 – She has other wealth besides the jewellery, in which case 
    she must give all her jewellery in charity as she vowed to do. Ibn Qudaamah 
    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If a person vows to give a specific 
    thing or a specific amount of his wealth in charity, such as one thousand, 
    it is narrated from Ahmad that it is permissible to give one-third, because 
    it is wealth that he vowed to give in charity, so one-third is sufficient, 
    as is the case when giving all of one's wealth. But the correct view 
    according to our madhhab is that all of it must be given in charity, because 
    it is a vow and an act of worship, so it must be fulfilled, as with all 
    other vows, because of the general meaning of the verse in which Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning):   “They (are those who) fulfil (their) 
    vows…” [al-Insaan 76:7]. 

    The reason why the fatwa is different with regard to one who 
    vow to give all of his wealth is because of the report narrated from the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and 
    because giving all of one’s wealth in charity could cause harm to a person.
    al-Mughni, 11/340 

    Thirdly: 
With regard to zakaah on 
    jewellery, she has to pay the zakaah for those eight years, regardless of 
    whether we say that she as to give all of her jewellery in charity or only 
    one-third of it – according to the discussion above – because zakaah is a 
    debt that she must pay, and it has nothing to do with the vow. But if she 
    has to give all the jewellery in charity, then she should pay the zakaah 
    from her other wealth, and she does not have to pay the zakaah from the 
    jewellery itself.

     If she has to give one-third of it in charity, then it is 
    permissible for her to pay the zakaah from the remaining jewellery, if that 
    is possible, or from her other wealth.",Islam Q&A

I was surprised when one of my friends did not fast on the thirtieth day. He said to me that it is haraam to fast on this day because the moon has appeared in Saudi.

 My question is: what is the ruling on what my friend did?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If a Muslim is in a country that relies on moonsighting to 
    determine the beginning and end of the month, then he is enjoined to start 
    and end the fast when they do. We have stated that in the answer to question 
    no. 12660. 

    But if the Muslim is in a kaafir land, or in a land where 
    they tinker with the beginning and end of the month according to their whims 
    and desires, and do not pay attention to the moonsighting as prescribed in 
    Islam, then there is no sin on him if he follows those whose moonsighting 
    and adherence to Islamic rulings he trusts. See the answer to question no.

If she is going from one house to another, where no non-Mahram will see her, then there is nothing wrong with her wearing kohl in that case.","Should women cover their beauty and adornment before non-Mahram men?


Is covering the face obligatory?


Why shouldn’t women show their adornment?


Can women wear kohl when they go out?","Praise be to Allah.Should women cover their beauty and adornment before non-Mahram men?
Every believing woman is obliged to cover her beauty and adornment before non-Mahram men, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent (like both eyes for necessity to see the way, or outer palms of hands or one eye or dress like veil, gloves, headcover, apron), and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms) and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband’s fathers, or their sons, or their husband’s sons, or their brothers or their brother’s sons, or their sister’s sons, or their (Muslim) women (i.e. their sisters in Islam), or the (female) slaves whom their right hands possess, or old male servants who lack vigour, or small children who have no sense of feminine sex. And let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment. And all of you beg Allah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful” [An-Nur 24:31]
Adornment includes kohl , makeup, jewellery, etc. 
With regard to the words at the beginning of the verse – “And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent” – what is meant by “that which is apparent” is the clothing, `Abayah (outer garment) and headcover, and whatever appears unintentionally, because of the wind, for example. 
Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“This means she should not show anything of her adornment to non-Mahrams, apart from that which cannot be hidden. Ibn Mas`ud said: Such as the Rida ‘ (cloak) and clothes, i.e., what the Arab women used to wear of a Miqna` (a kind of outer garment) and what appears below from the garment. There is no sin in that, because this is something that cannot be hidden. That is like what appears of a woman’s lower garment, and what cannot be hidden.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 3/274) 
Is covering the face obligatory?
Some of the scholars interpreted the external adornment as referring to the face and hands, but that is a less correct view, because there is a great deal of evidence that shows that it is obligatory for a woman to cover her face .
The scholar Muhammad Al-Amin Ash-Shanqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“The more correct of the two views in my opinion is the view of Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him), that the external adornment is that which when one looks at it, one cannot see any part of the woman’s body. We say that this view is more correct because it is the most cautious view, and is farthest removed from causes of Fitnah (temptation), and is purest for the hearts of men and women. It is obvious that a woman’s face is the focus of her beauty, and seeing it is one of the greatest means of temptation. As is well known in Shari`ah, this is the best means of avoiding falling into something prohibited.” (Adwa’ Al-Bayan, 6/200) 
The basic principle is that a woman should cover her entire face, but it is permissible for her to uncover her eyes so that she may see, subject to the condition that showing her eyes will not lead to any Fitnah due to her wearing kohl or having wide openings in her Niqab (face cover). 
The evidence for this concession in wearing Niqab and uncovering the eyes is the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (1838) from `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A woman in Ihram should not wear Niqab or wear gloves.” This indicates that it is permissible for women who are not in Ihram for Hajj or `Umrah to wear niqab . 
Abu `Ubayd said, describing the Niqab that was worn by the Arabs: “It is that which shows the eye-socket; they used to call it al-waswasah and al-burqa’.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 17/171) 
Why shouldn’t women show their adornment?
The reason why it is prohibited to show this adornment is so as to protect women’s chastity and honour, and to close the door to temptation and prevent her being tempted or tempting others. Those who are sick at heart may have hopes concerning those who show their adornment, but they will leave the one who is modest and covered alone. 
Islam closes the doors that lead to men being tempted by women and vice versa. Islam enjoins lowering the gaze and forbids wanton display, free mixing and being alone with women. Women are warned against going out wearing perfume or travelling without a Mahram. This is reflective of the perfection of Islam, for men by nature are affected by women, and if this is not prevented then there will be much Fitnah (temptation and tribulation), and corruption will become widespread, as we can see in societies that have neglected the guidelines and rulings of the Shari`ah. 
Can women wear kohl when they go out?
It says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (17/128): Many women in Egypt put kohl on their eyes, and if I tell them that wearing it for adornment is prohibited, they say that it is Sunnah. Is that true? 
Answer:
“Using kohl is prescribed in Islam , but it is not permissible for a woman to show any of her adornment, whether that is kohl or anything else, to anyone other than her husband or Mahrams. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands…” 
In conclusion, it is not permissible for a woman to wear kohl in front of non-Mahram men, because it comes under the heading of adornment which she is required to conceal. If she is going from one house to another, where no non-Mahram will see her, then there is nothing wrong with her wearing kohl in that case.
