34215,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34215,Ruling on facial peeling,"What is the ruling on facial peeling, i.e., removing the external layer of facial skin?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Facial peeling is a kind of cosmetic surgery that is done by 
    some people with the aim of looking younger, i.e., to remove signs of 
    aging. 

    This kind of surgery is not essential, and the patient will 
    not suffer any hardship if he or she does not do it. Rather the aim is to 
    change the creation of Allaah and to play about with it according to 
    people’s whims and desires. Thus it is haraam and it is not permissible to 
    do it, for the following reasons: 

    1 – Allaah tells us that Iblees (may Allaah curse him) said: 

    “and indeed I will order them to change the nature created 
    by Allaah”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:119]

    This verse indicates that changing the creation of Allaah is 
    one of the haraam things that the Shaytaan tempts the sinners among the sons 
    of Adam to do. 

    2 – Al-Bukhaari (5931) and Muslim (2125) narrated that 
    ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “May Allaah 
    curse the women who do tattoos and those who have them done, those who have 
    their eyebrows plucked, and those who file their teeth for the purpose of 
    beautification and change the creation of Allaah.” Then ‘Abd-Allaah said: 
    “Why should I not curse those whom the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed.” See question no.
    21119 

    The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) cursed those who do these things and he gave the reason for 
    that as being that they change the creation of Allaah. He made a connection 
    between changing the creation of Allaah and seeking to beautify oneself. 
    These two factors are both to be found in the case of facial peeling, 
    because it is changing the creation of Allaah with the intention of making 
    oneself more beautiful, so it is to be regarded as being included in this 
    stern warning – i.e., the curse of Allaah – so it is not permissible to do 
    that. 
Some people make excuses 
    and try to come up with a reason to make such operations permissible – that 
    the person suffers psychologically and cannot achieve his aims and goals in 
    this world because his beauty is imperfect. The way to deal with such 
    fanciful notions is to instill faith in people’s hearts and teach them to 
    accept whatever share of physical beauty Allaah has decreed for them. 
    Outward appearance is not the means to achieve noble aims and goals. Rather 
    they may be achieved by the help of Allaah, then by following His laws and 
    having a good attitude and decent manners.

34217,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34217,Mobile phones making haraam sounds,What is your opinion of what we hear of the annoying ringing of mobile phones with a musical ring and their being so popular that they are even heard in the mosques?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Setting mobile phones to ring with a musical 
    tone is reprehensible and haraam, and it is even worse and more haraam if that happens in the houses of Allaah, namely the mosques, because that 
    is openly committing falsehood and haraam in that place, so the sin of the one who brings it with him is even worse in the mosque. It is known 
    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stated that musical instruments are haraam, meaning the instruments that give 
    these musical sounds. These mobile phones have these sounds recorded in them which is repeated every time a call comes to the owner of the phone.  
    I wonder what will be recorded in the record of deeds of those who make their mobile phones play music in the houses of Allaah during the prayer, 
    and disturb themselves and others, and make the voice of falsehood and the musical instruments of the Shaytaan echo loudly in the houses of 
    Allaah.  
Do they not fear their Lord and repent to Him 
    and give up what they are doing and change this evil, especially when there is a permissible alternative in the other regular, non-musical sounds 
    that they can choose for the phone’s ring? 
We should note that the ringing of the 
    telephone, even if it is a permissible sound, should still be turned off before entering the mosque, so that it will not disturb the worshippers. 
And Allaah is the One Whose help we seek and 
    to whom we complain. There is no power and no strength except with Allaah.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
34219,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34219,Passing the meeqaat without entering ihram for one who intends to do Hajj and ‘Umrah,"A man came from his country to Jeddah, intending to do Hajj and ‘Umrah, but he did not enter ihram from the meeqaat, rather he entered ihram in the airport at Jeddah. What is the ruling?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) specified particular places for ihram, from which the person who wants to do Hajj or ‘Umrah has to enter ihram, and it is not permissible to pass them until he enters ihram, because passing them before entering ihram is transgressing one of the limits of Allah, and Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whoever transgresses the limits ordained by Allah, then such are the Zaalimoon (wrongdoers)”
[al-Baqarah 2:229] 
“And whosoever transgresses the set limits of Allah, then indeed he has wronged himself”
[al-Talaaq 65:1]
In al-Saheehayn and elsewhere it is narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) defined the meeqaat of the people of Madeenah as Dhu’l-Hulayfah; that of the people of Shaam (Syria) as al-Jahfah; that of the people of Najd as Qarn al-Manaazil; and that of the people of Yemen as Yalamlam. And he said: “And these meeqaats are for the people at those very places, and besides them for those who come thorough those places with the intention of performing Hajj and 'Umrah; and whoever is living within these boundaries can enter Ihram from the place he starts” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1524; Muslim, 1181. 
It is also narrated in al-Saheehayn from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The meeqaat for the people of Madeenah is Dhu’l-Hulayfah.” Narrated by Muslim, 1183. This is a statement which is in fact a command, but it appears in the form of a statement to emphasize that this is the way in which it should be done. 
It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) defined the meeqaat of the people of Iraq as Dhaat ‘Irq. Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1739; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 1531. 
In Saheeh al-Bukhaari (1531) it is narrated that the people of Kufa and Basra came to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) and said, “O Ameer al-Mu’mineen, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated that Qarn was the meeqaat for the people of Najd, but it is out of our way, and if we want to go to Qarn it is difficult for us. He said: “Take as your meeqaat a place that is parallel with Qarn on your usual route.”  
So the one who intends to do Hajj or ‘Umrah must enter ihram from these meeqaats when he comes to them, whether he comes by land or sea or air. 
If he is coming by land he should stop there when he passes through if it is on his route, or he should stop at a place that is parallel with it if it is not on his route, and do what is required when entering ihram, namely doing ghusl, perfuming his body and putting on the ihram garments, then he should enter ihram before leaving the place. 
If he is coming by sea and if the ship will stop when it is parallel with the meeqaat, he should do ghusl, put on perfume and put on the ihram garments when it stops, then he should enter ihram before it moves on. If it does not stop when it comes in line with the meeqaat, then he should do ghusl, put on perfume and put on the ihram garments before it comes in line with the meeqaat, and enter into ihram when it comes in line with it. 
If he is coming by air, he should do ghusl before getting on board the plane, and put on perfume and the ihram garments before the plane comes in line with the meeqaat, then he should enter into ihram just before it comes in line with the meeqaat; he should not wait until it is in line with it, because planes travel quickly and he will not have the opportunity, so if he enters ihram before to be on the safe side, there is nothing wrong with that.",From Daleel al-Akhta’ allati yaqa’ fiha al-Haaj wa’l-Mu’tamir

    case you should tell her and seek her forgiveness for backbiting about her. If she has heard what you said about her, then you have to apologize 
    to her and ask her to forgive you. If she did not hear of what you said about her, then do not tell her, rather make a lot of du’aa’ for her, pray 
    for forgiveness, and speak well of her and mention her good points to those to whom you spoke about her. We ask Allaah to forgive us and you.

With regard to the problem of your brother’s 
    doubts about your behaviour, this may be solved by asking Allaah to guide him and to make him stop that. Then you should adhere to Allaah’s 
    command of hijab, lowering the gaze, and avoiding non-mahram men. Do a lot of naafil prayers and fasts, and give in charity. Try to speak to him 
    frankly and warn him against being suspicious of you.

    righteous he will no longer doubt you, and that suspicion will disappear from his heart, in sha Allaah.

34234,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34234,He claims that the Qur’aan is lacking in eloquence and contains grammatical errors,"In Soorat al-Baqarah it says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And indeed, We gave Moosa (Moses) the Book and followed him up with a succession of Messengers. And We gave ‘Eesa (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), clear signs and supported him with Rooh-ul-Qudus [Jibreel (Gabriel)]. Is it that whenever there came to you a Messenger with what you yourselves desired not, you grew arrogant? Some you disbelieved and some you killed”

[al-Baqarah 2:87] 

My Christian colleague says, look at the way the word taqtuloon (translated as “you killed” – appears in present tense form) follows the word kadhdhabtum (“you disbelieved” – past tense). He says that the wording should be [Allaah forbid that we should alter His Holy Book] fa fareeqan kadhdhabtum wa fareeqan qataltum (Some you disbelieved and some you killed) [i.e., both verbs appearing in past tense form], because the Prophets have ceased and Muhammad was the Seal of the Prophets. It should be noted that he does not believe that the Prophet Muhammad was a Prophet, rather he believes that Prophet ‘Eesa (Jesus) was the last of the Messengers. 

In Soorat Aal ‘Imraan it says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“When He has decreed something, He says to it only: ‘Be!’__and it is [kun fa yakoon]”

[Aal ‘Imraan 3:47] 

My Christian colleague also thinks that this is ineloquent and he says that it would be more correct [Allaah forbid that we should alter His Holy Book] to say Kun fa kaana (Be and it was).  

Please explain so that I can refute his comments. “So ask the people of the Reminder if you do not know” [al-Anbiya 21:7 – interpretation of the meaning].",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The one who is not able to engage in debate 
    with others should fear Allaah and not get involved in debates and arguments with others; rather he should try to protect his religious commitment 
    by refraining from arguing with the ignorant or those who promote specious arguments.  
Secondly: 
With regard to the specious arguments 
    mentioned – which are more flimsy than a spider’s web – these may be answered in two ways. 
The first way is in general terms, which is 
    to say that the Qur’aan is the Book of Allaah which was revealed to the pure Arabs, who were the most advanced nation in the field of eloquence; 
    they paid a great deal of attention to that and had reached a high level of eloquent self-expression. They had established festivals of poetry and 
    speech-giving, they hung their mu’allaqaat poems on the Ka’bah as a sign of the high esteem in which they held eloquence and literature; they 
    competed in poetry and beautiful speech. Poetry flowed through their veins and they recited poems on all occasions, for joy and sorrow, birth and 
    death, happiness and misery, victory and defeat. This was something that was unknown in any other nation. 
Hence by His wisdom Allaah revealed to them 
    this Qur’aan in this language of which they were so proud and because of which they thought themselves superior to other nations. The Qur’aan 
    dazzled them with its beautiful words and meanings, its great purpose and structure. So they submitted to it out of respect for its language and 
    dare not speak any word of criticism against its wording, grammar or expression.  
Allaah challenged them in His Book to produce 
    anything like the Qur’aan, but they could not match it, let alone find fault with its grammar. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say: ‘If the mankind and the jinn were 
    together to produce the like of this Qur’aan, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another’”
    [al-Isra’ 17:88]
Then Allaah challenged them to produced ten 
    soorahs like it, as He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Or they say, ‘He (Prophet Muhammad) 
    forged it (the Qur’aan).’ Say: ‘Bring you then ten forged Soorah (chapters) like unto it, and call whomsoever you can, other than Allaah (to your 
    help), if you speak the truth!’”
[Hood 11:13]
When they were unable to do that, then Allaah 
    challenged them to produce just one soorah like it. Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and 
    Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. the Qur’aan) to Our slave (Muhammad), then produce a Soorah (chapter) of 
    the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allaah, if you are truthful”
[al-Baqarah 2:23]
No one who comes afterwards, when the 
    language has become corrupted and mixed with foreign languages, has any right to support such nonsensical ideas that do no more than point to the 
    depth of his ignorance and the shallowness of his thinking, and his lack of knowledge of the Arabic language. As it was said,  
“How often do you see someone criticizing 
    something that is sound, and his problem is that he cannot understand it properly.” 
The second way is in specific, detailed 
    terms, discussing the aspects of eloquence in the words that he criticized. This is as follows: 
With regard to the words of Allaah 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Some you disbelieved and some you killed 
    (fafareeqan kadhdhabtum wa fareeqan taqtuloon)”
[al-Baqarah 2:87]
The scholar al-Taahir ibn ‘Ashoor said in his 
    commentary (al-Tahreer wa’l-Tanweer, 1/598): 
The word taqtuloon (translated as “you 
    killed”) appears in the present tense form to emphasize more vividly the terrible action that they did, namely killing the Prophets. This is like 
    the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And it is Allaah Who sends [arsala – part 
    tense form] the winds, so that they raise up [fa tutheeru – present tense form] the clouds, and We drive them to a dead land, and revive therewith 
    the earth after its death”
[Faatir 35:9]
Moreover, the form taqtuloon fits with 
    the rhyme of the soorah and makes it more vivid; this provides eloquence of meaning and beauty of form. End of quote. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen quoted in his 
    Tasfeer (1/283) from some of the scholars another reason for using the present tense form taqtuloon, which is to provide a sense of 
    continuity, i.e., the Jews kept on killing the Prophets, even the last of them, Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). They 
    killed the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with the poison that they gave him at Khaybar, and he  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) continued to suffer the effects of that until, in his final illness, he said, “I still feel pain from the food I 
    ate at Khaybar. This is the time when it has cut off my aorta.” 
Abu Dawood; also narrated by al-Bukhaari in a 
    mu’allaq report. Al-Albaani said in Saheeh Abi Dawood (3784), it is hasan saheeh. 
With regard to the verse in which Allaah says 
     
(interpretation of the meaning):
“When 
    He has decreed something, He says to it only: ‘Be!’ __and 
    it is [kun fa yakoon]”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:47]
This is more indicative of the ignorance of 
    this objector, because this verse is speaking of when Allaah wills to create something in the future, not in the past; this is to be understood 
    from the use of the word idha (meaning when, if), which refers to something in the future. Hence the verb yaqool (says) appears in 
    the present tense, to indicate that it is referring to something in the future, and it is followed by the verb yakoon (it is), also in the 
    present tense, which also refers to something in the future.

1- They enter ihraam for Hajj from al-Masjid al-Haraam
2- They do not put on the ihraam garments that they wore for ‘Umrah. 
Is this correct or not?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This is one of the mistakes that are made when entering ihraam for Hajj. We will deal with it in some detail. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Some of the mistakes made when entering ihraam for Hajj on the day of al-tarwiyah include the following:
-1- 
Some people think that they have to enter ihraam from al-Masjid al-Haraam, so you see them putting themselves through hardship to go to the mosque and enter ihraam from there. This is a mistaken notion, because it is not obligatory to enter ihraam from al-Masjid al-Haraam. Rather the Sunnah is for the pilgrim to enter ihraam from the place where he is staying, because the Sahaabah who had exited ihraam for ‘Umrah by the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) then entered ihraam for Hajj on the day of al-Tarwiyah, did not go to al-Masjid al-Haraam to enter ihraam from there, rather each one of them entered ihraam from the place where he was staying. This was at the time of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so this is the Sunnah. So the Sunnah for the one who wants to enter ihraam for Hajj is to enter ihraam from the place where he is staying, whether he is in Makkah or in Mina, as some people do nowadays, when they go to Mina so that they can keep their places there.
 Secondly: 
Some of the pilgrims think that it is not proper to enter ihraam in the garments that they wore when they entered ihraam for ‘Umrah, unless they wash them first. This is also a mistaken notion, because the ihraam garments do not have to be new or clean. It is true that the cleaner they are, the better, but to say that they are not valid for ihraam because one has worn them for ihraam when performing ‘Umrah is not correct. This is what springs to mind now about the mistakes made by some pilgrims with regard to entering ihraam for Hajj.",From Daleel al-Akhta’ allati yaqa’u fiha al-Haaj wa’l-Mu’tamir
34293,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34293,Mistakes made when going to ‘Arafah and in ‘Arafah itself,What are the mistakes that some of the pilgrims make on the day of ‘Arafah?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
It was narrated that on the day of ‘Arafah the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stayed in Namirah (which is a place near ‘Arafah) until the sun had passed its zenith (which is the beginning of the time  for Zuhr), then he rode, then he stopped at the bottom of Wadi ‘Arnah (which is a wadi or valley between Namirah and ‘Arafaat), where he prayed Zuhr and ‘Asr, shortening them to two rak’ahs and joining them together at the time of Zuhr, with one adhaan and two iqaamahs. Then he rode on until he came to the place of standing, and stood there. He said, “I am standing here but all of ‘Arafah is the place of standing.” Then he remained standing, facing the qiblah, raising his hands, remembering Allaah and calling upon Him, until the sun had set completely, then he went on to Muzdalifah. 
Some of the mistakes that some pilgrims make in ‘Arafah are as follows:
 -1- 
Some pilgrims pass you and you do not hear them reciting the Talbiyah. They do not recite the Talbiyah out loud on their way from Mina to ‘Arafah. It was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) continued to recite the Talbiyah until he had stoned Jamarat al-‘Aqabah on the day of Eid. 
-2-
 One of the most serious mistakes that some pilgrims make is to stop outside ‘Arafah, and they stay there until the sun goes down, then they leave for Muzdalifah. Those who stand in these places have not performed Hajj, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Hajj is ‘Arafah.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (889) and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 1064). Whoever does not stand in ‘Arafah in a place that is part of it, and at the time specified for the standing, his Hajj is not valid, because of the hadeeth referred to. This is a serious matter. 
There are markers that clearly indicate the boundaries of ‘Arafah, and they are not hidden except for one who is careless and negligent. Every pilgrim must look for the boundaries so that he will be sure that he is standing in ‘Arafah and not outside it. 
I wish that those who organize the Hajj would announce to the people via a means that would reach all of them, in numerous languages, and tell the mutawwifeen (Hajj guides) to warn the pilgrims about that, so that the people would be aware of this issue and perform their Hajj in the proper manner. 
-3- 
Some people busy themselves with du’aa’ at the end of the day, so you see them facing towards the mountain by which the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood, even though the qiblah may be behind them or to their right or their left. This is also ignorance and a mistake. What is prescribed for du’aa’ on the day of ‘Arafah is for the person to face the qiblah, whether the mountain is in front of him or behind him, or to his right or his left. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) only faced this mountain because the place where he stood was behind the mountain. He (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) faced towards the qiblah, and because the mountain was between him and the qiblah, he had not choice but to face it too. 
-4-  
Some people think that they have to go to the place where the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood, beside the mountain, and stand there. So you see them putting themselves through a great deal of trouble to reach that place. They may be walking and may be unfamiliar with the routes and getting hungry and thirsty if they cannot find food and water, and getting lost, and suffering a great deal of harm because of this mistaken notion. It was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “I am standing here but all of ‘Arafah is the place of standing.” 
It is as if the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was pointing out that no one should go to the trouble of standing in the place where the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood, rather people should do what is easy for them, because all of ‘Arafah is the place of standing. 
-5- 
Some people think that the trees in ‘Arafaah are like the trees in Mina and Muzdalifah, i.e., it is not permissible to cut a leaf or branch from them, and so on, because they think that cutting the trees has to do with ihraam, like hunting. This is a mistaken notion, because cutting trees has nothing to do with ihraam, rather it has to do with the place. Whatever trees are within the boundaries of the Haram are sacrosanct, and should not be cut and no leaves or branches may be cut from them. Whatever is outside the boundaries of the Haram may be cut, even if a person is in ihraam. Based on this there is nothing wrong with cutting the trees in ‘Arafaah… (With regard to trees that have been planted by people, they are not covered by the prohibition on cutting the trees in the Haram, but it may be haraam to cut them for another reason, namely transgressing the rights of the people who planted them, and transgressing the rights of the pilgrims too, if these trees were planted to reduce the heat and to shade people from the sun. 
Based on this, it is not permissible to cut the trees that are planted in ‘Arafah, not because of the Haram, but because cutting them is a transgression of the rights of all the Muslims). 
-6-
 Some pilgrims think that the mountain by which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood is holy and special, so they go to it and climb up it, and seek blessings from its stones and soil. They hang pieces of cloth from its trees, and do other things that are well known. These are innovations (bid’ah). It is not prescribed to climb the mountain or to pray there, or to hang pieces of cloth on its trees, because none of that was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Indeed, such things smack of idolatry, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) passed by a tree of the mushrikeen on which they used to hang their weapons, and those who were with him said, “O Messenger of Allaah, make for us a Dhaat Anwaat [the name of the tree] like their Dhaat Anwaat.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Allaahu akbar! These are traditions and you are following the traditions of those who came before you. By the One in Whose hand is my soul, you have spoken as the Children of Israel spoke to Moosa: ‘Make us a god as they have gods.’” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2180; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Sunnah li Ibn Abi ‘Aasim. 
This mountain is not holy, rather it is like any other hills in ‘Arafah, and the valley in it. But the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood there, so it is prescribed to stand where the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood, if possible, but it is not obligatory, so no one has to make things difficult for himself by going there, for the reasons explained above. 
-7- 
Some people think that it is essential to pray Zuhr and ‘Asr with the imam in the mosque, hence you see them going to that place from far away so that they can be with the imam in the mosque. This causes them a great deal of difficulty and many of them lose their way, which makes Hajj too hard for them, and they crowd one another and upset one another. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said concerning the standing, “I am standing here, but all of ‘Arafah is the place of standing.” And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also said: “The earth has been made a mosque (place of prayer) and a means of purification for me.” So if a person prays in his tent in a calm and dignified manner, without being disturbed or disturbing others, and without trouble that makes Hajj too hard, that is better.

Some of them leave ‘Arafah before the sun sets, and go to Muzdalifah. This is a serious mistake, and is acting like the mushrikeen who used to leave ‘Arafah before sunset. It is also going against the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) who did not leave ‘Arafah until after the sun had set and the yellow afterglow had diminished somewhat, as it says in the hadeeth of Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him). 
Based on this, pilgrims have to stay in ‘Arafah, within its boundaries, until the sun sets, because this standing lasts until the sun sets; just as it is not permissible for a person who is fasting to break his fast before sunset, so it is not permissible for the one who is standing in ‘Arafah to leave before the sun sets.

Wasting time in matters that are of no benefit. So you see people from the beginning of the day until the end engaged in conversations that may be innocent and free of gossip, or it may not be such, because they are slandering people’s honour and eating their flesh. If it is the latter then they are combining two haraam actions: 
1-Eating people’s flesh and backbiting about them. This is a violation of the conditions of ihraam, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“So whosoever intends to perform Hajj therein (by assuming Ihraam), then he should not have sexual relations (with his wife), nor commit sin, nor dispute unjustly during the Hajj”
[al-Baqarah 2:197]
2-Wasting time
Even if the talk is innocent and does not include anything haraam, it is still a waste of time, but there is nothing wrong with a person passing the time in innocent conversation before the sun reaches its zenith. But after the sun has passed its zenith and the people have prayed Zuhr and ‘Asr, it is better to occupy oneself with du’aa’, dhikr and reading Qur’aan, and speaking beneficial words to one’s brothers for a break from reading and dhikr. So he can say some useful words to them about some Islamic knowledge etc., that will make them feel happy, and give them hope of the mercy of Allaah. But he should make the most of the opportunity at the end of the day and occupy himself with du’aa’, beseeching Allaah and seeking His bounty and mercy, and persist in making du’aa’, and make of lot of du’aa’ in the words narrated in the Qur’aan and saheeh Sunnah, for these are the best of du’aa’s, and du’aa’s offered at this time are more likely to be answered.",Reference: Daleel al-Akhta’ allati yaqa’a fiha al-Haaj wa’l-Mu’tamir (mistakes made by pilgrims performing Hajj and ‘Umrah)
34295,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34295,Why do people not respond to the laws of Allaah?,"Allaah has revealed religions and sent the Messengers to set mankind’s affairs straight, because these laws bring goodness, righteousness, happiness and justice etc. But in fact we do not see these laws achieving these aims except in a few short periods of history.

 My question is, how can the religious believe in these values which are like a mirage that did not exist on earth except at the time of the Prophets and the Sahaabah? I really hope that you can answer this question that is bothering me.",,,"Praise be to Allah.First of all we want to remind you of an 
    important point, advice which was given by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah to his student Ibn al-Qayyim, as it says in Miftaah Daar al-Sa’aadah, 
    1/140. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Shaykh al-Islam (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) said to me – when I started to ask him one question after another –  
“Do not make your heart like a sponge soaking 
    up any idea and specious arguments that come to mind, rather make it like a glass through whose surface the specious arguments pass but do not 
    settle there, otherwise if all those doubts and specious arguments settle in your heart, it will be overwhelmed by them.”  I do not think that I 
    have ever benefited from any advice on how to deal with doubts and specious arguments as much as I benefited from this. 
Know, may Allaah bless you, that the purpose 
    behind the sending of the Messengers was to guide mankind to the worship of Allaah, so that proof may be established against His slaves. The 
    Prophets of Allaah were not charged with the task of instilling faith in people’s hearts, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“You are only a warner, and to every 
    people there is a guide”
[al-Ra’d 13:7] 
“Say (O Muhammad): I am only a warner and 
    there is no Ilaah (God) except Allaah (none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah) the One, the Irresistible”
[Sad 38:65] 
“Verily, this is an admonition, therefore 
    whosoever will, let him take a Path to His Lord!”
[al-Muzzammil 73:19] 
“And say: ‘The truth is from your Lord.’ 
    Then whosoever wills, let him believe; and whosoever wills, let him disbelieve”
[al-Kahf 18:29]
In Saheeh Muslim (2865) it is narrated 
    from ‘Iyaad ibn Himaar al-Mujaashi’i that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said one day in his khutbah: 
“My Lord has commanded me to teach you 
    something of which you are unaware, that He has taught me today…: ‘I created all My slaves as haneefs (pure monotheists), but the devils came to 
    them and turned them away from their religion, and forbade them that which I permitted them and commanded them to associate with Me others with no 
    authority from Allaah.  Allaah looked at the people of the earth and despised them, Arabs and non-Arabs, except a few left over from the People of 
    the Book. And He said, ‘I have only sent you in order to test you and test (others) by means of you.” 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It may be that you (O Muhammad) are going 
    to kill yourself with grief, that they do not become believers”
[al-Shu’ara 26:3]
And Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“And had your Lord willed, those on earth 
    would have believed, all of them together. So, will you (O Muhammad) then compel mankind, until they become believers”
[Yoonus 10:99] 
“And most of mankind will not believe even 
    if you desire it eagerly”
[Yoosuf 12:103]
Allaah has decreed that some of the sons of 
    Adam will be believers and some will be kaafirs. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He it is Who created you, then some of 
    you are disbelievers and some of you are believers. And Allaah is All-Seer of what you do”
[al-Taghaabun 64:2]
It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri 
    said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah will say on the Day of Resurrection: ‘O Adam!’ He will say, ‘Here 
    I am, our Lord.’ Then a voice will call out: ‘Allaah commands you to bring forth those of your offspring who are to be sent to Hell.’ He will say, 
    ‘O Lord, who are those who are to be sent to Hell?’ He will say, ‘From every thousand, nine hundred and ninety nine.’” That affected the people so 
    much that their expressions changed. Then the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “From Ya’jooj and Ma’jooj nine 
    hundred and ninety nine, and from you one. Among the people you are like a black hair on the side of a white bull, or like a white hair on the 
    side of a black bull. I hope that you will be one-quarter of the people of Paradise.” We said, “Allaahu akbar!” Then he said, “One third of the 
    people of Paradise.” We said, “Allaahu akbar!” then he said, “Half of the people of Paradise.” And we said, “Allaahu akbar!” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4741; Muslim 222 
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) told us that Islam started as something strange, and it will go back to being strange as it started. Muslim narrated in his 
    Saheeh (no. 145) that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Islam started as 
    something strange and it will go back to being strange as it started, so give glad tidings to the strangers.” 
And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) spoke of the Prophets who came before him, whose followers were few, as it says in the hadeeth narrated by Muslim in his 
    Saheeh (no. 5705): It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The 
    nations were shown to me and one or two Prophets came past me with a small group, and a Prophet with no one with him. Then a great crowd was shown 
    to me and I said, ‘What is this? Is this my ummah?’ It was said, ‘No, this is Moosa and his people.’ Then it was said, ‘Look at the horizon,’ and 
    there I saw a (vast) crowd filling the horizon. Then it was said to me, ‘Look there and there on the horizon,’ and I saw a crowd that had filled 
    the horizon. It was said, ‘This is your ummah, and seventy thousand of them will enter Paradise without being bought to account.’” 
It should be noted that for values to be 
    sound, it is not essential for all the people to adhere to them. Most people, of all times, all classes and all languages – except for those on 
    whom Allaah has mercy – do not follow their better instincts, let alone the commands that Allaah has enjoined, and the fact that they do not 
    follow these laws does not mean that these laws are not good in and of themselves. 
The reason for that is that Allaah has 
    created the human soul, and made among its basic attributes ignorance and injustice, as Allaah says of man, and He knows best about him 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, 
    he was unjust (to himself) and ignorant (of its results)”
[al-Ahzaab 33:72]
This soul knowingly does things that harm it, 
    because of its inherent unjust and ignorant nature. 
For the Muslim who has submitted fully to 
    Allaah, Soorat al-‘Asr is enough, of which al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If Allaah had not revealed any soorah to His slaves 
    apart from this, that would have been sufficient for them. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“By Al-‘Asr (the time).
Verily, man is in loss,
Except those who believe (in Islamic 
    Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth [i.e. order one another to perform all kinds of good deeds 
    (Al-Ma‘roof) which Allaah has ordained, and abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds (Al-Munkar) which Allaah has forbidden], and recommend 
    one another to patience (for the sufferings, harms, and injuries which one may encounter in Allaah’s Cause during preaching His religion of 
    Islamic Monotheism or Jihad)”
[al-‘Asr 103:1-3]
Every kind of human being is in a state of 
    loss, apart from those who fulfil these conditions. 
We ask Allaah to make us among them and to 
    make us steadfast in following this path.",Islam Q&A
