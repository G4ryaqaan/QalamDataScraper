32706,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/32706,She said to her husband: “You are to me like my father”,"I had an argument with my husband, and at the moment of anger I declared that he was haraam to me and I said to him: “You are to me like my father, until the Day of Resurrection.” I repeated that several times. What should I do? Should I ask my husband for a divorce or what? I am confused about my situation.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If a Muslim declares 
    something to be haraam for himself that Allaah has permitted, this comes 
    under the same ruling as an oath (yameen). 

    The evidence for that is the verse in which Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which 
    Allaah has allowed to you, seeking to please your wives? And Allaah is 
    Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful.
2. Allaah has already 
    ordained for you (O men) the absolution from your oaths. And Allaah is your 
    Mawlaa (Lord, or Master, or Protector) and He is the All‑Knower, the 
    All‑Wise”

    [al-Tahreem 66:1-2]

    Al-Sa’di (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his 
    Tafseer (p. 1035): 

    This is a rebuke from Allaah to His Prophet Muhammad  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), when he declared that his 
    concubine Maryah and drinks of honey were forbidden to him, in order to 
    please some of his wives, as narrated in the well-known story, whereupon 
    Allaah revealed these verses.  

    The fact that he forbade these things to himself led to the 
    revelation of a general ruling which applies to the entire ummah. Allaah 
    said: “Allaah has already ordained for you (O men) the absolution from 
    your oaths”. This is general and applies to all oaths sworn by the 
    believers. 

    Everyone who declares that something permissible is forbidden 
    to him, such as food, drink or concubines, or swears an oath by Allaah that 
    he will do something or nor do something, then breaks that oath or wants to 
    break it, has to offer the expiation mentioned. 

    You have to offer kafaarat yameen for your declaring that 
    your husband is forbidden to you like your father. This expiation means 
    feeding ten poor persons, giving each one a kilo and a half of staple food, 
    or clothing them, giving a garment to each one, or freeing a believing 
    slave. If you cannot do any of these three things, then you have to fast for 
    three days. Your husband is not forbidden to you. And you have to repent to 
    Allaah from that, because it is not permissible for a Muslim to forbid to 
    himself something that has been permitted by Allaah.

32715,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/32715,He bought land with the intention of selling it. How should he pay zakah on it?,"I bought some land for 115,000 riyals with the intention of selling it, and one year has passed. Do I have to pay zakah? How much is the threshold of zakah (nisab) in Saudi riyals, if zakah is due on it?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The fact that you took possession of the land with the intention of selling it means that zakah is due on it every year, so you should calculate the value of the land at the end of the year and pay zakah on this amount. The rate of zakah that must be paid on it is one-quarter of one-tenth, i.e. 2.5%, which should be paid in the ways specified by Allah in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“As-Sadaqaat (here it means zakah) are only for the Fuqaraa’ (poor), and Al-Masaakeen (the poor) and those employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in debt; and for Allah’s Cause (i.e. for Mujaahidoon — those fighting in a holy battle), and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty imposed by Allah. And Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise” [Al-Tawbah 9:60]
It should be noted that if goods for trade are bought with gold, silver or cash money (riyals, dollars or other currencies), or in return for other goods (barter), then the year for calculating zakah starts from the time when you acquired the wealth with which you paid for the goods. Based on this, then the year for the goods does not start from the time you took possession of them, rather it starts from the time you acquired the wealth with which you paid for them. 
For example: if a man takes possession of one thousand riyals in Ramadan, then he starts the reckoning of the year. Then in Sha’baan of the following year (i.e., one month before the year ends) he buys some goods for trade with this thousand, then he should pay zakah on these goods in Ramadaan, in other words just one month after he took possession of them. That is because the year for these goods is based on the year for the money with which they were bought.  
See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/149, by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him). 
It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 9/331. 
zakah is due on land that is prepared to be bought and sold, because it comes under the heading of trade goods, and thus is included in the general meaning of the texts of the Qur’aan and Sunnah which state that zakah is obligatory, such as the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it” [Al-Tawbah 9:103]
And Abu Dawood narrated with a hasan isnaad that Samurah ibn Jundub (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (S) commanded us to pay zakah on whatever we had prepared for sale. This is also the view of the majority of scholars, and it is the truth. 
The Standing Committee was asked: 
With regard to lands that are bought for the purpose of selling, how should we calculate them when we calculate zakah – should we base it on the price for which we bought them or on the market value at the time when the year for zakah has passed? 
They replied: 
Lands that are bought for the purpose of selling come under the heading of trade goods. The general principle in Islamic sharee’ah is that trade goods are to be calculated upon the completion of one year at market value, regardless of the price for which they were bought, whether that was more or less than the market price at the time when zakah becomes due. The zakah should be paid from their value. The rate of zakah is one-quarter of one-tenth. So for land worth one thousand riyals, for example, the zakah is twenty-five riyals, and so on.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 9/324, 325). 
With regard to the nisab for zakah, as previously stated in question no. 42072 , the nisab for zakah on gold is twenty dinars i.e., 85 grams of gold; the nisab for silver is two hundred dirhams, i.e., 595 grams of silver. 
The nisab for money (i.e., Saudi riyals or other currencies) is whatever reaches the value of the nisab for gold or silver. As the value of silver is now less than that of gold, the nisab for money now is the equivalent of 595 grams of silver.

32716,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/32716,The delayed portion of the dowry is regarded as a debt that the husband owes,"Is the delayed portion of the dowry regarded as a debt left by a husband who has died, and must it be paid to the wife from his estate? Please note that he had not consummated the marriage with the wife.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly:  
It is permissible for the 
    dowry to be paid immediately or to be deferred, or for part to be paid 
    immediately and part deferred… If it is stipulated that it should be paid at 
    a specific time, then it must be paid at that time, but if it is deferred 
    without specifying the time when it is to be paid, then according to 
    Al-Qaadi, the mahr (dowry) is valid and the time for it to be paid is upon 
    separation. Ahmad said: If a dowry is being paid in two parts, one immediate 
    and one deferred, the deferred is only payable in the case of (the 
    husband’s) death or separation. End quote. 

    This was stated by Ibn Qudaamah in al-Mughni, 10/115 

    Secondly: 

    If one of the spouses died before the marriage is 
    consummated, the woman is entitled to the mahr in full. 

    This was stated in Mughni al-Muhtaaj, 4/374, where it 
    says that there was consensus among the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with 
    them) on this point. 

    It was also mentioned in al-Insaaf (21/227) where it 
    says that there is no scholarly dispute on this matter. 

    Thirdly: 
If the husband dies, the 
    mahr that had not been paid to the wife becomes a debt that he still owes; 
    it should be taken from the estate before it is divided among the heirs. 

    The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked:   

    Is the delayed portion of the mahr permissible or not? If it 
    is permissible but the husband has died and he did not divorce his wife, is 
    it a debt that he left behind or not? 

    They replied: 

    It is permissible for the entire dowry to be paid in advance 
    or to be deferred, or part of it may be paid in advance and part of it 
    deferred. Whatever was deferred must be paid when the time stipulated comes. 
    If no specific time was stipulated, then the husband must pay it if he 
    divorces his wife, and it must be paid from his estate if he dies. End

32719,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/32719,Obligation of fulfilling promises and vows,"I engaged in some trade, and I promised to give a certain amount of the profits for the sake of Allah. My question is:
 Can I spend this amount on the marriages expenses of my brother, cousins and relatives, because they are not well-off? Is it essential to tell them that this is charity? Can I give some of it to a needy relative even if he is one of those who want to show off in their wedding and spend extravagantly even if they are in need?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.You have to fulfil your promise of spending a specific amount for the sake of Allah. If you intended or specified a particular area then you have to spend the money in that way, and not in any other. If you did not intend or specify a particular area, then you have the choice of spending it in whatever charitable way you want. 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah: 
The basic principle is that if whatever was vowed is something that is prescribed or allowed in sharee’ah, then it should be spent in the manner intended by the one who made the vow. If he did not make any specific intention then he may spend it in any manner in which charity is given, such as giving to the poor and needy…” 
Fatawa Islamiyyah, 3/485. 
Giving to your brother and your cousins who are in need is a kind of doing good, and in fact giving to needy relatives is better than giving to others. Al-Bukhaari (146) and Muslim (998) narrated that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Abu Talhah was the richest of the Ansaar of Madeenah in date-palms, and the most beloved of his wealth to him was Bayruha’ (the name of a garden), which was opposite the mosque. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to enter it and drink from its good water. When this verse was revealed (interpretation of the meaning): 
“By no means shall you attain Al-Birr (piety, righteousness — here it means Allah’s reward, i.e. Paradise), unless you spend (in Allah’s Cause) of that which you love”[Aal ‘Imraan 3:92]
Abu Talhah went to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, Allah says, ‘By no means shall you attain Al-Birr (piety, righteousness — here it means Allah’s reward, i.e. Paradise), unless you spend (in Allah’s Cause) of that which you love’, and the most beloved of my wealth to me is Bayruha’; it is charity for the sake of Allah and I hope for its reward stored with Allah. Give it, O Messenger of Allah, as Allah guides you.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Well done! That is a good deal! I heard what you said, and I think that you should give it to your relatives.” Abu Talhah said: “I shall do that, O Messenger of Allah.” So Abu Talhah shared it out among his relatives and the sons of his uncle. 
Charity given to a relative is both charity and upholding the ties of kinship. See questions no.  21810 and  20173. 
You do not have to tell them that this is charity or the fulfillment of a vow. See question no.  33777. 
But you should not give it to one who will use it to help him disobey Allah or who is known for being extravagant or showing off, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression”
[al-Maa’idah 5:2]

32724,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/32724,"He vowed to give 100,000 riyals in charity. Should he fulfil his vow?","A person said to Allaah, “If I do such and such, then I will give 100,000 riyals in charity.” Then he did that thing, but now he regrets it and does not want to give this large amount in charity. Is it permissible for him to offer kafaarat yameen (expiation for breaking a vow), or does he have to give this amount in charity, knowing that he has 400,000 riyals?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, you have to fulfil your vow, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever vows to do an act of obedience to Allaah, then let him obey Him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6318. But there are 
    some matters to which attention must be paid: 
Firstly: 
The definition of a vow (nadhr) is when a person who is accountable (mukallaf) 
    commits himself to doing something that he is not obliged to do according to sharee’ah. 
Secondly: 
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade making vows. 
It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us not to make vows and said, “They do not ward off anything that Allaah has decreed, rather 
    they are a means of getting charity from those who are stingy.”  
Al-Nawawi said: 
What is meant by the words “they are a means of getting charity from those who are stingy” is 
    that the stingy person does not do anything by his own initiative, rather he does it in return for healing of sickness or other reasons. 
Some of the scholars – including Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah – are of the view 
    that vows are haraam, but the majority of scholars said that they are makrooh. However there is no difference of opinion concerning the fact that 
    if a person makes a vow, fulfilling his vow becomes obligatory. 
It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever vows to do an act of obedience to Allaah, then let him obey Him, but whoever vows 
    to do an act of disobedience to Allaah, let him not disobey Him.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6318 
Islam condemns those who make vows and do not fulfil them, and states that they 
    would come after the best generations. 
It was narrated that ‘Imraan ibn Husayn (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The best of my ummah is my generation, then those who come after them, 
    then those who come after them.” ‘Imraan said, I do not know if he mentioned two or three generations after his. “Then after you there will come 
    people who will bear witness without being asked to do so, and will be treacherous and untrustworthy, and they will vow and never fulfill their 
    vows, and fatness will appear among them.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2508; Muslim, 2535 
Based on this, the one who made this vow has to give the amount he vowed to give 
    in charity. It is not permissible for him not to fulfil his vow, and it is not sufficient for him to offer kafaarat yameen when he is able to pay 
    the amount he vowed to give in charity. 
It was narrated that Thaabit ibn al-Dahhaak said: At the time of the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) a man vowed to sacrifice a camel in Buwaanah. He came to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) and said, “I vowed to sacrifice a camel in Buwaanah.” The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Is 
    there any idol of the Jaahiliyyah there that is worshipped?” He said, “No.” He said, “Are any of their festivals celebrated there?” He said, “No.” 
    The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Fulfil your vow, for no vow should be fulfilled if it involves 
    disobedience towards Allaah or that which the son of Adam has no control over.” 
Narrated by Abu Dawood, 3313; classed as saheeh by al-Haafiz ibn Hajar in 
    al-Talkhees al-Habeer, 4/180. 
Al-San’aani said: 
This proves that the one who vows to give charity or to offer a sacrifice in a specific place 
    has the individual duty to fulfil his vow so long as there is nothing connected to the people of Jaahiliyyah in that place. 
Subul al-Salaam, 4/114  
But if his 
    intention in making this vow is to stop himself doing this action, then in 
    this case it comes under the ruling on kafaarat yameen (expiation for 
    breaking a vow) and he does not have to fulfil this vow. Please see question 
    no. 45889.

He works with some men from the Society for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice. I know that his working with them is regarded as an honour for me and Allaah knows that I am happy when he is able to change some evils. 

But my problem with him is that he is so strongly attached to them. For example, when we go out for a walk, if he sees something bad he follows it until he can contact some men from the Society and they come. If I argue with him about it, he thinks that I do not want to put an end to evil! Allaah knows that that is not true, but I want him to take it easy. Also, what bothers me about this matter is that he speaks to women a lot, and this makes me crazy and makes me jealous when he says that this one was dressed like this and that one looked like that. 

Tell me what I should do, may Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly we 
    congratulate you on your good attitude of being pleased with what your 
    husband does, which is the work of the Prophets themselves (peace be upon 
    them), namely enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and 
    calling people to Allaah. 
We advise 
    you to stand by your husband’s side and encourage him in this work, and not 
    to have any doubts about him or to feel fed up with what he does.  
With regard 
    to what he tells you about women, it seems that he is telling you because he 
    trusts you, and is not telling you in order to upset you, or to express his 
    admiration for them. Rather he is telling you that in order to inform you of 
    some of the evil actions that people do, so that you can beware of them, or 
    so as to get it off his chest. When some people see evil actions, it affects 
    them deeply, and they need someone to talk to about it so as to get it off 
    their chests. So you should be aware of that and not let the Shaytaan get to 
    you with regard to this matter. 
There is no 
    reason why you should not advise him with regard to the things in which he 
    is falling short towards you, so long as that is done in the way that is 
    better and without casting aspersions on his decency and morals. 
Our advice 
    to the husband is to give his family their rights, and to treat them in a 
    reasonable manner. He should respect their feelings and not describe women 
    to his wife; just as a man would not like his wife to describe men to him, 
    so too a woman does not like her husband to describe women to her. 
He should 
    avoid speaking too much to women, and restrict it only to what is needed in 
    order to change the evil or to draw attention to it, etc, because being too 
    careless and lax about that may lead to bad consequences. And he should 
    strive to lower his gaze, because looking is one of the arrows of Iblees.

Is it permissible for me to pray the obligatory prayers in the store, knowing that it is impossible for tourists to come in with alcohol in their hands?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly:  
Selling pottery pieces is permissible for both Muslims and kuffaar, but if these pieces are in the form of statues and images of animate beings, then it is not permissible to sell them or deal in them unless the heads are removed. 
The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 
It is not permissible for a Muslim to sell statues or deal in them, because of the saheeh ahaadeeth which state that it is haraam to make images of animate beings or erect statues of animate beings in general terms, or to keep them. Undoubtedly dealing in statues makes images more easily available and helps them to be set up in homes and clubs, etc. 
As that is haraam, the income from making and selling them is also haraam. It is not permissible for a Muslim to live on this money or buy food and clothing with it, etc. Based on this, if a person has done this he has to get rid of that money and repent to Allaah, that He may accept his repentance. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them (till his death)”
[Ta-Ha 20:82]
We have issued a fatwa stating that images of animate beings are haraam, whether they are three-dimensional or otherwise, whether they are produced by carving, engraving, dyeing or by means of modern equipment.

In the answer to question no. 7222 there are more details about making images and the prohibition on this action.

With regard to praying, it is obligatory to pray in congregation in the mosque. See question no. 120. If the mosque is close enough to you that you can hear the adhaan without loudspeakers, then you have to attend the congregational prayer in the mosque. 
If the mosque is far away and you cannot hear the adhaan except with loudspeakers, then you can pray in the store, but it is better for you to set aside a place in the store where you can pray in congregation.

    enjoined upholding of family ties and kind treatment of one's wife. We will 
    never tell you to sever your ties with your sisters or with your wife. 
    Rather we tell you: bring them together and do not make the division worse. 
Love comes 
    from Allaah. He has created causes of love and causes of hate. So you have 
    to look at your relationships and seek out the causes of hate and enmity so 
    that you can remove them. And you should try to bring in the causes of love 
    so as to encourage it. These causes include: greeting with salaam, giving 
    gifts, visiting people when they are sick, helping at times of need, and 
    many other things which Islam tells us strengthen bonds and generate love

In order to 
    calm both sides down, you also have to remind each of them of Allaah and His 
    warning against gossiping, insulting, slandering and interfering in people’s 
    private affairs. 
Adhering to 
    the limits set by Allaah and giving each party their rights, and respecting 
    the rights of the other party and not belittling them or annoying them, will 
    also guarantee happiness and peace in the house and in your relationships. 
You have to 
    advise your wife and your siblings to treat one another well, and try to 
    remove the problems and disputes that exist between them. If your wife and 
    siblings are living in the same house, there is nothing wrong with you 
    giving your wife her own accommodation, if you cannot reconcile between 
    them. Indeed, this may be a means of removing the disputes between them. 
Our advice 
    to your wife is that she should be friendly towards her husband’s family and 
    treat them kindly as much as she can, without doing anything that is 
    forbidden according to sharee’ah. Respecting her husband’s family will make

This is because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Start with yourself and then with your dependents.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2/117, 6/190; Muslim, 2/717, 718, 721, no. 1034, 1036, 1042) 
With regard to his dependents, if they do not have anything to give as zakat al-fitr on behalf of themselves, then they are not obliged to pay it, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.” [al-Baqarah 2:286]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no sadaqah except for one who has the means.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2/117, 6/190; Muslim, 2/717, no. 1034)
And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If I command you to do a thing, then do as much of it as you can.” 
And Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions.

32752,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/32752,Selling video tapes and keeping a TV and VCR,Is selling video and audio tapes haraam?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.If the audio and video tapes are free of haraam content, then it is permissible to 
    listen to them, watch them, buy them and sell them. What is meant by haraam is if they contain immorality, music and pictures of unveiled women. 
    The same applies if they contain kufr or bid’ah – except for one who intends to refute them and is qualified to do so. 
The Standing Committee was asked: Is it permissible to sell tapes of singing such 
    as tapes of Umm Kalthoom, Fareed al-Atrash and their like? 
They replied: 
“Selling these tapes is haraam, because of the haraam songs that they contain. 
    Listening to them is also haraam. It was narrated in a saheeh hadeeth that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    ‘When Allaah forbids a thing He also forbids its price.’”  
From Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 13/48 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about trading in video tapes in which 
    unveiled women appear and in which stories of love are told – is the businessman’s money haraam? What should he do? How can he get rid of these 
    tapes? 
He replied: 
It is haraam to sell or keep these tapes, or to listen to them or watch them, because they 
    promote fitnah and immorality. They must be destroyed and the one who deal with them should be denounced, so as to prevent immorality and to 
    protect the Muslims from the causes of fitnah. 
Fataawa Islamiyyah, 2/369. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about the trader 
    who deals in tapes of songs that also include musical instruments, immoral speech, promiscuous love, promotion of corruption, and spreading 
    immorality between the sexes, and renting stores to people who sell these kinds of tapes. 
He replied: 
If these tapes contain the kinds of things that you mention, of all kinds of 
    musical instruments, promotion of corruption and immorality, spreading promiscuity between the sexes, obscene talk and promiscuous love, then no 
    wise person, let alone one who believes in Allaah and the Last Day and fears the punishment of Allaah and hopes for His reward, will doubt that 
    selling these tapes and listening to them is haraam and is an evil action, because they destroy morals and society, and expose the ummah to 
    punishment on an individual and general basis. 
Any person who has any of these tapes should repent to Allaah and erase whatever 
    is on them, and replace them with something useful. 
With regard to the money earned by selling them and dealing in them, it is haraam 
    money which is not permissible to its owner, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When Allaah forbids a 
    thing, He also forbids its price.” 
With regard to renting out stores to people who sell these kinds of tapes, that is 
    also haraam, and the rent taken for that is haraam, because this is a kind of co-operating in sin and transgression which Allaah has forbidden as 
    He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but do not help one another in sin and transgression”
[al-Maa’idah 5:2]
The sin of those who buy them is upon them, but it is not farfetched to say that the seller and 
    landlord of the store will also share some of the burden of sin, without that detracting in the slightest from the burden of those who buy them. 
    And Allaah knows best.” 
Fataawa Islamiyyah, 2/370. 
And it says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 13/46: 
It is permissible to keep a TV and VCR in your house, if you can control yourself and only use 
    them to listen to religious lectures and beneficial knowledge, recitation of Qur’aan and business news, political news and other permissible 
    things. 
If you cannot do that, then do not sell it, because it is most likely that the one 
    who buys it from you will use it for idle entertainment and all the haraam things for which it is used. Rather you should destroy what you have of 
    such things, so as to get rid of evil, and you will be rewarded for that. But if you find someone whom you think will most likely use them for 
    permissible things, then there is nothing wrong with your selling them to him.",Islam Q&A
32762,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/32762,The Jews’ attempts to kill the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him),"I have heard the following: that the Jews tried to kill the Messenger 3 times. And the last time was 6 years before the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died, with poisoned mutton, of which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ate two mouthfuls, then Allaah caused the sheep to speak and tell the Messenger that it was poisoned. When the Messenger died, he said that it was as if he could taste that mutton. Is this true? If it is true, then it means that we have a great score to settle with them.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Jews wanted to kill the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) on several occasions, including the following: 
1 – When he was a child. Ibn Sa’d narrated in al-Tabaqaat, with an isnaad going 
    back to Ishaaq ibn ‘Abd-Allaah that when the mother of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave him to the Sa’di woman 
    who breastfed him, she said to her, “Keep him safe,” and she told her what she had seen. Haleemah al-Sa’diyyah passed by some Jews and said, “Will 
    you not tell me about this son of mine? I conceived him in such and such a manner, and I gave birth to him in such and such a manner, and I saw 
    such and such,” and she repeated what his mother had told her. They said to one another, “Kill him!” They asked her, “Is he an orphan?” She said, 
    “No, this is his father and I am his mother.” They said, “If he had been an orphan we would have killed him.” Haleemah (his wet nurse) took him 
    and said, “I nearly lost that which had been entrusted to me.” 
This report is mursal, but the men of its isnaad are thiqaat (trustworthy). 
2 – They tried to kill him  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) after 
    Badr. Banu al-Nadeer sent for him to come out to them with thirty of his companions, and said “We will send out thirty of our rabbis, to meet in 
    such and such a place, halfway between us and you, so that they can listen to you. If they believe in you then we will all believe in you.” Then 
    they said: “How can we reach an understanding when there are sixty of us? Send out three of your companions and we will send out three of our 
    scholars to listen to you. They were carrying concealed daggers and they wanted to kill the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him). A sincere woman from among Banu al-Nadeer sent word to her nephew (her brother’s son) who was a Muslim man from among the 
    Ansaar, and told him about that, and he told the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) went back, and the following day he brought his troops and besieged them, and the Jews of Banu al-Nadeer were expelled. 
    This story was narrated by ‘Abd al-Razzaaq in his Musannaf, and by Abu Dawood in his Sunan (3004), via ‘Abd al-Razzaaq, but he does 
    not mention the details of the story, rather he says, “… ‘They will listen to you and if they believe in you, we shall believe in you.’ The 
    narrator then narrated the whole story. When the next day came, the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went out 
    in the morning with an army, and besieged them.” This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
3 – Ibn Ishaaq mentions another reason for the expulsion of Banu al-Nadeer, which is that the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went to Banu al-Nadeer to ask them for help in paying the diyah of two men of ahl 
    al-dhimmah who had been killed by mistake by ‘Amr ibn Umayyah al-Dumari. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sat by a 
    wall belonging to Banu al-Nadeer, and they plotted to throw a rock on him and kill him. The Revelation informed him of that and he rushed back to 
    Madeenah, then he issued orders that they should be besieged. 
4 – Then came the poisoning incident, after the conquest of Khaybar. Al-Bukhaari 
    (2617) and Muslim (2190) narrated from Anas that a Jewish woman came to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    with some poisoned mutton. The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ate from it, then he asked her about that. She 
    said, “I wanted to kill you.” He said, “Allaah would not let you do that.” They said, “Shall we kill her?” He said, “No.” He said, I can still see 
    the effect of that on the palate of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
Al-Nawawi said: It is as if the poison still left some trace of blackness etc. 
The name of this woman was Zaynab bint al-Haarith, the wife of Salaam ibn Mashkam, 
    one of the leaders of the Jews. 
The reports differ as to whether or not she was killed. It seems that the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not kill her at first, but when Bishr ibn al-Bara’ ibn Ma’roor died as a result of the 
    effects of this food, then he executed her as a qisaas punishment.
 Al-Bukhaari (5777) narrated that Abu Hurayrah said:  When Khaybar was conquered, 
    a roasted poisoned sheep was presented to the Prophet as a gift (by the Jews). The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said, “Let all the Jews who have been here, be assembled before me.” The Jews were gathered and the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Will you now tell me the truth, if I ask you about something?” They replied, “Yes.” He asked, “Have you 
    poisoned this sheep?” They said, “Yes.” He asked, “What made you do that?” They said, “We wanted to know if you were a liar in which case we would 
    have got rid of you, and if you are a Prophet then the poison would not harm you.” 
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to feel ill 
    because of this food, and he would be treated with cupping for that. 
Ahmad (2784) narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that a Jewish woman sent a gift to the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) of a poisoned roasted sheep. He sent for her and asked her, “What made you do 
    what you did?” She said, “I wanted to see if you were a Prophet, then Allaah would tell you about it, and if you were not a Prophet the people 
    would be rid of you.” Whenever the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) felt ill as a result of that he would have 
    himself treated by cupping. On one occasion he traveled and when he entered ihraam he felt ill as a result of that and he had himself treated by 
    cupping. The editor of al-Musnad classed it as saheeh. 
That had an impact in causing his death, so he  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) died as a martyr (shaheed), as Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: 
“If I were to swear by Allaah nine times that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was killed, that is more beloved to me than swearing once, because Allaah made him a Prophet and made him a 
    martyr.” Narrated by Ahmad, 3617. The editors said, its isnaad is saheeh according to the conditions of Muslim. 
Al-Sindi said: The words “he was killed” mean by the poison in the meat of the 
    sheep’s foreleg that he ate, when the effects of that appeared when he was dying. 
Quoted from Haashiyat al-Musnad, 6/116. 
Al-Bukhaari narrated in his Saheeh, in a mu’allaq report, and al-Haakim 
    narrated in his Mustadrak in a mawsool report, that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “The Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) used to say, in the illness which would be his last, ‘O ‘Aa’ishah, I still feel the pain of the food that I ate in Khaybar, 
    and this time I feel that my aorta is being cut from that poison.” 
The aorta is the vein that is towards the back and is connected to the heart; if 
    it is cut then the person will die. 
The conquest of Khaybar took place in Muharram or Rabee’ al-Awwal of the year 7 
    AH. So this event took place four years before the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died. 
This is in addition to the recorded crimes of the Jews which know no limit in 
    ancient or modern times. The enmity between us and them will last until we fight them and kill them at the end of time, as the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has told us.
