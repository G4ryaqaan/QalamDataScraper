9403,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9403,How to make people aware of the world around them through Friday khutbahs,"We as Friday khateebs are faced with criticism from some of our close friends and from the people at large, when we address different religious topics and other matters which deal with the situation of the ummah. One person likes this topic and another does not, and they are divided into those who agree with the khutbah and those who are opposed. How should the good khateeb be, and what are your guidelines as to the best way of making the people aware through the minbar and connecting them to their religion?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The 
          good khateeb is the one who says something from which those present 
          can benefit, no matter what their level is, whether they are common 
          folk or educated or well-read or youngsters or elderly. In order to 
          achieve that, the khateeb will be faced with some difficulties in choosing 
          the right expressions and topics to benefit everyone, but with practice 
          and experience, he will be able to achieve that and get acceptable results. 
          
 The 
          good khateeb is the one who is concerned with teaching the people about 
          their religion and explaining the basic principles of sharee’ah, explaining 
          the holistic matters and giving more details of matters of ‘aqeedah 
          and fiqh and other issues which the people need to know. 
 The 
          good khateeb is the one who makes the most of events which Allaah decrees 
          should come to pass, so he refers to them and talks about them from 
          an Islamic point of view, in the light of the Qur’aan and Sunnah. He 
          uses this important means of education to teach the people, i.e., education 
          by means of events. This is a method which we see in the verses of Soorat 
          Aal ‘Imraan, which 
          comment on the battle of Uhud, where Allaah mentions the great lessons 
          to be learned from the events of that campaign. 
 The 
          good khateeb is the one who combines mention of the views of the earlier 
          and later scholars, with mention of the dangers and events faced by 
          the Muslim ummah. 
 The 
          good khateeb is one who offers variety in his khutbahs. So sometimes 
          he speaks of matters of Tawheed, and sometimes he warns against different 
          kinds of shirk, or 
          he calls people to follow the Sunnah and avoid bid’ah and its dangers, 
          or he explains some matters of fiqh which the people need to know, or 
          he discusses the events that the ummah is facing in the light of the 
          Qur’aan and Sunnah and the words of the scholars, and so on. At the 
          same time, his khutbahs must also soften people’s hearts and remind 
          them of Allaah and the Last Day, because that is one of the main aims 
          of the khutbah. In conclusion, if the khateeb achieves a balanced and 
          wise approach, then no one has the right to object to him. And Allaah 
          is the Source of strength.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

9410,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9410,Types of Speech to Refrain from,"I know there are certain types of speech which we must refrain from, like the speech the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) stayed away from; please could you expound on that for me?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Muslim has to control his tongue and not speak unless he says something good. 
Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him speak good or else keep silent …” 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “If he wants to speak, then if what he wants to say is good and he is confident that he will be rewarded for it, whether it is obligatory or praiseworthy, then let him speak, but if it does not seem to him that it is good and he will be rewarded for it, then let him refrain from speaking, whether he thinks it is haram (impermissible) or makrooh (disliked) or permissible. Based on this, it is recommended to refrain from saying permissible words and we are enjoined to avoid this, lest it lead us into something that is haram or makrooh, which is what happens in many cases or in most cases. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘Not a word does he (or she) utter but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it).’ [50:18] 
Al-Imam al-Shafi’i understood the hadeeth (narration) to mean that if a person wants to say something, he should think about it: if it seems to him that it will not do any harm, then he should speak, but if he thinks that it will do some harm or he thinks that this is most likely, then he should refrain from speaking.” 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us to control our tongues in more than one hadeeth, such as that narrated by al-Tirmidhi from ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, what is salvation?’ He said, ‘Control your tongue, keep to your house and weep over your sin.’” Classed as saheeh (authentic) by al-Albani. 
Al-Tirmidhi also narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Mu’adh (may Allah be pleased with him), after teaching him some of the laws of Islam, “Shall I not tell you what is the foundation of all that?” I [Mu’adh] said: “Of course, O Prophet of Allah.” He took hold of his tongue and said, “Control this.” I said, “O Prophet of Allah, will we be held responsible for what we say with it?” He said, “May your mother be bereft of you, O Mu’adh! Will the people be thrown into Hell on their faces or on their noses for anything other than the harvest of their tongues?” Classed as saheeh by al-Albani.
The hadeeth enjoins refraining from indulging in specific things, because this is something that is of no benefit to a person, and indeed it may cause him a great deal of harm in his spiritual and worldly affairs. 
It was narrated from Ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If my Companions are mentioned, then keep quiet; if the stars are mentioned, then keep quiet; and if the divine decree is mentioned, then keep quiet.” (Narrated by al-Tabarani and classed as saheeh / authentic). 
This hadeeth indicates that it is not permissible for a person to speak badly of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and that he should keep quiet about the disputes that occurred among them, because speaking badly of them or criticizing them implies that one is rejecting what Allah said about them in the Quran, where He praised them by saying (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And the foremost to embrace Islam of the Muhajiroon (emigrants) and the Ansar (helpers) and also those who followed them exactly (in faith). Allah is well-pleased with them as they are well-pleased with Him. He has prepared for them gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.” [9:100] 
And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. And those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and falling down prostrate (in prayer), seeking bounty from Allah and (His) good pleasure. The mark of them (i.e. of their faith) is on their faces (foreheads) from the traces of prostration (during prayers).”
[48:29] 
This is how Allah has described them in His Book, so no doubt they are of just character and are the best and greatest of mankind. So no one hates them but a hypocrite and no one loves them but a believer. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“One of the basic principles of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah (followers of prophetic tradition) is that they think and say nothing to criticize the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as Allah has described them in the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘And those who came after them say: Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in faith, and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful.’
[59:10] 
And they obey the command of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): ‘Do not curse my Companions, for by the One in Whose hand is my soul, if any one of you were to spend the equivalent of Mount Uhud in gold, he would not reach the status of one of them, nor even come half way.’ (Agreed upon).” Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 3/152. 
Abu Zar’ah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“If you see a man criticizing any one of the sahabah (Companions), then know that he is a heretic, because the Quran is true, and the Messenger is true, and what he brought is true, and no one conveyed all of that to us but the sahabah. So whoever criticizes them means, in effect, to say that the Quran and Sunnah (prophetic teachings) are false, so it is more appropriate that he should be criticized and ruled to be a heretic who is misguided.” 
Al-Sawa’iq al-Muhriqah ‘ala Ahl al-Rafd wa’l-Dalal wa’l-Zandaqah. 
With regard to the second part of the hadeeth, which enjoins refraining from speaking about the stars, what is referred to by that – and Allah knows best – is seeking guidance by the stars concerning matters that are unseen, as the people of the jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic days of ignorance) used to do by means of astrology, such as using the movement of heavenly bodies to indicate when certain earthly events would occur, such as the blowing of the wind, rainfall, changes in prices, and other matters which they claimed to know from the movements of heavenly bodies. They used to say that whoever got married under a particular star, then such and such would happen to him, or whoever traveled under a particular star, such and such would happen to him, and whoever was born under a particular star would be lucky or unlucky, etc. 
(See Kitab al-Tawheed by al-Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan. See also Fatawa al-‘Aqeedah by al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, where he makes some very useful comments). 
With regard to the third part of the hadeeth, which refers to refraining from speaking about the divine decree (al-qadar), Abu Ja’far al-Tahhawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The divine decree is a secret known which Allah has hidden from His creation. No angel who is close to Him and no Prophet whom He sent knows that. Pursuing such matters only leads to failure and deprivation of the mercy of Allah, and it leads to injustice, so beware of looking into the matter, thinking about it and wondering about it. Allah has kept knowledge of His decree from His slaves, and has forbidden them to pursue the matter, as He says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘He cannot be questioned as to what He does, while they will be questioned.’
[21:23] 
So whoever questions what Allah does has rejected the ruling of the Book, and whoever rejects the ruling of the Book is a kafir (disbeliever).” Sharh al-‘Aqeedah al-Tahhawiyyah. 
So the Muslim has to submit to Allah in all His affairs, and know that whatever happens to him could never have missed him, and what misses him could never have happened to him. There is a lot that may be said on this topic. May Allah bless the man who believes in the will and decree of Allah without indulging in philosophical discussion about the matter.",Islam Q&A

The one who does that is a loser and a sinner. Allah forbade that in the Quran, when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression” [Al-Maa’idah 5:2]
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed ten types of people with regard to alcohol. 
It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed ten types of people with regard to alcohol: the one who presses (the grapes, etc), the one for whom that is done, the one who drinks it, the one who carries it, the one to whom it is carried, the one who offers itut, the one who sells it, the one who consumes its price, the one who buys it and the one for whom it is bought. 
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1259; Ibn Maajah, 3381. This hadith was classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, no. 1041 
So whoever drinks alcohol or helps someone else to do so deserves the curse narrated in this hadith. So it is not permissible for you to help anyone to drink alcohol or to commit any other haraam action.

For more about circumcision in Islam and the wisdom behind it, see the detailed answer.","The meaning of circumcision in Islam (khitan)


History of circumcision


Ruling on circumcision in Islam


How is circumcision done?


Male circumcision: Why?


Female circumcision: Why?


Paying money for circumcision: Permissible?","Praise be to Allah.Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) wrote a useful book on the rulings concerning the newborn, which he called Tuhfat al-Mawdud fi Ahkam al-Mawlud. In this book he wrote an extensive chapter in which he spoke of circumcision and the rulings thereon . The following is a summary of that, with additional comments from some other scholars. 
The meaning of circumcision in Islam (khitan)
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
Khitan is a noun describing the action of the circumciser (khatin). It is also used to describe the site of the circumcision, as in the hadith, “When the two circumcised parts (al-khitanan) meet, ghusl becomes obligatory.” In the case of a female the word used is khafad. In the male it is also called i’dhar. The one who is uncircumcised is called aghlaf or aqlaf. (Tuhfat al-Mawlud, 1/152)
History of circumcision
Circumcision is the Sunnah of Prophet Ibrahim and the prophets after him. 
Al-Bukhari (6298) and Muslim (2370) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Ibrahim (peace be upon him) circumcised himself when he was eighty years old, and he circumcised himself with an adze.”  
An adze (qadum) is a carpenter’s tool; it was also said that al-Qadum is a place in Syria.
Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar said: 
It is most likely that what is referred to in the hadith is the tool. Abu Ya’la narrated that ‘Ali ibn Rabah said: “Ibrahim was commanded to circumcise himself, so he circumcised himself with an adze and it was very painful for him. Then Allah revealed to him saying, “You rushed to do it before We told you what tool to use.” He said, “O Lord, I did not want to delay obeying Your command.” 
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
“Circumcision was one of the things with which Allah tested Ibrahim, His Close Friend. He did them perfectly so Allah made him a leader of mankind. It was narrated that he was the first one who was circumcised, as mentioned above. What it says in al-Sahih is that Ibrahim circumcised himself when he was eighty years old. After him, circumcision continued among the messengers and their followers, even the Messiah. He was circumcised and the Christians affirm that, and do not deny that, as they also affirm that he was forbidden the flesh of pigs…” (Tuhfat al-Mawdud, p. 158-159)
Ruling on circumcision in Islam
But the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differed as to the ruling on circumcision. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The most correct view is that it is obligatory in the case of men and Sunnah in the case of women. The difference between them is that in the case of men, it serves an interest which has to do with one of the conditions of prayer, namely purity (taharah), because if the foreskin remains, when the urine comes out of the urethra, some of it will collect there, and this causes burning and infection every time the person moves, and every time the foreskin is squeezed, some drops of urine come out, thus causing najasah (impurity). 
In the case of women, it serves a useful purpose which is to reduce desire. This is seeking perfection, not removing something harmful.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 1/133-134) 
This is the view of Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him). Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni (1/115): As for circumcision, it is obligatory for men and it is good in the case of women, but it is not obligatory for them. 
How is circumcision done?
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Abu’l-Barakat said in his book al-Ghayah: In circumcision of a man, the skin at the tip of the penis (the foreskin) is removed; if he only removes most of it, that is permissible. It is mustahabb to circumcise females provided that is not done in an extreme manner. It was narrated that ‘Umar said to a woman who circumcised females, “Leave some of it if you circumcise (a girl).” Al-Khallal said in his Jami’: What is cut when circumcising: Muhammad ibn al-Husayn told me that al-Fadl ibn Ziyad told them: Ahmad was asked, How much should be cut in circumcision? He said, Until the glans (tip of the penis) becomes visible. 
Ibn al-Sabbagh said in al-Shamil: What is obligatory in the case of a man is to cut the skin on the tip of the penis until the entire glans becomes visible. In the case of a woman, it means cutting the skin that looks like the comb of a rooster at the top of the vagina, between the two labia; if it is cut the base of it should be left like a date pit.  
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
The well-known correct view is that everything covering the glans must be cut. (Al-Majmu’, 1/351) 
Al-Juwayni said:  
The hadith indicates that not too much of it should be removed (in the case of women), because he said, “Leave something sticking out and do not go to extremes in cutting.” (Tuhfat al-Mawdud, 190-192)
The point is that in the case of males, all the skin covering the tip of the penis should be cut, but in the case of females only a part of the skin that is like a rooster’s comb at the top of the vagina should be cut. 
Male circumcision: Why?
With regard to a man, he cannot be clean from urine unless he is circumcised, because drops of urine collect underneath the foreskin and he cannot be sure that they will not drip and make his clothes and body impure. Hence ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abbas was very strict on the issue of circumcision . Imam Ahmad said: Ibn 'Abbas was very strict on this matter, and it was narrated that there is no Hajj and no prayer for him, i.e., if a person is not circumcised his Hajj and prayer are not valid. Al-Mughni, 1/115 
Female circumcision: Why?
With regard to the wisdom behind the circumcision of women , it is to regulate their desire so it will be moderate. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about whether women should be circumcised or not. He replied: 
Yes, they should be circumcised, i.e., the top of the piece of skin that looks like a rooster’s comb should be cut. The Messenger of Allah said to the woman who did circumcisions: “Leave something sticking out and do not go to extremes in cutting. That makes her face look brighter and is more pleasing to her husband.” That is because the purpose of circumcising a man is to make him clean from the impurity that may collect beneath the foreskin. But the purpose of circumcising women is to regulate their desire, because if a woman is not circumcised her desire will be strong. Hence the words “O son of an uncircumcised woman” are used as an insult, because the uncircumcised woman has stronger desire. Hence immoral actions are more common among the women of the Tatars and the Franks, that are not found among the Muslim women. If the circumcision is too severe, the desire is weakened altogether, which is unpleasing for men; but if it is cut without going to extremes in that, the purpose will be achieved, which is moderating desire. And Allah knows best. 
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 21/114 
Paying money for circumcision: Permissible?
Ibn Qudamah said: 
“It is permissible to pay money for circumcision and for medical treatment. We do not know of any difference of opinion on this matter, because it is doing something that is needed and which is allowed in shari’ah. So it is permissible to pay money for it, like all other permissible actions.” (Al-Mughni, 5/314)

My question is, he has been talking about getting married which I know costs alot and I would like my money returned if he has the means to get married he should repay me first. What is my right in this?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is nothing to stop a wife asking for 
    her money back from her husband. This is a right that belongs to her. But we would like to point out a few things. 
1 – A wife should not make things hard for 
    her husband just because he wants to take a second wife. The basic principle is that people – above all husbands and wives – should cooperate in 
    righteousness and piety, and should not make things difficult for a person who seeks something that is permissible. 
2 – The owner of the money should not ask for 
    it back from a debtor who is in difficulty. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if the debtor is in a hard time (has 
    no money), then grant him time till it is easy for him to repay”
[al-Baqarah 2:280]
3 – It is not permissible for a debtor who has the money to pay off his debt to delay paying it 
    off. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The rich person who delays paying back a loan is a wrongdoer.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2166; Muslim, 1564. 
4 – We do not think that the husband should 
    use his wife’s money to take a second wife, because this is upsetting to her. He has to pay back the money to his wife, then if he has enough left 
    to get married, he may do so, otherwise he should not.

With regard to Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), like all other human beings, he was created from the water (semen) of his father, ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib. He is no different from other human beings in the manner in which he was created, as he said about himself, “I am a human being, I forget as you forget.” He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) felt fear, got thirsty, felt cold, suffered from the heat, got sick and died. Everything that humans go through as a part of human nature, he also went through, but he is distinguished by the fact that he received Revelation and he was qualified to bear the Message, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Allah knows best with whom to place His Message.” [al-An’am 6:124]

9431,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9431,Ruling on describing those who are committed to the religion as fundamentalists and extremists,It has become common in some of the media to accuse the youth of the Islamic revival of being extremists and fundamentalists. What is your opinion of this?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Whatever the case, this is a mistake that has come from 
          the east and the west, from the Christians, communists and Jews, and 
          others who try to put people off the call to Allaah and its supporters, 
          and who want to be unfair to the da’wah by calling it extremism or fundamentalism 
          or whatever other names they give it.
 Undoubtedly calling people to Allaah is the religion 
          of the Messengers, it is their path and their way. The people of knowledge 
          are obliged to call others to Allaah and to be active in doing so. The 
          youth are obliged to fear Allaah and to adhere to the truth, not to 
          go to extremes or be harsh. It may so happen that some of the youth 
          are ignorant, so they go to extremes in some matters, or they are lacking 
          in knowledge, so they are negligent in some other matters. But all the 
          youth and others, such as the scholars, must fear Allaah and seek the 
          truth with evidence (daleel), i.e., what Allaah and His Messenger  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said; they must beware of 
          bid’ah (reprehensible innovations) and exaggeration. They must also 
          beware of ignorance and shortcomings. No one among them is infallible, 
          and some of the people may err by doing too much or by falling short. 
          But that does not mean that everyone is at fault; the fault rests with 
          those who make the mistake.
 But the enemies of Allaah among the Christians and 
          others who are following in their wake have made this a means of attacking 
          the da’wah and putting an end to it, by accusing its people of being 
          extremists and fundamentalists.
 What does “fundamentalism” mean?
 If they are fundamentalists in the sense that they 
          adhere to the fundamentals or basic principles (usool), to what Allaah 
          and His Messenger said, then this is praise,  not condemnation. 
          Adhering to the fundamentals, the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His 
          Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
          Allaah be upon him), is commendable and cannot be condemned. What is 
          to be condemned is when people overdo things or fall short, when they 
          go to extremes or are harsh or do not do what they have to do – this 
          is what is to be condemned. But the person who adheres to the right 
          principles, derived from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him), is not at fault; this is perfect and is to be praised. 
          This is what is obligatory upon seekers of knowledge and those who call 
          others to Allaah: they should adhere to the fundamentals from the Book 
          of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and whatever they know 
          of the basic principles of fiqh, ‘aqeedah and hadeeth, whatever can 
          be used as evidence (daleel). They have to have basic principles which 
          they follow. Describing the daayi’ahs as fundamentalists is a general 
          word which does not mean anything apart from condemning them and putting 
          people off. Fundamentalism is not a bad thing, in fact it is something 
          good.
 If the seeker of knowledge adheres to the fundamentals, 
          paying attention to them and staying up at night to study them from 
          the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and what the scholars have 
          stated, there is nothing wrong with that. But going to extremes in following 
          bid’ah is what is wrong, and going to extremes of ignorance and falling 
          short is also wrong.
 The daa’iyahs are obliged to adhere to the fundamentals 
          of sharee’ah and adhere to the middle course to which Allaah has guided 
          them, for Allaah has made them an ummah justly balanced (cf. Al-Baqarah 
          2:143). So the daa’iyahs have to be justly balanced, treading a middle 
          course between exaggeration and negligence. They have to be steadfast 
          in adhering to the truth, and to adhere to it on the basis of shar’i 
          evidence (daleel). There should be neither exaggeration nor negligence, 
          but the moderation that Allaah has enjoined.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), p. 233"
9432,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9432,Sihr and Its Types,"Is sihr (magic, witchcraft) real? Does it have any effect? What are the types of sihr?","Sihr is a serious crime and is one of the kinds of disbelief. Sihr is what the magicians do to delude and confuse people, so that the one who is watching thinks that it is real when in fact it is not.","Sihr: A serious crime


Meaning of sihr","Praise be to Allah.Sihr: A serious crime
Sihr is a serious crime and is one of the kinds of disbelief. It is one of the things with which people have been tested, in the past and currently, among the nations of the past, during the Jahiliyyah and in this ummah. 
The more ignorance increases, the less there is knowledge and awareness of faith, the less attention the authorities pay to this matter – the more the practitioners of sihr and trickery increase and spread in the land, to take the people’s wealth and confuse them and do other things. 
When knowledge prevails and faith increases, and the Islamic authorities are powerful, the number of these evil people shrinks and they move from one land to another, seeking a place where their falsehood will be accepted and they will be able to engage in their trickery and corruption. 
The Quran and Sunnah have described the kinds of sihr and the rulings on these matters. 
Sihr is so called because its means are hidden or secret, and because the practitioners of sihr deal with things in secret which enable them to perform illusions to confuse the people and deceive their eyes, and to cause them harm or steal their money, etc., in a secretive manner so that in most cases nobody realizes what is happening. 
Hence the last part of the night is called sahar, because at the end of the night people are unaware and they do not move about much. And the lungs are also called sahr, because they are hidden inside the body.  
Meaning of sihr
According to Sharie’ah, the meaning of sihr is what the magicians do to delude and confuse people, so that the one who is watching thinks that it is real when in fact it is not. As Allah said concerning the magicians of Pharaoh (interpretation of the meaning):
“They said: ‘O Musa! Either you throw first or we be the first to throw?’ Musa said: ‘Nay, throw you (first)!’ Then behold! their ropes and their sticks, by their magic , appeared to him as though they moved fast. So Musa conceived fear in himself. We (Allah) said: ‘Fear not! Surely, you will have the upper hand. And throw that which is in your right hand! It will swallow up that which they have made. That which they have made is only a magician’s trick, and the magician will never be successful, to whatever amount (of skill) he may attain.’” [Ta-Ha 20:65-69] 
Sihr may involve things that the magician does when tying knots on which he blows, as is referred to in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning):
“And from the evil of those who practise witchcraft when they blow in the knots.” [al-Falaq 113:4] 
And it may involve other things which they manage to do through the shayatin (devils), so they do things that may affect a man's reason or make him sick; they may cause division between a man and his wife, resulting in her looking ugly to him, or by making her hate her husband or be put off by him. This is blatant kufr as the Quran states. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“They followed what the Shayatin (devils) gave out (falsely of the magic) in the lifetime of Sulayman (Solomon). Sulayman did not disbelieve, but the Shayatin (devils) disbelieved, teaching men magic.” [al-Baqarah 2:102]
 Allah informs us that they (the shayatin) committed kufr by teaching men magic. Then He says (interpretation of the meaning):
 “and such things that came down at Babylon to the two angels, Harut and Marut, but neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, ‘We are for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).’”[al-Baqarah 2:102]
 Then Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
 “And from these (angels) people learn that by which they cause separation between man and his wife, but they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah’s Leave” [al-Baqarah 2:102] 
I.e., this magic and any harm that results from it is subject to the prior decree and will of Allah, for our Lord cannot be overwhelmed and nothing can happen in His Dominion against His Will. Nothing happens in this world or in the Hereafter except by His prior decree and His great wisdom, as He wills. So some people may be tested by sihr, and others may be tested by sickness, or by being killed…etc.  Allah is All-Wise in all that He wills and decrees, and in all that He prescribes for His slaves. Hence Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“but they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah’s Leave.” [al-Baqarah 2:102]
I.e., by His universal (kawni) will and decree, not by His legislative (shar’i) will [i.e., He wills that it should happen but He does not enjoin it and He is not pleased by such actions]. For shari’ah does not allow such things, indeed it forbids them, but by His universal leave He already knows and has already decreed that So and So will do sihr, and that So and So will be affected by sihr, just as He already knows and has already decreed that So and So will be killed, or afflicted with a certain sickness, or will die in a certain land, and will receive such and such provision, or will be rich or poor. All of that happens by the will and decree of Allah, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, We have created all things with Qadar (Divine Preordainments of all things before their creation as written in the Book of Decrees, Al-Lawh Al-Mahfooz."") [al-Qamar 54:49]
 “No calamity befalls on the earth or in yourselves but it is inscribed in the Book of Decrees (Al-Lawh Al-Mahfooz) before We bring it into existence. Verily, that is easy for Allah.” [al-Hadid 57:22]
 The evils that come at the hands of the magicians or others do not happen because our Lord is ignorant, for He knows all things and nothing at all is hidden from Him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, Allah is the All-Knower of everything.” [al-Anfal 8:75]
“that you may know that Allah has power over all things, and that Allâh surrounds all things in (His) Knowledge.” [al-Talaq 65:12]
So Allah knows all things, and nothing happens in His Dominion that He does not will, but He has perfect wisdom and good aims in whatever He decrees should happen to people of honour or humiliation, losing or gaining power, sickness or health, magic and other things. 
Everything that happens to people happens by the will of Allah and in accordance with His prior decree. These magicians may perform their illusions, as stated in the verse quoted above (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They said: ‘O Musa! Either you throw first or we be the first to throw?’ Musa said: ‘Nay, throw you (first)!’ Then behold! their ropes and their sticks, by their magic, appeared to him as though they moved fast.” [Ta-Ha 20:65-66]
It appeared to the onlooker as if these sticks and ropes were snakes, moving fast in the valley. They were only sticks and ropes, but the magicians, through what they had learned, made what they demonstrated before the people look different in their eyes to what it really was.
 Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“by their magic, appeared to him as though they moved fast.” [Ta-Ha 20:66]
And in Surah al-A’raf Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“He [Musa] said: ‘Throw you (first).’ So when they threw, they bewitched the eyes of the people, and struck terror into them, and they displayed a great magic.” [al-A’raf 7:116]
But in fact their sticks and ropes did not change; it was the people’s sight which changed because of the sihr, so they thought they were snakes, because of the illusion brought about by the magicians. Some people call this taqmir, which is when the magician does things to make a person not sense reality as it really is, so his eyes do not see what is really there and things may be taken from his shop or his home without him realizing it, i.e., he does not know what is really happening. So he may see a rock as a chicken or as an egg, and so on, because reality has been changed in his eyes because of the confusion wrought by the magician, and because his eyes have been bewitched. There are things that the magicians do with certain substances to make people’s eyes not see what is really happening. This is the kind of magic which Allah describes as “great” [i.e. serious, powerful] in Soorat al-A’raf (interpretation of the meaning):
“… So when they threw, they bewitched the eyes of the people, and struck terror into them, and they displayed a great magic.” [al-A’raf 7:116]

 And there are many aayaat with similar meanings.  
          
The Prophet  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Du’aa’ (supplication) is 
          a form of worship.” (Narrated by the four authors of Sunan 
          with a saheeh isnaad). And Muslim narrated in his Saheeh, 
          from Ameer al-Mu’mineen ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with 
          him) that the Prophet  (peace and 
          blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “He is cursed who offers sacrifices 
          to anyone other than Allaah.”  
What 
          is obligatory upon all of the Shi’ah and on everyone else is to worship 
          Allaah alone in sincerity, and to beware of calling upon anyone other 
          than Allaah for help, or of praying to the dead or absent, whether they 
          are from the Ahl al-Bayt or otherwise.  
It is also obligatory to avoid praying to or seeking the 
          help of inanimate objects such as idols, stars, etc., on the basis of 
          the same shar’i evidence (daleel) that we have mentioned above. 
The scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah, of the Sahaabah 
          and others, are unanimously agreed upon this matter. 
Secondly: what is the ruling on the sacrifices which are 
          offered in those places on these occasions? What is the ruling on the 
          drinks that are distributed in the streets and to the general public? 
          
The answer to this question is the same as the answer to 
          the first question, which is that it is a reprehensible bid’ah and it 
          is not permissible to take part in it, or to eat the meat of these sacrifices, 
          or to drink any of these drinks. If the sacrifices have been made to 
          anyone other than Allaah, from among the Ahl al-Bayt or anyone else, 
          this is major shirk, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
          
“Say 
          (O Muhammad): ‘Verily, my Salaah (prayer), my sacrifice, my living, 
          and my dying are for Allaah, the Lord of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinn 
          and all that exists).

9446,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9446,He prayed for three years without doing ghusl from janaabah,"When I reached the age of puberty, I did not know that ghusl was essential after having a wet dream. I stayed like that for three years, after which I learned that ghusl is obligatory. My question is, what do I have to do with regard to the prayers that I did during this period? Do I have to make them up?",,,"Praise be to Allah.When you find some semen in your clothes, you should do ghusl even if you do not remember having an erotic dream. When the Muslim wakes up and find some wetness – i.e., the traces of semen – on his clothes or on his thighs, or in the place where he was sleeping, he has to do ghusl even if he does not remember seeing an erotic dream. He has to do this because this emission of semen makes ghusl obligatory, regardless of whether he remembers the dream or not. If he remembers seeing an erotic dream but nothing came out of him, such as if you were to say that you dreamt that you were having intercourse with a woman, but when you woke up you found no trace of semen on your clothes or your body or the place where you were sleeping – do you have to do ghusl? In this case, ghusl is not obligatory, so long as there was no semen, even if you did have an erotic dream. Ghusl is connected to whether there is any semen emitted.
With regard to what you say about praying without doing ghusl for janaabah for three years, you and people in similar situations have to ask questions. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“So ask of those who know the Scripture, if you know not.” [al-Nahl 16:43].
You have no excuse before Allah, for He has given you good health and a sound mind, and He has commanded you to ask. It is not permissible for you to worship Allah in ignorance and misguidance. Worshipping Allah in ignorance and misguidance is the way of the Christians. Do you not recite Soorat al-Faatihah every day in your prayers? “Guide us to the Straight Way
The way of those on whom You have bestowed Your Grace, not (the way) of those who earned Your Anger, nor of those who went astray
[al-Faatihah 1:6-7 – interpretation of the meaning]
Those who have earned Allah’s anger are the Jews, who have knowledge but do not act upon it, and those who went astray are the Christians, who worship Allah in ignorance and misguidance. So if the Muslim worships Allah in ignorance and misguidance, he is one of those who have gone astray. One of the scholars said: whoever among our scholars becomes corrupt is like the Jews, and whoever among our worshippers becomes corrupt is like the Christians. So you have to fear Allah and remember that He is always watching. Do lots of naafil prayers. Some scholars suggest that you have to make up the prayers of these three years. But because what you did was due to ignorance and the number of prayers is too great, I hope that you will be OK in sha Allah. But do lots of naafil prayers, but if you think you can make up those prayers, this is what you should do anyway. But if you want to you can do a lot of naafil, as some scholars have suggested, because the issue is subject to debate. And Allah knows best.","Fataawa Samaahat al-Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Humayd, p. 64"

And what is the difference between Sadaqah and zakah?,Zakah means worshipping Allah by giving that which He has enjoined of different kinds of zakah to those who are entitled to them according to the guidelines of the Shari’ah.,"What is zakah?


What is sadaqah?


Difference between zakah and sadaqah","Praise be to Allah.What is zakah?
Zakah in Arabic means growth, blessing and purification. (See Lisan al-‘Arab, 14/358;, 2/399)
With regard to the shar’i definition, Zakah means worshipping Allah by giving that which He has enjoined of different kinds of zakah to those who are entitled to them, according to the guidelines prescribed in shari’ah. 
What is sadaqah?
Sadaqah comes from the word sidq (sincerity), i.e. it is a sign of sincerity of faith on the part of the person who gives it. (See Fath al-Qadir, 2/399) 
Sadaqah means worshipping Allah by giving money without that being made obligatory in shari’ah. The word sadaqah is sometimes used to refer to obligatory zakah. 
Difference between zakah and sadaqah
With regard to the difference between zakah and sadaqah, it is as follows: 

Zakah is enjoined in Islam on specific things, which are: gold, silver, crops, fruits, trade goods and an’am livestock, i.e., camels, cattle and sheep. 

With regard to sadaqah, it is not obligatory on any kind of wealth, rather it is what a person can give, without any specific limits or guidelines. 

Zakah is subject to the conditions that one full Hijri year has passed since acquiring the wealth, and that the wealth meets the minimum threshold (nisab), and it is a specific portion of wealth. 

Sadaqah is not subject to any conditions, and it may be given at any time, in any amount. 

Allah has enjoined that zakah be given to certain types of people , and it is not permissible to give it to anyone else. They are the people mentioned in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 

“As-Sadaqat (here it means Zakah) are only for the Fuqara (poor), and Al-Masakin (the poor) and those employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in debt; and for Allah’s Cause (i.e. for Mujahidun — those fighting in Allah’s cause), and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty imposed by Allah. And Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise” [al-Tawbah 9:60]
With regard to sadaqah, it may be given to those mentioned in the verse on zakah and to others.  

Whoever dies and owes zakah, his heirs must pay it from his wealth, and that takes precedence over the will (wasiyyah) and inheritance. 

As for sadaqah, there are no such obligations with regard to it. 

The one who withholds zakah is to be punished, as it says in the hadith narrated by Muslim in his Sahih (987) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no owner of treasure who does not pay his zakah, but it will be heated in the Fire of Hell and made into plates with which his sides and forehead will be branded until Allah passes judgement between His slaves on a Day the length of which will be like fifty thousand years, then he will see his path and whether it leads to Paradise or to Hell. And there is no owner of camels who does not pay zakah on them, but a soft sandy plain will be prepared for him and they will be made to step on him. Every time the last of them has gone the first of them will return, until Allah passes judgement between His slaves on a Day the length of which will be like fifty thousand years, then he will see his path and whether it leads to Paradise or to Hell. And there is no owner of sheep who does not pay zakah on them but a soft sandy plain will be prepared for him, and he will find none of them missing, with twisted horns or without horns or with broken horns, and they will be made to gore him with their horns and trample him with their hooves. Every time the last of them has gone the first of them will return, until Allah passes judgement between His slaves on a Day the length of which will be like fifty thousand years, then he will see his path and whether it leads to Paradise or to Hell…” 

With regard to sadaqah, the one who does not pay it will not be punished.  

According to the four schools of law, it is not permissible to give zakah to one’s ascendants or descendants . Ascendants include one’s mother, father, grandfathers and grandmothers ; descendants include one's children and their children. 

Sadaqah may be given to one's ascendants and descendants. 

It is not permissible to give zakah to one who is rich or who is strong and able to earn a living. 

‘Ubayd-Allah ibn ‘Adiyy said: Two men told me that they came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) during the Farewell Pilgrimage when he was distributing the zakah and asked him for some of it. He looked them up and down, and saw that they were strong and able-bodied. He said, “If you wish, I will give you some, but those who are rich or strong and able to earn have no share of it.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1633; al-Nasai, 2598; classed as sahih by Imam Ahmad and others.) (See Talkhis al-Habir, 3/108)
Sadaqah may be given to those who are rich and those who are strong and able to earn. 

In the case of zakah, it is better for it to be taken from the rich of a land and given to their poor. Many scholars are of the view that it is not permissible to send it to another country unless that serves an interest. 

But charity /sadaqah may be spent on those who are near and those who are far. 

It is not permissible to give zakah to kuffar and mushrikin. 

Sadaqah may be given to kuffar and mushrikin. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And they give food, in spite of their love for it (or for the love of Him), to the Miskin (the poor), the orphan, and the captive” [al-Insan 76:8]
Al-Qurtubi said: In dar al-Islam (the Muslim lands), a captive could only be a mushrik. 

It is not permissible for a Muslim to give zakah to his wife. Ibn al-Mundhir narrated that there was scholarly consensus on this point. 

But sadaqah may be given to one’s wife. 
These are some of the differences between zakah and sadaqah. 
Every good deed is a charity
The word sadaqah may also be applied to all kinds of good deeds . Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Sahih: “Chapter: every good deed is a charity /sadaqah” then he narrated from Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every good deed is a charity.” 
Ibn Battal said: “This hadith indicates that every good thing that a person does or says is recorded for him as an act of charity .” 
Al-Nawawi said: “The Prophet’s words “Every good deed is a charity” means that it is like charity in reward.”

    becoming Muslim, and is asking how she could perform the prayers at school","I am a teenager who is very interested in
      Islam. I am thinking of becoming a Muslim, but I do not know how I will be able to do the
      prayers at school. Please help me.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We thank you very much for sending this question to us,
    and we urge you to hasten to enter Islam, for Allaah does not accept any other religion.
    We also give you the glad tidings of a good future and good life if you enter this
    religion.
With regard to your question, we would like to answer it with another
    question, by which we do not mean anything silly or foolish:
If a student needs to go to the bathroom urgently during class, what
    does he do? The obvious answer is: he asks the teacher for permission and leaves the room.
Praying on time is more important than answering the call of nature. We
    would remind you of the following points:
Firstly: the times for prayer in Islam are long, praise be to Allaah.
    For example, the time for the Zuhr (midday) prayer – which is the prayer time which
    usually comes during the school day) does not end until the time for ‘Asr
    (mid-afternoon) prayer begins, so you can pray Zuhr from the time when the sun is at its
    zenith until the time when the shadow of an object is equal to its length. This time is a
    period of hours, not minutes, so there is bound to be an opportunity to pray within this
    time.
Secondly: there are usually breaks between classes; even if the break
    is only five minutes, you can make the most of it. There are also breaks for recess and
    for lunch during which you could pray. Otherwise you could pray after school is over and
    before the time for the prayer ends. Or you could ask the teacher for permission to leave
    before the class finishes so that you can go and pray. In some countries there are laws
    which enable the followers of different religions to practise the observances of their
    faiths at a specific time during the work or school day, so you could avail yourself of
    these laws if they exist.
Whatever the case, whoever fears Allaah and does his duty towards Him,
    Allaah will show him a way out and make things easier for him. When Allaah knows that a
    Muslim is keen to do the obligatory actions, He will help him. Finally, we would like to
    thank you once again for your question. We ask Allaah to guide you to the way of truth
    sooner rather than later, and to grant you good health and keep you safe and sound. May He
    grant you strength and success in your life and keep you safe from all evils.

    companions.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

""The Jews call 'Uzair (Ezra) a son of Allah...""
Please answer as thoroughly as possible and feel free to provide references to more detailed and extensive discussions of this matter (Arabic langu",,,"Praise be to Allah.When Allaah issued the command 
          to fight the Jews and Christians, in the aayah (interpretation of the 
          meaning):
“Fight 
          against those who (1) believe not in Allaah, (2) nor in the Last Day, 
          (3) nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allaah and His Messenger  
          (Muhammad), (4) and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth 
          (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), 
          until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and feel themselves 
          subdued” (al-Tawbah 9:29)
-- 
          He then stated the reason that made it obligatory to fight them, which 
          was their disbelief in Allaah and their shirk – which included their 
          speaking ill of Allaah by attributing a son to Him, when He is the One, 
          the Self-Sufficient Master, He begets not, nor was He begotten, and 
          there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him. The Jews said that ‘Uzayr 
          is a son of Allaah, and the Christians said that the Messiah was a son 
          of Allaah. ‘Uzayr was a righteous man from among the Children of Israel, 
          who was venerated by the Jews. It was said that the reason why he was 
          venerated was that he had memorized the Tawraat (Torah), so the Jews, 
          or some of them, exaggerated about him and claimed that he was a son 
          of Allaah. So Allaah condemned them for that and told them that by saying 
          this they were doing the same as the mushrikeen who said that the angels 
          were daughters of Allaah. The Christians also spoke ill of Allaah when 
          they said that the Messiah was a son of Allaah; by doing so they resembled 
          the Jews and mushrikeen. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
        
“And 
          the Jews say: ‘Uzair (Ezra) is the son of Allaah, and the Christians 
          say: Messiah is the son of Allaah. That is their saying with their mouths, 
          resembling the saying of those who disbelieved aforetime. Allaah’s Curse

What is the ruling on women going to this club, and what should their husbands do?

          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) urged women to stay in their 
          homes. When speaking about women going to the mosques, which are the 
          places of worship and shar’i knowledge, he said: “Do not prevent the 
          female slaves of Allaah from going to the mosques of Allaah, although

          words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And stay in your houses” [al-Ahzaab 33:33] 
 Moreover, if a woman gets used to that 
          she will form a strong attachment to it, because her emotions are so 
          strong. Then it will distract her from her religious and worldly duties, 
          and it will become all that she thinks and talks about. If a woman does 
          something like this, it will be a means of taking away her modesty, 
          and if a woman’s modesty is taken away from her, do not even ask about 
          the evil consequences that may follow, unless Allaah blesses her with

It doesn't matter if I say no, they believe they will be saving my soul. Are they even christians or some lower cult scum?

          to know with absolute certainty that the religion of Islam is the true 
          religion which is pleasing to Allaah, and that Allaah will accept no 
          other religion from anybody apart from Islam. Islam is based on the 
          worship of Allaah Alone with no partner or associate, and on following 
          the Messenger Muhammad  (peace and 
          blessings of Allaah be upon him). This is the implication of bearing 
          witness that there is no god except Allaah and that Muhammad is the 
          Messenger of Allaah.  
If these beliefs are firmly entrenched in 
          the heart of the Muslim, he will not care about any opposition or mockery 
          on the part of others. Rather he will pray to Allaah and act in accordance 
          with the religion of Allaah, and he will say, “I am one of the  
          Muslims.” Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): 
“And 
          who is better in speech than he who invites (men) to Allaah’s (Islamic 
          Monotheism), and does righteous deeds, and says: ‘I am one of the Muslims.’”

Who set up along

The Christians are among these mushrikeen 
          because they worship the Messiah and his mother, and they worship the 
          cross. So do not pay any attention to them or their mockery; turn away 
          from them and do not enter into debate with them, lest they make you 
          confused with their specious arguments. If you can change schools and

 The Mormon sect appears to be Christian 
          because they mention their book, which is the Gospel (New Testament), 
          and they say that if Islam were like this, i.e., opposing their religion, 
          it would have refuted their book. This is ignorance and confusion on 
          their part, for Islam does not refute the Injeel which Allaah revealed 
          to ‘Eesa; in fact the Qur’aan confirms it and the Books that came before 
          it. But Islam refutes the religion of the Christians who have taken 
          the Messiah and his mother as gods instead of Allaah, and Islam refutes 
          the distorted Gospels which are in the Christians’ hands. Allaah says, 
          after mentioning the Tawraat  (Torah) and Injeel (Gospel): 
“And 
          We have sent down to you (O Muhammad) the Book (this Qur’aan) in truth, 
          confirming the Scripture that came before it” 
[al-Maa’idah 5:48] 
          
i.e., the Qur’aan confirms the Books which came before 
          it, such as the Tawraat and Injeel.
The Messiah has disowned these mushrik 
          Christians and their way, and he will disown them on the Day of Resurrection, 
          as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Surely, 
          they have disbelieved who say: ‘Allaah is the Messiah [‘Eesa (Jesus)], 
          son of Maryam (Mary).’ But the Messiah [‘Eesa (Jesus)] said: ‘O Children 
          of Israel! Worship Allaah, my Lord and your Lord.’” 
[al-Maa’idah 5:72]
“And 
          (remember) when Allaah will say (on the Day of Resurrection): ‘O ‘Eesa 
          (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)! Did you say unto men: ‘Worship me and 
          my mother as two gods besides Allaah?’  He will say: ‘Glory be 
          to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right (to say). Had I 
          said such a thing, You would surely have known it. You know what is

do you have any hadith towards this issue? the mother after getting married with another brother kept the custody of the children.
by the law of the land i will get the full custody ; however i fear ALLH(swt) and i do not want to go against shariah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
It is better for a woman to be patient and put up with her husband, especially if they have children. No household is free from arguments. But if her husband is mistreating her very badly and she cannot bear it, then she may get divorced. 
Secondly: 
If a woman gets divorced by talaaq then her ‘iddah lasts for three menstrual cycles. But she is gets divorced by khula’, then her ‘iddah is just one menstrual cycle. It is haraam to propose marriage to her whilst she is still in ‘iddah. 
Thirdly: 
Sharee’ah states that if the spouses separate, the mother has more right to custody of the children than the father, but if she remarries she loses her right to custody. The evidence for that is the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to that woman who asked for custody of her child from her husband – after he had divorced her – “You have more right to that so long as you do not get married.” 
Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2276 from the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him); classed as hasan by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 1991. 
The hadeeth indicates that the woman has more right to custody of her children than her husband, unless she gets married, in which case he has more right. 
Our advice to this sister is that she should think long and hard before she asks for divorce or khula’. If you are able to be patient and put up with your husband’s annoyance, and the problems between you can be resolved by mutual understanding and agreement, then this is better. But if you cannot stand to live with him, this is something that only you can decide. 
If they separate and the woman has to choose between her children and another husband, then she should pray istikhaarah, seek the help of Allah and turn to Him in du’aa’ and supplication, asking Him to guide her to the right decision. This is the Islamic ruling concerning this matter. 
If the law of your country states that the mother gets custody of the children even if she remarries, this is contrary to the rules of sharee’ah, and that is not permissible. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

I hope that you can explain the Islamic rulings on these matters. Is there any difference between holding the Eid prayers in the mosque or in the Eid prayer-place?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Sunnah for the one who comes to the Eid prayer-place to pray the Eid prayers or to offer prayers for rain, is to sit down and not pray Tahiyyat al-Masjid (two rak’ahs to greet the mosque), because it is not narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or his companions did that, as far as we know. But if the prayer is being held in a mosque, then he should pray Tahiyyat al-Masjid, because of the general applicability of the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “When any one of you enters the mosque, let him not sit down until he has prayed two rak’ahs.” (Saheeh, agreed upon).
 What is prescribed for the one who sits down to await the Eid prayer is to recite a lot of Tahleel (saying Laa ilaaha ill-Allah) and Takbir (saying Allahu akbar), because these are the slogans of this day, and this is the Sunnah for all of those who are inside the mosque or outside of it, until the khutbah is over.

9465,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9465,Why is it forbidden for a man and a woman who are not mahrams to have a relationship?,Why can't a Muslim date?  I'm an extremely strict Christian but I have Muslim friend who I'm trying to understand.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Islam forbids a man to be alone with a non-mahram woman (one who is not his wife or a close relative) even if he is teaching her the Quran, which is the Book of Allah, That is because the Shaytaan (Satan) would come between them. The Prophet of Islam (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No man is alone with a woman but the Shaytaan will be the third one present.” If this woman wants to hear about Islam and read about it in detail, she can look at books about Islam that have been translated into different languages, so she can take the language that she understands, then if she understands what attracts her to Islam, she can become Muslim. If she does not understand something and wants someone to explain it to her, it is permissible (for her to speak to a man) so long as there is no khulwah (being alone with a member of the opposite sex) involved – so she could have a mahram (close relative) with her, or a group of women, and the man should be a trustworthy Muslim, or a group of trustworthy men who could sit with this woman and teach her about Islam so that she can understand it and proof be established for her. This is permitted.
Shaykh ‘Abd-Allah ibn Jibreen
Allah wants to make the Muslims pure, hence He forbade them all means that may lead to evil, immorality and obscenity. You know that if a man is alone with a woman and starts a relationship with her, this relationship often leads to bad consequences, and that being alone with a member of the opposite sex is the way to immorality and fornication. It is not permissible for a man to praise himself and say, “I will be not affected by being alone with a woman.” Islam does not allow the opportunity for things to get out hand; it keeps people away from the steps that might lead to that in the first place. The rulings of sharee’ah were revealed for all people, it is not the point that there are cases of khulwah which do not lead to haraam actions such as touching and kissing. Why should a person expose himself to temptation?
Is it not the truth that if a man is alone with a non-mahram woman and there is no one else present, that something may cross the mind of either of them, even if nothing actually happens. But frequent meetings may indeed lead to something happening.
In this case, sharee’ah closes all doors that may lead to evil.
If a woman needs to speak to a man for a genuine reason, or vice versa, then that may be achieved by sending letters, without having to meet, or they may meet from behind a screen, or in the presence of others so that no khulwah will be involved. This is provided that both are modest and wear concealing garments.

9466,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9466,What is moderation in religion?,What is meant by moderation in religion?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Moderation in religion means that one does not exaggerate and go beyond the limit set by Allaah, and that one does not neglect it and fall short of the limit set by Allaah.
Moderation in religion means following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Exaggeration means trying to do more than he did, and negligence means not reaching that level.
For example, a man says, “I want to spend all night in prayer (qiyaam al-layl), and never sleep all my life, because prayer is one of the best acts of worship, so I want to spend the entire night in prayer.” We say, this is going to extremes in the religion of Allaah, and this is not right. Something like this happened at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), when a group of men got together and one of them said, “I will pray at night and never sleep.” Another said, “I will fast and never break my fast.” The third one said, “I will never marry women.” News of that reached the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he said, “What is wrong with people who say such and such? I fast and I break my fast. I sleep, and I marry women. Whoever overlooks my Sunnah does not belong to me.” These people had gone to extremes in religion, and so the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) disowned them, because they overlooked his Sunnah which includes fasting and not fasting, praying at night and sleeping, and marrying women.
The one who is falling short is one who says, “I do not need to do voluntary (naafil) actions, so I will not do them. I will only do the fard actions. He may even be falling short in the fard actions, so this person is lacking.
The moderate person is one who follows the path of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his rightly-guided successors (al-Khulafaa’ al-Raashidoon).
Another example: three men are faced with an immoral man. One of them says, “I will not greet this immoral man and I will boycott him, keep away from him and not speak to him.”
The second one says, “I will go with this immoral man, greet him and smile at him. I will invite him to my place and accept his invitation. He is just like any righteous man to me.”
The third one says, “I hate this immoral man for his immoral actions, but I love him for his faith. I will not boycott him unless doing so is in his best interests. If there is nothing to be gained by boycotting him, and if that will only increase him in his immorality, then I will not boycott him.”
We say that the first man is going to extremes, the second is negligent and the third is moderate.
The same applies to all other acts of worship and dealings with others. People vary between extremism, negligence and moderation.
A third example: A man is a prisoner of his wife, who directs him as she wishes and he does not stop her from committing sin, or urge her to do good. She has taken over his reason and has become the one who is in charge of him.
Another man treats his wife in a harsh, arrogant and high-handed manner. He does not care about her and regards her as less than a servant.
A third man is moderate in his dealings with his wife, as Allaah and His Messenger commanded.
“And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable”
[al-Baqarah 2:228 – interpretation of the meaning]
[The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:] “Let no believing man hate a believing woman. If he dislikes one of her characteristics he will be pleased with another.”
This last man is the one who is moderate. The second one is extreme in his dealings with his wife, and the first is falling short.
The same applies to all other deeds and acts of worship.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il li Fadeelat al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, vol. 1, p. 42"
9473,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9473,Exemption of (baby) dolls from the ruling on haram images,"I have read all your answers regarding pictures for children.  In my home, we have no pictures or animate (2-D and 3-D) figures, apart from these for children. In answering a question about photos, you stated no 3-dimensional images were allowed.  Can you please explain the tradition where Aisha (May Allah be pleased with her) had a small toy unicorn (or similar) that she played with as a child, and the Prophet did not stop her. 
Please answer this question, as all practising muslims I know have toys for their children.  We all seek the right path of Islam.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Those toys which are made of wool are not considered to be images, because they do not have a head apart from a piece of wool, and it does not have the features of the face such as eyes, nose, mouth or ears. If an image does not have a head or any facial features, it is exempt from the ruling prohibiting images.
Even if we assume that it is an image, this does not mean that all images are permitted. Rather it is an exemption from the prohibition for a legitimate shar’i purpose, which is to teach girls how to care for babies and to develop maternal feelings in their hearts, in order to prepare them for the future.
Most of the scholars have exempted the making of girls’ toys from the prohibition on making images and statues. This is the view of the Maalikis, Shaafa’is and Hanbalis. Al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad narrated that most of the scholars said that this is permissible, and he was followed in that by al-Nawawi in his commentary on Muslim. He said: “Exempted from the prohibition on making images that have a shadow are things that are used as toys for girls, because of the exemption that was narrated concerning that. This means that it is permissible, whether they are toys in the shape of people or animals, three-dimensional or otherwise, and whether they are supposed to represent real animals or not, such as a horse with wings…
The majority of scholars quote as evidence for this exemption the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) in which she says:
“I used to play with dolls in the house of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). I had friends who used to play with me. When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came in, they would hide themselves, then he would call them to join me and play with me.”
According to another report, she said that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came back from the battle of Tabook or Khaybar, and there was a curtain in her alcove. The wind blew and lifted the curtain, showing some dolls with which ‘Aa’ishah was playing. He said, “What is this, O ‘Aa’ishah?” She said, “My daughters.” Among them he saw a mare with wings made of leather.” He said, ‘And what is this that I see in the midst of them?” She said, “A mare.” He said, “What is this on it?” She said, “Wings.” He said, “A mare with wings?” She said, “Have you not heard that Sulaymaan had a horse with wings?” She said, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) smiled so broadly that I could see his eyeteeth.
The Maalikis, Shaafa’is and Hanbalis interpreted this as an exemption for making toys because of the necessity of educating girls in how to bring up children. This interpretation is obvious if the toy is in the form of a human, but it is not obvious if it is in the form of a horse with wings. Hence al-Haleemi used this report and others to support his argument. He said: “There are two benefits of that in the case of girls, one immediate and one which comes later. The immediate benefit is that they have fun, which is one of the most effective means of child development. If a child is well taken care of and feels happy and content, his development will be stronger and better. That is because joy energizes the mind, which in turn energizes the soul, and that has an effect on the body and produces physical strength. The benefit which is seen later on is that through that (play), the girls learn how to deal with children, love them and feel compassion for them, and that becomes second nature to them, so that when they grow up and see for themselves the things they used to play at, they will find that the compassion they used to play at is something very real indeed. Ibn Hajar quoted in al-Fath from someone who thought that making toys was haram, and that it had been permitted at first but was then abrogated by the general prohibition on making images. He responded by noting that the abrogation could have been the other way round and that the permission to make toys came later, on the grounds that in the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) about her toys, there is the indication that this happened at a later date, because it mentions that this happened when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came back from Tabook. So the apparent meaning is that it happened later on. (al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah – Maaddat al-Tasweer)",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
9476,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9476,When did the adhaan begin?,"I heard that the Islamic call to prayer (adhaan) was known from the
      time of Ibraaheem al-Khaleel (peace be upon him), because Allaah says in
      His Book (interpretation of the meaning): “And proclaim [adhdhin] to
      mankind the Hajj (pilgrimage)” [al-Hajj 22:27]. Is this correct?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Some
      people do say that, and some even say that the adhaan was known to all the
      Prophets from the time that Adam (peace be upon him) came down to this
      earth. Some of them say that it was known to Prophet Ibraaheem when his
      Lord said to him (interpretation of the meaning): “And proclaim
      [adhdhin] to mankind the Hajj (pilgrimage). They will come to you on foot
      and on every lean camel” [al-Hajj 22:27]. This is a strange thing to
      say and it is not correct. 
The
      correct view is that the adhaan was prescribed during the time of the
      Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in
      al-Madeenah al-Munawwarah, not in Makkah and not during the Israa’ as
      was narrated in some da’eef (weak) ahaadeeth. 
Ibn
      Hajar says:
One
      of the strangest things that was narrated concerning the beginning of the
      adhaan was the report of Abu’l-Shaykh, whose isnaad contains someone who
      is majhool (unknown), from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Zubayr, according
      to which he said, “The adhaan was taken from the adhaan of Ibraaheem, “And
      proclaim [adhdhin] to mankind the Hajj (pilgrimage)” [al-Hajj 22:27].
      So the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
      him) gave the adhaan. (al-Fath,
      2/280).
The (report about) the adhaan of Adam
      is also da’eef (weak). Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy upon him) said:
 What
      was reported by Abu Na’eem in al-Hilyah about Jibreel calling out
      the adhaan to Adam when he came down from Paradise has an isnaad which
      contains people who are majhool (unknown). (al-Fath, 2/280).
The
      saheeh evidence indicates that the adhaan was first prescribed during the
      time of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in
      Madeenah. Among these reports are the following:
 It
      was reported from Naafi’ that Ibn ‘Umar used to say: when the Muslims
      came to Madeenah, they used to come together and try to find out if the
      time for prayer had come, for there was no call to prayer. One day they
      were talking about that and some of them said, Let us use a bell like the
      bell of the Christians. Others said, Let us use a horn like the horn of
      the Jews. ‘Umar said, Let us send a man to call us to prayer. The
      Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said,
      “O Bilaal, get up and call the people to prayer.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 569).
 It
      was reported from Abu ‘Umayr ibn Anas from his paternal uncles among the
      Ansaar: the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was
      concerned about the prayer and how he could bring the people together to
      pray. It was said to him, Raise a flag when the time for prayer comes, and
      when they see it they will call one another – but he did not like this
      idea. Then the ram’s horn or shofar was suggested to him. Ziyaad said,
      the shofar of the Jews. But he did not like this idea, and said, “This
      belongs to the Jews.” A bell was suggested to him, but he said, “This
      belongs to the Christians.” ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Zayd ibn ‘Abd Rabbihi
      went away, thinking about the concern of the Messenger of Allaah 
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He saw the adhaan in a dream,
      and the next morning he came to the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and
      blessings of Allaah be upon him) and told him about it. He said, “O
      Messenger of Allaah, whilst I was half-asleep, someone came to me and
      showed me the adhaan. ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with
      him) had also seen it before that, but he kept quiet for twenty days. Then
      he told the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who
      said to him, “What stopped you from telling me about it?” he said, “
      ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Zayd beat me to it, and I felt shy.” The Messenger of
      Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “O Bilaal,
      get up and see what ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Zayd tells you to do, and do it.”
      So Bilaal gave the adhaan. (Narrated
      by Abu Dawood – may Allaah have mercy on him – in his Sunan,
      420).
 According
      to a report narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Zayd: when the Messenger of
      Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded that a
      bell should be made so that it could be used to tell the people to gather
      for prayer, I had a dream in which I saw a man carrying a bell in his
      hand. I said, “O slave of Allaah, will you sell that bell?” he said,
      “What will you do with it?” I said, “We will call the people to
      prayer with it.” He said, “Shall I not show you something better than
      that?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “Say, Allaahu akbar Allaah
      akbar, Allaahu akbar Allaahu akbar, ash-hadu an laa ilaaha ill-Allaah,

      a short distance away from me, and said, “When the prayer is about to

      prayer is about to begin. Allaah is most Great, Allaah is most Great.
      There is no god but Allaah).” When morning came, I went to the Messenger
      of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and told him
      what I had seen. He said, “This is a true dream, in sha Allaah. Get up
      with Bilaal and tell him what you have seen, so that he can give the call,
      because he has a more beautiful voice than you.” So I got up with Bilaal
      and started telling him what I had seen, and he gave the call to prayer.
      ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab heard that whilst he was in his house, and he came
      out, dragging his cloak behind him, saying, “By the One Who sent you
      with the truth, O Messenger of Allaah, I saw the same as he saw.” The
      Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
      “To Allaah be praise.” (Narrated
      by Abu Dawood, 499).
These
      ahaadeeth indicate that the adhaan was first prescribed during the time of

“Who disobey not, (from executing) the commands they receive from Allah, but do that which they are commanded.” [66:6 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Belief in the angels implies four essential things: 
1 – Affirming that they exist and that they are part of the creation of Allah, subject to His Lordship and subjugated to Him. 
“…honoured slaves.
They speak not until He has spoken, and they act on His command” [21:26-27 – interpretation of the meaning] 
“Who disobey not, (from executing) the commands they receive from Allah, but do that which they are commanded.” [66:6 – interpretation of the meaning] 
“And those who are near Him (i.e. the angels) are not too proud to worship Him, nor are they weary (of His worship).
They (i.e. the angels) glorify His praises night and day, (and) they never slacken (to do so).” [21:19-20 – interpretation of the meaning] 
2 – Belief in the names of those whose name we know, such as Jibreel, Mikail, Israfil, Malik, Radwan and others – peace be upon them. 
3 – Belief in the attributes of those whose attributes we know, as we know the description of Jibreel (peace be upon him) from the sunnah (prophetic teachings), and that he has six hundred wings which filled the horizon or the sky. 
4 – Belief in the actions which we know some of them do, so Jibreel (peace be upon him) was entrusted with that which revives the heart, namely the revelation. Israfil (peace be upon him) is entrusted with sounding the trumpet-blast (to herald the onset of the Day of Resurrection); Mikail (peace be upon him) is entrusted with the rain; Malik (peace be upon him) is entrusted with Hell, and so on. 
One of the most important things that we must believe in is that every person has two angels with him who record his deeds. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“(Remember) that the two receivers (recording angels) receive (each human being), one sitting on the right and one on the left (to note his or her actions).
Not a word does he (or she) utter but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it).” [50:17-18] 
i.e., a watcher from among these angels who is present. So beware lest these two angels record anything from you that will be bad for you on the Day of Resurrection, for everything that you say will be recorded against you, and when the Day of Resurrection comes, each person’s book of deeds will be brought out. 
“… and on the Day of Resurrection, We shall bring out for him a book which he will find wide open.
(It will be said to him): ‘Read your book. You yourself are sufficient as a reckoner against you this Day.’” [17:13-14 – interpretation of the meaning].

It is not permissible to eat the food that has been prepared for this occasion. Their claim that the food for the birthday celebration is for the guests does not make it excusable to eat it. Hospitality is subject to its own rulings, and matters are judged according to the intentions behind them. It is very clear that the food is being prepared for this innovated occasion, and eating this food is one of the things that helps them to persist in doing this. It is a kind of co-operation in sin and transgression. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

9488,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9488,The meaning of the hadeeth which says that the sins of the Muslims will be placed on the kuffaar of the People of the Book,"We would like you to please explain for us the hadeeth qudsi that follows (some say that how can this be since there is injustive involved-wa 'iyaadhu billaah):  

In a book entitled 110 Hadith Qudsi, translated by Syed Masood-ul-Hasan, Revision and Commentaries by Ibrahim M. Kunna, published by Darussalam, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in 1996/1417H, appears a Qudsi Hadith No. 8 on page 19/20. 

No. 8:    Narrated Abu Musa (r.a.): Allah's Messenger (s.a.s.) said:  

On the Day of Resurrection, my Ummah (nation) will be gathered into three groups, one sort will enter Paradise without rendering an account (of their deeds). Another sort will be reckoned on easy account and admitted into Paradise. Yet another sort will come bearing on their backs heaps of sins like great mountains. Allah will ask the angels though He knows best about them: Who are these people? They will reply: They are humble slaves of yours. He will say: Unload the sins from them and put the same over the Jews and Christians; then let the humble slaves get into Paradise by virtue of My Mercy. (This Hadith is sound and mentioned in Mustadrak of Hakim).  

Please help us ya shaykh to clarify the meaning of this hadeeth. We are doing as Allaah commanded us (meaning):ask those of knowledge if you do not know",,,"Praise be to Allah.This hadeeth is to be found 
          in Saheeh Muslim (2767), 
          narrated from Abu Moosa (may Allaah be pleased with him) from the Prophet 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him), who said: “On the Day of Resurrection, some of the Muslims 
          will come with sins like mountains, but Allaah will forgive them and 
          will put them (the sins) onto the Jews and Christians.” So this hadeeth 
          is saheeh.  
With regard to its meaning, al-Nawawi 
          said in his commentary: “The meaning of this hadeeth is the same as 
          the hadeeth narrated by Abu Hurayrah: “For each person there is a place 
          in Paradise and a place in Hell.” When the believer enters Paradise, 
          his place in Hell is taken over by the kaafir because he deserves that 
          because of his kufr. The meaning of the phrase “your ransom from the 
          Fire” is that you could have entered Hell, but this is your ransom because 
          Allaah has decreed a certain number to fill it; when the kuffaar enter 
          Hell because of their kufr and sins, this is like a ransom for the Muslims. 
          With regard to the report, “On the Day of Resurrection, some of the 
          Muslims will come with sins” – Allaah will forgive the Muslims these 
          sins and will absolve them of them, and He will put the like of those 
          sins onto the Jews and Christians because of their kufr and sins. So 
          they will enter Hell because of their own actions, not because of the 
          sins of the Muslims. This report has to be interpreted in this manner, 
          because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And 
          no bearer of burdens shall bear another’s burden” [Faatir 35:18]   
          
It may be that the meaning 
          is: sins which the kuffaar innovated and initiated, because whoever 
          starts a bad thing will bear a burden of sin like that of each person 
          who does that thing.",Shaykh Sa’d al-Humayd
9496,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9496,Ruling on working as a defence lawyer,"When working as a defence lawyer, one may have to support and defend evil, because the defence lawyer tries to prove the innocence of the guilty person whom he is defending. Is the income of a defence lawyer who does that haraam? Are there any Islamic conditions attached to a person working as a defence lawyer?",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          Defence also means protection, and if 
          a person defends and protects evil then undoubtedly this is haraam, 
          because it means that he is falling into that which Allaah has forbidden:
 
          “but do not help one another in sin and 
          transgression”
 
          [al-Maa'idah 5:2 – interpretation of 
          the meaning]
 
          But if he protects and defends good, then this is a praiseworthy 
          kind of protection as enjoined in the aayah:
 
          “Help you one another in Al‑Birr 
          and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety)”
 
          [al-Maa'idah 5:2 – interpretation of 
          the meaning]
 
          On this basis, whoever has prepared himself 
          to do that must, before taking on a specific case, examine and study 
          it. If the one who is asking for his defence is in the right, then he 
          should take on the case and support the truth and the one who is in 
          the right; if the one who is asking for his defence is not in the right 
          then he may also indulge in a case of that nature but the lawyer may 
          go against the wishes of the one who is seeking his defence in the sense 
          that he is protecting this person to prevent him from falling into anything 
          that Allaah has forbidden, and he does not defend him in the way that 
          he wants. That is because the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) said: “Help your brother whether he is a wrongdoer or one 
          to whom wrong is done.” They said, “O Messenger of Allaah, (we know 
          what it means to help) the one to whom wrong is done, but how can we 
          help him if he is a wrongdoer?” He said, “Stop him from doing wrong 
          to others, that is how you will help him.”
 
          If he knows that the one who is seeking 
          his protection has no rights then he must advise him and warn him and 
          put him off getting involved in this case; he should explain to him 
          what is wrong with his claim so that he will give it up out of conviction.","Majallat al-Da’wah no. 1789, p. 61"
9497,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9497,"Her husband has changed completely and treats her differently, and he commits haraam deeds; what should she do?","I am a woman who has been married for ten years, and I have two sons and a daughter. It was not a love marriage, but I loved my husband very much, because in the beginning he respected me and used to discuss all his affairs with me, and he used to speak words of love to me until I came to love him very dearly. In fact, he used to pray in the mosque and help me with everything, with raising the children and with housework. But after four years of marriage he began to make friends with some other guys, and by accident I found out that he was smoking shisha. I was very upset when I found out about that, and he promised me that he would never do it again, but unfortunately he still smokes shisha and he is so addicted to it that he goes to the cafe in the morning to smoke it. When I tried to stop him, he screamed in my face that I should not interfere in his business. Please note that he is not taking proper care of me and his children, and he has become very busy with his friends, to the extent that when he goes out in the morning, he does not come back until late at night. I tried to get his family to intervene in this matter, but to no avail, because he does not listen to anyone. I am very confused about my situation. He is very irritable with me, but with his friends he laughs and jokes. When I ask him to let us go out together, he does not agree, and if we do go out, he is silent all the time and does not speak, and he is busy with his phone, either with messages or returning calls, to the extent that at first I thought that he was in a relationship with another woman, but from his behaviour I think that he is only busy with his friends. I love him dearly and want him with all my heart. Please note that he used to pray in the mosque, but now the times for prayer come and go without him praying. He hurts my feelings a great deal and puts me down; he screams in my face in front of the children and in front of other people, with no consideration for my feelings. He often takes trips with his friends, and is addicted to shisha, and he spends too much on his clothes and trying to look smart, but he does not pay any attention to what we need in the house or what the children need. He has a lot of debts and does not own anything of any value. Please note that I work and spend on myself, and I pay the rent and pay the servant’s wages, and pay for many of the household expenses, but he does not care. How should I deal with him?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly:
Marital problems are very common. If the problems stem from the husband, then the wise woman must look for the reasons why her husband’s behaviour towards her has changed, and the reasons why he is causing trouble for her. She may not be listening to him and being stubborn in her dealings with him, or she may be falling short in obeying him, or she may be neglectful regarding the house and raising her children, and so on. It cannot be imagined that a couple would have a happy married life, then things turn upside down suddenly and the husband begins to hate his wife and like to stay out at night, smoking shisha and so on, unless there are reasons that push the husband to do such things, although we know that in many instances the wife has nothing to do with that – rather it is a kind of upheaval that a man goes through after having been steadfast; we ask Allah to keep us steadfast and guide us – or it could be because of bad company, until his friends lead him astray from the straight path of his Lord and distract him from taking care of his best interests in this world and the hereafter, as appears to be the case here.
If it becomes clear to the wife that she has nothing to do with the changes in her husband, then this is a test for her from Allah, so she must choose between bearing with patience what her husband is doing, whilst continuing to advise him and pray for him, or seeking divorce, if she cannot put up with his mistreatment, or if she fears for herself or her religious commitment or her children if she stays with him, or if his sin reaches the level of disbelief, Allah forbid.
Secondly:
The wife must do her utmost to advise her husband and remind him, in the way that is best. She should not speak harshly to him or frown at him; rather she should speak gently to him and treat him kindly. She should also speak to her family so that they can find a good person who is close to him and can advise him, remind him and point him in the right direction. At the same time, she should be keen to offer supplication when prostrating and at the end of the night, asking her Lord to guide him.
Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allah preserve him) said:
It is not permissible for the husband to mistreat his wife, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Treat them [women] with kindness” [an-Nisaa’ 4:19]. And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Your wife has rights over you.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari from the hadith of ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas. If he mistreats her, then she should respond with patience and do her duty towards him, so that she will have the reward for that, and in the hope that Allah may guide him. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And not equal are the good deed and the bad. Repel [evil] by that [deed] which is better; and thereupon the one whom between you and him is enmity [will become] as though he was a devoted friend” [Fussilat 41:34].
Al-Muntaqa min Fataawa ash-Shaykh al-Fawzaan (4/177).
Although there may be some sins that he is committing, and his wife may be able to put up with that, his forsaking prayer does not come under that heading, because forsaking prayer constitutes disbelief (kufr) and apostasy, so she should not allow him to be intimate with her unless he starts to pray again.
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:
There is a woman who is married to a man who commits some sins, including major sins, such as taking drugs and the like, and she is suffering because of this man. She is a righteous and believing woman – we think she is like that, but Allah knows best. What should this woman do, given that she has tried to advise and guide him to give up this haraam deed and to turn back to Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, but to no avail? What do you think? Should she go to her family or should she continue to put up with it in the hope that Allah might guide him? He also prevents his children from praying.
Answer: This man who does haraam deeds – does he pray or not?
Questioner: He prays but is not very serious about it. Sometimes he prays at home, sometimes he prays at work, and sometimes he delays the prayer.
Answer: I think that if she has tried to advise him without success, then she has the right to seek an annulment of the marriage, but in a situation like that there may be other issues that make it not possible to ask for annulment, because she has children and annulment of the marriage may lead to further troubles. So if his sin does not reach the level of disbelief (kufr), there is no blame on her if she stays with him, for fear of further problems. But if his sin does reach the level of disbelief, such as if he does not pray at all, then she should not stay with him a minute longer.
Liqaa’aat al-Baab al-Maftooh (13/question no. 18).
Thirdly:
Husbands should fear Allah, may He be exalted, with regard to their wives, and they should realise that Allah, may He be exalted, has commanded them to treat their wives with kindness and has instructed them to keep them in an acceptable manner. He has told them that a man may dislike his wife, yet Allah has instilled much good in her. Likewise, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) stated that if the husband dislikes one characteristic in his wife, he may be pleased with what she has of other, good characteristics.
 Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Treat them with kindness even if you dislike them; it is quite possible that you dislike something in which Allah has placed much good” [an-Nisaa’ 4:19].
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “No believing man should hate a believing woman. If he dislikes one of her characteristics, he may be pleased with another.” Narrated by Muslim (1469).
These husbands should realise that their example is the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he was the best husband to his wives.
Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
The words “Treat them [women] with kindness” [an-Nisaa’ 4:19] mean: speak nicely to them, treat them kindly, make yourself look good for them as much as you can, just as you would like them to do for you. So treat (your wife) as you would like to be treated. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “And due to the wives is similar to what is expected of them, according to what is reasonable” [al-Baqarah 2:228]. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of you are those who are best to their wives, and I am the best of you to my wives.” Narrated and classed as saheeh by at-Tirmidhi (3892). It was in his character (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to be kind to people; he was always cheerful; he would joke with his wives, treat them kindly, spend generously on them and laugh with them. He even raced with ‘Aa’ishah the Mother of the Believers, as an act of kindness and affection towards her. She said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) raced with me and I beat him, but that was before I put on weight. Then when I had put on weight, I raced with him again and he beat me, and said: “This is in return for that.” Narrated by Abu Daawood (2578); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Daawood. His wives would gather every night in the house of the one with whom the Messenger of Allah (sa) (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) was going to spend that night, and sometimes he would eat supper with them, then each of them would go back to her own house. He used to sleep with his wife under one blanket, taking off his upper garment and sleeping in his lower garment. When he had prayed ‘Ishaa’, he would stay up for a while with his wives, before going to sleep, thus comforting them and putting them at ease. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern (example)” [al-Ahzaab 33:21].
Tafseer Ibn Katheer (2/242)
Perhaps a large part of the remedy is trying to keep him away from the bad friends who have distracted him from his home, his family and his religion. If you can seek help with that from righteous people in his family, so that he will have no need of the bad friends who caused him to change, then that is good.
You must also seek the help of Allah, so that your husband will find compensation for those bad companions in the comfort, love and mercy that you create at home, in the hope that Allah will grant you and your husband relief and a way out from this test.
We ask Allah to guide your husband and enable him to seek His pleasure, and to bring about reconciliation between you.
