    The Muslim should be serious in his life and keep himself 
    busy with that for which he was created, which is the worship of Allaah 
    alone. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And I (Allaah) created not the jinn and mankind except 
    that they should worship Me (Alone)”[al-Dhaariyaat 51:26]

    He should have nothing to do with these matters which harm 
    him in both spiritual and worldly terms and distract him from that which is 
    in his best interests in this world and in the Hereafter. The basic 
    guideline concerning permissible things according to the scholars is that 
    whatever distracts one from obligatory duties or becomes a means of 
    committing forbidden actions; thereby becomes haraam. As for things that 
    distract one from doing things that are mustahabb but are not a means of 
    committing haraam actions, then they are makrooh. Whatever does not distract 
    from either obligatory duties or mustahabb actions is permissible in 
    principle. Whoever looks at those who support sports teams will find that 
    they devote all their time and energy to supporting the team, and they 
    neglect many obligatory duties, e.g., they neglect praying in congregation, 
    they delay their prayers beyond the proper time, and other things which are

What to say in sujud al-tilawah


Is sujud al-tilawah obligatory?","Praise be to Allah.Do you need wudu for sujud al-tilawah?
It is not essential to have wudu for sujud al-tilawah , according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions. 
How to do sujud al-tilawah
There is no salam or takbir when coming up from sujud al-tilawah, according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions. 
It is prescribed to say takbir when prostrating , because evidence to that effect is proven in the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). 
But if the sujud al-tilawah is done during prayer, then it is obligatory to say takbir when going down and when coming up, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do that in every movement of the prayer, and he said: “Pray as you have seen me praying.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari in his Sahih, 595)
What to say in sujud al-tilawah
The same dhikr and du`as are prescribed in sujud al-tilawah as in the prostration during prayer, because of the general meaning of the hadiths concerning that. Among these du`as are: 
Allahumma laka sajadtu wa bika amantu wa laka aslamtu, sajada wajhi lilladhi khalaqahu wa sawwarahu wa shaqqa sam’ahu wa basarahu bi hawlihi wa quwwatihi, tabarak Allahu ahsan al-khaliqin (O Allah, unto You I have prostrated and in You I have believed, and unto You I have submitted. My face has prostrated before Him Who created it and fashioned it, and brought forth its faculties of hearing and seeing by His Might and Power. Blessed is Allah, the Best of creators). 
This was narrated by Muslim in his Sahih, 1290 from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him); he said that he used to say this dhikr during the prostration of prayer, according to the hadith of ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him). 
We have mentioned above that it is prescribed to say the same in sujud al-tilawah as in the prostration in prayer. It was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to make du’a when he did sujud al-tilawah, and he would say:  
“Allahumma ‘ktub li biha ‘indaka ajran wa’mhu ‘anni biha wizran waj’alha li ‘indaka dukhran wa taqabbalha minni kama taqabbaltaha min ‘abdika Dawud (O Allah, record for me a reward for this (prostration), and remove from me a sin. Save it for me and accept it from me just as You accepted it from Your slave Dawud).” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 528)
What is obligatory is to say “Subhana Rabbiy al-A’la (Glory be to my Lord Most High), as is obligatory during the prostration of prayer. Any additional du’a or dhikr is mustahabb. 
Is sujud al-tilawah obligatory?
Sujud al-tilawah , whether during prayer or outside of it, is Sunnah, not obligatory, because evidence to that effect was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), in the hadith of Zayd ibn Thabit and in the hadith of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him).

22652,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22652,Our attitude towards differences among the scholars,"If there is some issue and there is more than one shar’i fatwa concerning it, and a fatwa that says it is halaal (permissible) and a fatwa that says it is haraam (forbidden), and a fatwa that is in between, then which should the Muslim choose, especially with regard to modern issues in which qiyaas (analogy) and ijtihaad (studying an issue within the framework of the Qur’aan and Sunnah) may play a part, and concerning which there is no shar’i text, such as bank interest, or what we call investments or returns on investment, or any other new names that are given to it? 
What do you say about people who say that this is the fatwa of a scholar, and that he is responsible for it, and that it is hung around his neck? 
What is your view on one who follows the dispensations granted by the scholars or the easier options that they grant? They say that these are the people of knowledge and these are their fatwas, and they know better than we do about that? But their fatwa may go against the fatwas of other shaykhs and scholars in the same country or in other countries, so which of them should we follow? How can we know what is right and what is not? Please note that most people do not have sufficient knowledge to decide whether the fatwa issued by a scholar or mufti differs from those issued by other scholars.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Before answering this important question, we must first describe the conditions that must be met by the mufti so that he may be regarded as one of the people of knowledge whose words count and if he expresses a different view we may then say that there is indeed a difference of opinion among the scholars.  There are many such conditions, which ultimately boil down to two: 
1 – Knowledge, because the mufti will be telling people about the rulings of Allaah, and he cannot speak of the rulings of Allaah if he is ignorant of them.  
2 – Soundness of character, i.e., he is righteous in all his affairs, he fears Allaah and he keeps away from anything that may undermine his credibility. The scholars are agreed that a fatwa cannot be accepted from one who is immoral, even if he is knowledgeable. This was clearly stated by al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadi. 
Whoever meets these two conditions is a scholar whose words may be accepted, but whoever does not meet these conditions is not one of the people of knowledge whose words may be accepted. The words of one who is known to be ignorant or who is known not to be of good character cannot be accepted. 
Al-Khilaaf bayna al-‘Ulama’ Asbaabuhu wa Mawqifuna minhu, by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, p. 23 
What is the Muslim’s attitude towards the differences of the scholars described above? 
If the Muslim has enough knowledge to enable him to compare the views of the scholars based on the evidence and to decide which is more likely to be correct, and he can tell what is more correct and more likely to be correct, then he must do that, because Allaah has commanded us to refer disputed matters to the Qur’aan and Sunnah, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“(And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allaah and His Messenger, if you believe in Allaah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination”[al-Nisa’ 4:59] 
So he should refer the disputed matter to the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and whatever appears to him to be more correct, based on the evidence, is what he should follow, because what is obligatory is to follow the evidence, and he may refer to the words of the scholars to help him understand the evidence. 
But if the Muslim does not have sufficient knowledge to enable him to decide which of the scholarly opinions is more likely to be correct, then he should ask the people of knowledge whose knowledge and religious commitment he trusts and then follow the advice or fatwas they give. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So ask the people of the Reminder if you do not know”
[al-Nahl 16:43]
The scholars have stated that the madhhab of the common man is the madhhab of his mufti. 
If their opinions differ, then he should follow the one who is most trustworthy and most knowledgeable. This is like when a person falls sick – may Allaah give us all good health – and he looks for the most trustworthy and knowledgeable doctor so that he can go to him, because he is most likely to give him the right treatment than anyone else. It is more important to be on the safe side in religious matters than in worldly ones. 
It is not permissible for the Muslim to follow whatever scholarly opinion suits his desires if it goes against the evidence, or to seek fatwas from those who he thinks are going to be lenient in their fatwas. 
Rather he has to be on the safe side when it comes to his religion, and ask the scholars who have the most knowledge and are most fearing of Allaah. 
Al-Khilaaf bayna al-‘Ulama’ by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 26; Liqa’ Munawwa’ ma’a Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan, p. 25, 26 
Is it befitting for a wise man to take precautions for his physical health and go to the most skilled doctors no matter how far away they are, and spend a great deal of money on that, then take the matter of his religion lightly and not to care about it unless it coincides with his whims and desires, and to take the easiest fatwa even if it is contrary to the truth? Indeed, there are even people who – Allaah forbid – ask a scholar a question, and if his fatwa does not suit their whims and desires, they will ask another, and another, until they find a person who will give them the fatwa they want! 
There is no scholar who does not have some issues in which he strove to make a decision on the basis of ijtihaad but failed to reach the right answer, but he is excused for that and he will have a reward for his ijtihaad, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If a judge passes a ruling to the best of his ability and knowledge and gets it right, he will have two rewards. If he passes a ruling to the best of his ability and knowledge but gets it wrong, he will have one reward.” (al-Bukhaari, 7352; Muslim, 1716). 
It is not permissible for the Muslim to follow the errors and mistakes of the scholars, for that combines all kinds of evil. Hence the scholars said: whoever follows that concerning which the scholars differed, and takes the easiest of their fatwas, becomes a heretic, or close enough. Ighaathat al-Lahfaan, 1/228. Heresy means hypocrisy. 
We ask Allaah to give us understanding and to help us to acquire beneficial knowledge and to do righteous deeds.

The Prophet’s ‘Umrahs","Praise be to Allah.‘Umrah in the months of hajj
It is permissible to do ‘Umrah during the months of Hajj , and there is no difference of opinion amongst the scholars concerning that. And it makes no difference whether you intend to do Hajj in the same year or not. 
The Prophet’s ‘Umrahs
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did ‘Umrah four times, all of which were in the month of Dhu’l-Qi’dah, which is one of the months of Hajj, which are Shawwal , Dhu’l-Qi’dah and Dhu’l-Hijjah . And he did not do Hajj except along with his last ‘Umrah, in the Farewell Pilgrimage. 
Al-Bukhaari (4148) and Muslim (1253) narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did ‘Umrah four times, all of them in Dhu’l-Qi’dah except for the one which he did with his Hajj. 
His ‘Umrah from al-Hudaybiyah or at the time of al-Hudaybiyah was in Dhu’l-Qi’dah, his ‘Umrah in the following year was in Dhu’l-Qi’dah, his ‘Umrah from Ji'irranah when he divided the spoils of Hunayn was in Dhu’l-Qi’dah, and his ‘Umrah which he did with his Hajj (was also in Dhu’l-Qi’dah).” 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary: 
“The conclusion we draw from the reports of Anas and Ibn ‘Umar is that they both indicate that (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) did four ‘Umrahs. The first was in Dhu’l-Qi’dah in the year of al-Hudaybiyah, 6 AH, when they were prevented from going further so they exited ihram, but this was counted as an ‘Umrah for them. The second was in Dhu’l-Qid’ah in 7 AH, which was to make up for the previous year. The third was in Dhu’l-Qi’dah of 8 AH, which was the year of the Conquest (of Makkah). And the fourth was with his Hajj, when he entered ihram for it in Dhu’l-Qi’dah but did the actions of ‘Umrah in Dhu’l-Hijjah.” 
And he said: 
“The scholars said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did ‘Umrah in Dhu’l-Qi’dah because of the virtue of this month and to go against the ideas of the Jahiliyyah, because they used to think that this was one of the worst of evil actions. 
So he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did it many times in these months to make it explicitly clear that this was permissible and to demonstrate clearly that the beliefs of the Jahiliyyah were false.”

    Rather talaaq (divorce) happens in one of two ways: either by

    It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (1/496): “A 
    woman should not allow anyone to photograph her face whether for a passport 
    or for any other purpose, because it (her face) is ‘awrah, and because the 
    existence of pictures in passports and elsewhere is one of the causes of 
    fitnah… unless that is the case of necessity.” 

    Based on that, it may be said that if the purpose of the 
    woman’s travel is da’wah, to call people to Allaah, then this is not 
    something necessary that would make this action permissible. In many foreign 
    countries women attend the mosques and Islamic centers and benefit from what 
    the daa’iyahs are doing there . So there is no need for this woman to expose 
    herself to fitnah or the risk of doing some haraam actions, especially since 
    there is such a great need for da’wah in the country where she is living. So 
    she should focus her da’wah efforts on the people around her, her sisters in 
    faith. Perhaps Allaah will cause others to benefit from her. 

    But if the reason is that the man is going out for the 
    purpose of da’wah, and his wife is to accompany him, then the ruling varies 
    according to the length of time that he will spend there. If he will be gone 
    for a long time, then it is acceptable for him to take his wife with him so 
    that he will be safe from temptation. But if it is only for a short time, 
    then he should not take his wife with him, and if he fears that he will fall 
    into temptation, then he should not go, rather he should occupy himself with 
    da’wah in the place where he is living in his own country.

     We ask Allaah to help us all to do that which He loves and 
    which pleases Him.

     And Allaah knows best.
