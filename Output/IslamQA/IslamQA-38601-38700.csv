38602,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38602,Broken Vows While Suffering From Waswas,"One affected by waswas (insinuating whispers) swore many oaths that he would not do an action again, then he broke the oaths. He has sworn many oaths and vows, and only Allah knows how many they are, and he is suffering from waswas. How can he expiate for what has passed?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
	Firstly:

	If a person swears many oaths 
	and breaks them, and does not offer expiation, one of two scenarios apply. 

	1 – The vows were all to do with 
	one thing, such as saying, “By Allah, I will not smoke,” then he breaks the 
	oath and does not offer expiation for that. Then he swears again that he 
	will not smoke, then he breaks the oath… in this case one expiation is 
	required. 

	2 – The oaths have to do with 
	several actions, such as saying, “By Allah, I will not drink; by Allah, I 
	will not wear (certain clothes); by Allah, I will not go to such and such a 
	place,” then he breaks all those oaths. Does he have to offer one expiation 
	or as many expiations as the oaths he swore and broke? There is a difference 
	of opinion among the fuqaha (jurists) concerning this matter. The majority 
	are of the view that he must offer several expiations, but the Hanbalis say 
	that he only has to offer one expiation. 

	The more correct view is that of 
	the majority, because these were oaths to do several things, and breaking 
	one of them does not mean that another is broken, they are not 
	interconnected. 

	Al-Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah 
	have mercy on him) was asked: I am a young man and I swore to Allah more 
	than three times that I would repent from a haram (unlawful) action. My 
	question is: do I have to offer one expiation or three? And what is my 
	expiation? 

	He replied: You have to offer 
	one expiation, which is feeding or clothing ten poor persons, or freeing a 
	slave. Whoever cannot do that must fast for three days, because Allah, may 
	He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning): 

Allah 
	will not impose blame upon you for what is meaningless in your oaths, but He 
	will impose blame upon you for [breaking] what you intended of oaths. So its 
	expiation is the feeding of ten needy people from the average of that which 
	you feed your [own] families or clothing them or the freeing of a slave. But 
	whoever cannot find [or afford it] - then a fast of three days [is 
	required]. That is the expiation for oaths when you have sworn. But guard 
	your oaths. (5:89) 

	This applies to every oath that 
	is made to do one thing or to refrain from one thing; if the oath is sworn 
	repeatedly, only one expiation is required, if he did not offer expiation 
	the first time. But if he offered expiation the first time, then he repeated 
	the oath, then he must offer another expiation if he breaks the oath. 
	Similarly, if he repeated it a third time and had offered expiation the 
	second time, he must offer a third expiation. 

	But if he swore oaths to do 
	several things or to refrain from several things, then he must offer 
	expiation for each one, such as if he said, “By Allah I will not speak to so 
	and so,” and “By Allah I will not eat food,” and “By Allah, I will not 
	travel to such and such a place,” and “By Allah, I will speak to so and so” 
	and “By Allah, I will hit him,” and so on. 

	What must be done is to give 
	each poor person half a sa’ (dry measure) of the local staple food, which is 
	approximately one and a half kilograms. With regard to clothing, it should 
	be what is sufficient for prayer, such as a thobe (robe) or a rida and izar 
	(upper and lower garment). If he gives them dinner or lunch (a meal), that 
	is sufficient, because of the general meaning of the ayah quoted above. And 
	Allah is the source of strength.  

	End quote from Majmoo’ Fatawa 
	al-Shaykh Ibn Baz (23/145) 

	Secondly: 

	If the person asked about is 
	suffering from waswas, and he swore these oaths under the influence of that 
	waswas, without intending to do so or wanting to swear an oath, then he does 
	not have to do anything. 

	Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah 
	have mercy on him) said: If a person is suffering from waswas, his divorce 
	does not count as such if he utters the words of divorce, if it was not done 
	intentionally, because this utterance of divorce was caused by the waswas 
	and was not intended, rather he was compelled to do it because of the 
	strength of the waswas and his lack of willpower to resist it. The Prophet 
	(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no divorce when 
	one is compelled.” So the divorce does not count as such if he did not truly 
	intend it willingly. This is something that he was compelled to do and did 
	not intend or choose to do, so it does not count as a divorce. End quote 
	from Fatawa Islamiyyah (3/277). 

	If this applies to divorce, then 
	it applies even more so to oaths, because the issue of marriage is more 
	serious than the issue of oaths.

I hope you can explain the Islamic view on these gifts?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    This is regarded as selling blood, and selling blood is 
    haraam according to scholarly consensus. 

    It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-‘Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth 
    al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Ifta’ (13/71): 

    It is not permissible to sell blood, because of the report in
    Saheeh al-Bukhaari from Abu Juhayfah who said that he bought a cupper 
    (as a slave) and ordered that his equipment be broken. He was asked about 
    that and he said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) forbade the price of blood. 

    Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath: What is meant is that it is 
    haraam to sell blood just as it is haraam to sell dead meat and pork, and it 
    is haraam according to scholarly consensus, i.e., to sell blood and take its 
    price. End quote.

    It is haraam and, the contract is invalid, to sell “blood 
    poured forth” because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  “… or 
    blood poured forth (by slaughtering or the like),” [al-An’aam 6:145].

Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Voluntary prayers done in congregation are of two types, one of which it is Sunnah to do in congregation, such as the eclipse prayer, prayers for rain, and Qiyam during Ramadan (Tarawih) . These are always done in congregation as is the Sunnah. 
The second type is not done in congregation, such as Qiyam Al-layl , the regular Sunnah prayers, Duha prayer , Tahiyyat Al-Masjid (greeting the mosque) and so on. But if they are done in congregation occasionally, that is permissible. 
As for doing them in congregation on an ongoing basis, that is not prescribed, rather it is a reprehensible innovation. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Companions and Followers were not accustomed to offering Nafl prayers in congregation. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) only rarely offered voluntary prayers in congregation. He used to pray qiyam Al-layl on his own, but when Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) stayed overnight with him, he prayed with him. 
On another occasion, Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) prayed with him, and on another occasion Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) prayed with him. Similarly he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also prayed at the house of `Utban ibn Malik Al-Ansari, in a place that he (`Utban) took as a prayer place for himself, so he prayed with him, and he also led Anas and his mother and the orphan in prayer, but in general his voluntary prayers were offered alone.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 23/414) 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on offering Nafl prayers in congregation, such as Duha prayer? 
He replied: 
“There is nothing wrong with offering Nafl prayers in congregation occasionally, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) led his companions in Nafl prayers on some nights. On one occasion ‘Abdullah ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) prayed with him, and on another occasion `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) prayed with him, and on one occasion Hudhayfah ibn Al-Yaman (may Allah be pleased with him) prayed with him. Hudhayfah narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited Al-Baqarah, An-Nisa’ and Al `Imran, and he did not reach a verse that spoke of seeking refuge with Allah but he sought refuge with Him, and he did not reach a verse that spoke of mercy but he asked for mercy. ‘Abdullah ibn Mas`ud prayed with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) one night, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood for a long time; `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud said: Until I thought of something bad. It was said: What is the bad thing that you thought of? He said: Sitting down and leaving him – that was because he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood for such a long time. `Abdullah ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) stood and prayed with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) one night, standing on his left, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took hold of his head and made him stand on his right. 
In conclusion, there is nothing wrong in offering some Nafl prayers in congregation, but this should not be a regular habit such that every regular Sunnah prayer is offered in congregation, because that is not prescribed.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, 14/334)

If a person is lying in his oath then it is makrooh in the sense of being haraam; the sin is greater and the punishment is more severe, because it is a false oath. Even if it is a means of selling the product, it erases the blessings of the sale and profit. This is indicated by the report narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “An oath may sell the product but erase the blessing.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim in their Saheehs, this version was narrated by al-Bukhaari.

Is there any differentiation between the one who does it and the one to whom it is done?,"Some Companions said that the punishment for homosexuality is to burn the homosexuals with fire, and some of them viewed that they should be thrown down from a high place then have stones thrown at them.

Punishment for homosexuality in Islam


Punishment for homosexuality in Islam: The Same for both partners?","Praise be to Allah.Homosexuality is a grave sin in Islam
The crime of homosexuality is one of the greatest of crimes, the worst of sins and the most abhorrent of deeds, and Allah punished those who did it in a way that He did not punish other nations. It is indicative of violation of the fitrah, total misguidance, weak intellect and lack of religious commitment, and it is a sign of doom and deprivation of the mercy of Allah. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And (remember) Lut (Lot), when he said to his people: ‘Do you commit the worst sin such as none preceding you has committed in the ‘Alamin (mankind and jinn)? ’Verily, you practice your lusts on men instead of women. Nay, but you are a people transgressing beyond bounds (by committing great sins).’ And the answer of his people was only that they said: ‘Drive them out of your town, these are indeed men who want to be pure (from sins)!’ Then We saved him and his family, except his wife; she was of those who remained behind (in the torment). And We rained down on them a rain (of stones). Then see what was the end of the Mujrimun (criminals, polytheists and sinners)”  [al-A’raf 7:80-84]
“Verily, by your life (O Muhammad), in their wild intoxication, they were wandering blindly. So As-Saihah (torment — awful cry) overtook them at the time of sunrise. And We turned (the towns of Sodom in Palestine) upside down and rained down on them stones of baked clay. Surely, in this are signs for those who see (or understand or learn the lessons from the Signs of Allah). And verily, they (the cities) were right on the highroad (from Makkah to Syria, i.e. the place where the Dead Sea is now).” [al-Hijr 15:72-76]
Al-Tirmidhi (1456), Abu Dawud (4462) and Ibn Majah (2561) narrated that Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever you find doing the action of the people of Lut, execute the one who does it and the one to whom it is done.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi) 
Ahmad (2915) narrated from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “May Allah curse the one who does the action of the people of Lut, may Allah curse the one who does the action of the people of Lut,” three times. This was classed as hasan by Shu’ayb al-Arnaut in Tahqiq al-Musnad. 
Punishment for homosexuality in Islam
The Companions unanimously agreed on the execution of homosexuals , but they differed as to how they were to be executed. Some of them were of the view that they should be burned with fire, which was the view of ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) and also of Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him), as we shall see below. And some of them thought that they should be thrown down from a high place then have stones thrown at them. This was the view of Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him). 
Some of them thought that they should be stoned to death, which was narrated from both ‘Ali and Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them). 
After the Companions, the jurists differed concerning the matter. Some of them said that the homosexual should be executed no matter what his situation, whether he is married or not. 
Some of them said that he should be punished in the same way as an adulterer, so he should be stoned if he is married and flogged if he is not married. 
Some of them said that a severe punishment should be carried out on him, as the judge sees fit. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah be pleased with him) discussed this issue at length, and he mentioned the evidence and arguments of the jurists, but he supported the first view. This is explained in his book al-Jawab al-Kafi li man sa-ala ‘an al-Dawa’ al-Shafi, which he wrote to deal with this immoral action. We will quote some of what he said: 
“Because the evil consequences of homosexuality are among the worst of evil consequences, so its punishment is one of the most severe of punishments in this world and in the Hereafter. 
The scholars differed as to whether it is to be punished more severely than zina, or whether the punishment for zina should be more severe, or whether the punishments should be the same. There are three points of view: 
Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib, Khalid ibn al-Walid, ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Zubayr, ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abbas, Malik, Ishaq ibn Rahawayh, Imam Ahmad according to the more sound of the two reports from him and al-Shafi’i according to one of his opinions, were of the view that the punishment for homosexuality should be more severe than the punishment for zina, and the punishment is execution in all cases, whether the person is married or not. 
Al-Shafi`i, according to the well-known view of his madhhab, and Imam Ahmad according to the other report narrated from him, were of the view that the punishment for the homosexual should be the same as the punishment for the adulterer.  
Imam Abu Hanifah was of the view that the punishment for the homosexual should be less severe than the punishment for the adulterer, and it is a punishment to be determined by the judge (ta’zir). 
Those who favoured the first view, who are the majority of the ummah – and more than one scholar narrated that there was consensus among the Companions on this point – said that there is no sin that brings worse consequences than homosexuality, and they are second only to the evil consequences of kufr, and they may be worse than the consequences of murder, as we shall see below in sha Allah. 
They said: Allah did not test anyone with this major sin before the people of Lut, and He punished them with a punishment that He did not send upon any other nation; He combined all kinds of punishment for them, such as destruction, turning their houses upside down, causing them to be swallowed up by the earth, sending stones down upon them from the sky, taking away their sight, punishing them and making their punishment ongoing, and wreaking vengeance upon them such as was not wrought upon any other nation. That was because of the greatness of the evil consequences of this crime which the earth can hardly bear if it is committed upon it, and the angels flee to the farthest reaches of heaven and earth if they witness it, lest the punishment be sent upon those who do it and they be stricken along with them. The earth cries out to its Lord, may He be blessed and exalted, and the mountains almost shift from their places. 
Killing the one to whom it is done is better for him than committing this act with him, because if a man commits sodomy with another man, in effect he kills him in such a way that there is no hope of life after that, unlike murder where the victim is wronged and is a martyr. They said: the evidence for that (i.e., that the evil consequences of homosexuality are worse than those of murder) is the fact that in the case of murder, Allah gives the next of kin the choice: if he wishes he may have him executed and if he wishes he may let him off, but He enjoined executing the homosexual as a hadd punishment, as the Companions of the Messenger of Allah were unanimously agreed, and as is clearly indicated by the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and there is no evidence to the contrary; rather this is what his Companions and the Rightly-Guided Caliphs (may Allah be pleased with them all) did. 
It is narrated from Khalid ibn al-Walid that he found a man among one of the Arab tribes with whom men would have intercourse as with a woman. He wrote to Abu Bakr al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) and Abu Bakr al-Siddiq consulted the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them). ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib had the strongest opinion of all of them, and he said: “No one did that but one of the nations, and you know what Allah did to them. I think that he should be burned with fire.” So Abu Bakr wrote to Khalid and he had him burned.  
‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abbas said: The highest point in the town should be found and the homosexual should be thrown head first from it, then stones should be thrown at him. 
Ibn 'Abbas derived this hadd punishment from the punishment that Allah sent upon the homosexuals of the people of Lut. 
Ibn 'Abbas is the one who narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) the words:  “Whoever you find doing the action of the people of Lut, execute the one who does it and the one to whom it is done.” This was narrated by the authors of al-Sunan and was classed as sahih by Ibn Hibban and others. Imam Ahmad quoted this hadith as evidence, and its isnad meets the conditions of al-Bukhari.   
They said: and it is narrated that he said: “May Allah curse the one who does the action of the people of Lut, may Allah curse the one who does the action of the people of Lut, may Allah curse the one who does the action of the people of Lut,” and it is not narrated that he cursed the adulterer three times in one hadith. He cursed those who do a variety of major sins, but he did not curse any of them more than once, but he repeated the curse for the homosexual three times. The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) agreed unanimously that the homosexual is to be executed, and none of them differed concerning that. Rather they differed as to the method of execution. Some people thought that this difference meant that they disagreed about executing him, so they narrated it as a matter concerning which the Companions differed, but it is a matter concerning which there was consensus among them, not a matter of difference.  
And they said: Whoever ponders the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a Fahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits: a great sin), and an evil way (that leads one to hell unless Allah Forgives him) .” [al-Isra 17:32] and what He says about homosexuality (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) Lut (Lot), when he said to his people: Do you commit the worst sin such as none preceding you has committed in the ‘Alamin (mankind and jinn)?.” [al-A’raf 7:80] will see the difference between them. When Allah mentioned zina, He described it as a “great sin” (fahishah – indefinite) among other great sins, but when He mentioned homosexuality, He called it “the worst sin” (al-fahishah – definite). This suggests that it contains all the essence of evil and sin.” (Al-Jawab al-Kafi (p. 260-263) 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“With regard to homosexuality, some of the scholars said that the punishment for it is the same as the punishment for zina, and it was said that it is less than that. But the correct view on which the Companions were unanimously agreed is that both are to be killed, the active and the passive partners, whether they are married or not. 
The authors of al-Sunan narrated from Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever you find doing the action of the people of Lut, execute the one who does it and the one to whom it is done.” And Abu Dawud narrated from Ibn 'Abbas concerning the unmarried person who commits a homosexual act that he said: He is to be stoned. And something similar was narrated from ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him). The Companions did not differ concerning the ruling that the homosexual is to be executed, but they differed concerning the methods. It was narrated from Abu Bakr al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) that he is to be burned, and from others that he is to be executed. 
It was narrated from some of them that a wall is to be knocked down on top of him until he dies beneath it.  
And it is said that both should be detained in the foulest of places until they die. 
It was narrated from some of them that he should be taken up to the highest place in the town and thrown down from it, to be followed with stones, as Allah did to the people of Lut. This was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas. According to the other report, he is to be stoned. This was the view of the majority of the salaf. They said: because Allah stoned the people of Lut, and stoning is prescribed for the zani by analogy with the stoning of the homosexual. Both are to be stoned, whether they are free or slaves, or one of them is the slave of the other, if they have reached the age of puberty. If one of them has not reached the age of puberty, he is to be punished but not stoned, and none is to be stoned except one who has reached puberty.”(Al-Siyasah al-Shar’iyyah, p. 138) 
Punishment for homosexuality in Islam: The Same for both partners?
The one to whom it is done is like the one who does it, because they both took part in the sin. So both are to be punished by execution, as it says in the hadith. But two exceptions may be made to that: 

One who is forced into sodomy by means of beating, death threats and the like. He is not subject to any punishment. 

It says in Sharh Muntaha al-Iradat (3/348): “There is no hadd punishment if the one who has been sodomized is forced into it, such as if the one who did it overpowered him or threatened him with death or beating and the like.”

If the one to whom it was done is a minor and has not reached the age of puberty. There is no hadd punishment in this case, but he should be disciplined and punished in a way that will deter him from committing this crime, as stated above in the quotation from Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah. 

Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in al-Mughni (9/62) that there is no difference of opinion among the scholars concerning the fact that the hadd punishment should not be carried out on one who is insane or a boy who has not yet reached the age of puberty.

38623,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38623,He had an erotic dream whilst fasting but he did not see any trace of semen,"I had an erotic dream whilst fasting, but when I woke up I did not see anything to indicate that I had ejaculated. I had a dream without ejaculating. Should I do ghusl and complete my fast, or should I complete the fast without doing ghusl, or should I break my fast?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
If a person has an erotic dream then when he wakes up he does not see any trace of semen on his clothes, then he does not have to do ghusl. 
Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni: 
If a person thinks that he had an erotic dream, but he did not see any semen, then he does not have to go ghusl. Ibn al-Mundhir said: Every scholar from whom I acquired knowledge is agreed on this. 
Umm Salamah narrated that Umm Sulaym said: “O Messenger of Allaah, does a woman have to do ghusl if she has an erotic dream?” He said: “Yes, if she sees water.” Agreed upon. This indicates that she does not have to do ghusl if she does not see water (discharge). 
Secondly: 
Fasting is not invalidated if one sees an erotic dream because this is something that the fasting person does not choose to do, it happens involuntarily. 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’: 
If a person sees an erotic dream, that does not invalidate his fast, according to scholarly consensus, because it is involuntary, as in the case where a fly enters his mouth and he swallows it involuntarily. This is what is to be followed in this issue. With regard to the hadeeth narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) which says “The one who vomits, has an erotic dream or has cupping done does not break his fast” – this is a weak (da’eef) hadeeth which should not be taken as evidence. 
It says in al-Mughni (4/363): 
If a person has an erotic dream, that does not invalidate his fast, because that does not happen by his choice. This is akin to if something enters his throat whilst he is sleeping. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked in Majmoo’ al-Fatawa (15/276) about a person who slept during the day in Ramadan and semen came out of him – does he have to make up this day? 
He replied: 
He does not have to make it up, because a wet dream does not happen by his choice, it is involuntary. But he does have to do ghusl if he sees semen. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked in Fatawa al-Siyaam (p. 284) about a person who has an erotic dream during the day in Ramadan. He replied: His fast is still valid, and if he has an erotic dream that does not invalidate his fast, because it was involuntary. The Pen was lifted from him whilst he was asleep [i.e., his actions are not recorded and he will not be brought to account for them]. 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (10/274): 
If a person has an erotic dream whilst he is fasting or in ihraam for Hajj or ‘Umrah, there is no sin on him and he does not have to offer expiation, and that does not invalidate his fast or Hajj or ‘umrah. He has to do ghusl from janaabah if any semen came out.",Islam Q&A
38624,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38624,Does Bleeding Following Menstruation Invalidate the Fast?,"What is the ruling on bleeding from the vagina during the fast, when the monthly period ended ten days previously and the woman was suffering an infection in the womb? This blood is not like ordinary menstrual blood, rather it is like a short, thin thread and it happened once for a day and then stopped.","Any bleeding that resumes after the period is over is not menstrual blood. So you can pray, fast, do tawaf or any other acts of worship.",,"Praise be to Allah.This bleeding is not menstruation , so it does not affect the fast, so do not stop praying because of it. But you have to do wudu for each prayer. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin was asked: if a small spot of blood comes out of a woman during the day in Ramadan, and this (spotting) continues throughout the month of Ramadan and she fasts, is her fast valid? 
He replied: 
“Yes, her fast is valid, and this spotting does not matter because it is from a vein. It was narrated that ‘Ali ibn Abi aalib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “These spots that are like a nosebleed are not menstruation.” (Sittun Su-alan ‘an Ahkam al-Hayd)
The Standing Committee was asked: Sometimes my period lasts nine days and sometimes ten. When I become pure (i.e., my period ends) and I get up to do housework, it comes back, starting and stopping. If it comes back after the time stated in shari’ah that a period may last, is it permissible for me to fast, pray and do ‘umrah? 
They replied: 
“The length of the period in your case is the length of time your period usually lasts, which is ten or nine days. When the bleeding stops after nine or ten days, then do ghusl and fast and pray, and do tawaf for Hajj or `umrah, or a voluntary fast, and it is permissible for your husband to have intercourse with you. Any bleeding that resumes after the period is over because of activities that you do or any other reason is not menstrual blood, rather it is due to some sickness or problem, so it does not mean that you cannot pray, fast, do tawaf or any other acts of worship. Rather you should wash it away, like any other impurity, then do wudu for every prayer, and pray and do tawaf around the Ka`bah, and read Quran.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 5/426)

38634,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38634,"When should the one who is praying behind the imam bow? When the imam says takbeer, or straight after the takbeer, or when?","When we are praying behind the imam, when should we start to bow? Should we bow when we hear the imam say Allahu akbar or during that or after he has finished saying it?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.What is prescribed for the one who is praying behind the imam is to follow his imam, not to do anything before him or at the same time as him, or to delay doing it. Rather he should do things straight after his imam does them. 
This is indicated by the report narrated by al-Bukhari (378) and Muslim (417), from the hadeeth of Anas ibn Maalik and Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with them), according to which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The imam is only appointed to be followed, so when he says takbeer, then say takbeer; when he bows, then bow (and do not bow until he bows); when he says Sami’a Allahu liman hamidah, then say Allahumma rabbana laka’l-hamd. If he prays standing, then pray standing.” The phrase in brackets was added in the version narrated by Abu Dawood (603). 
The words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “when he bows, then bow and do not bow until he bows”, and the same with regard to prostration, indicate that the person who is praying behind the imam should not start to move to the next part of the prayer until after the imam has done it. So he should not bow until the imam bows, and he should not prostrate until the imam prostrates. This is stated clearly in the hadeeth of al-Bara’ ibn ‘Aazib (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: When the Messenger of Allah (S) said “Sami’a Allahu liman hamidah,” no one of us would bend his back until the Messenger of Allah (S) had gone down in prostration, then we would go down in prostration after him. Narrated by al-Bukhari (811)and Muslim (474). 
Al-Nawawi said in Sharh Muslim: This hadeeth shows that this is one of the etiquettes of prayer and it is Sunnah for the one who is praying behind the imam not to start going down (for prostration) until the imam has placed his forehead on the ground. End quote. 
Based on this, what is prescribed for the one who is praying behind the imam is to follow his imam straight after he has moved to the next part of the prayer. So what counts is the action of the imam, not his takbeer. This applies to those who can see the imam. As for the members of the congregation who cannot see him, then they should follow his words, and they should start to move to the next part of the prayer after the imam finishes saying the takbeer.

We would like an answer to this question with evidence. Please do not forget the many taxes that a businessman pays every year.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for the one who buys a product for trading or to keep, to sell it for more than he bought it for, for cash or on credit. We do not know of any limit on profit, but one should be easygoing, because there are reports which encourage that. But if the product is known locally to be of a certain price, a Muslim should not sell it for more to one who is unaware of that, without telling him of this fact, because selling it for more is a kind of deceit. The Muslim is the brother of his fellow-Muslim and he should not wrong him, abandon him, cheat him or betray him, rather he should advise him sincerely wherever he is. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Religion is sincerity.” Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh. And in al-Saheehayn it is narrated that Jareer ibn ‘Abd-Allah al-Yamaani said: “I swore allegiance to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), pledging to establish prayer, pay zakaah and be sincere towards every Muslim.” End quote.

It also says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah: 
Profits in business are not limited, rather they depend on supply and demand, plenty and scarcity. But it is good for the Muslim, whether he is a trader or otherwise, to be easygoing in buying and selling, and not to take advantage of his companion’s negligence in order to deceive him when buying or selling. Rather he should pay attention to the rights of Islamic brotherhood. End quote.
