I am also in a foreign country. Is it permissible for me to phone her father so that he can say, “I offer you my daughter So and so in marriage,” and I can say, “I accept,” with the consent of the girl and in the presence of two Muslim witnesses who are listening to what he and I say by means of speakers attached to the phone? Would this be considered as a valid marriage contract according to sharee’ah?",,,"Praise be to Allah.I put this question to our Shaykh al-Mufti al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allah ibn Baz, who replied that if what is described is genuine (and there is no cheating involved), then it achieves the purpose of meeting the shar'i conditions of nikaah and the marriage contract is valid.

2202,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2202,The Prophet’s dream about marrying ‘Aa’ishah,"In reply to a question regarding marriage
      of prophet Mohammad (
), I was given to understand that prophet Mohammad had a dream in
      which he saw that he got married with hazrat Aisah who was only 6-7 year old at that time.
      Consequently, he discussed this with hazrat Aisha. In other word this marriage was
      arranged by Allah himself. If so, we have a logical answer to satisfy critics that it was
      ordered by Allah. However, in support of that there must be an athentic hadith or a verse
      in the Qur'an.I will appreciate if you can provide me info regarding this issue.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The hadeeth to which you refer was reported by Imaam al-Bukhaari (may
    Allaah have mercy on him) in his Saheeh from Aaishah (may Allaah be
    pleased with her), who said that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    said to her: You were shown to me twice in a dream. I saw you in a piece of silk
    (i.e., he saw her image on a piece of silk, or he saw her wearing a silken garment). I was
    told, This is your wife, so unveil her, and it was you. I said: if this dream
    is from Allaah then it will come to pass. (Saheeh al-Bukhaari,
    3606).
    In his commentary on this hadeeth, Ibn Hajar (may Allaah
    have mercy on him) said: This dream came after his mission had started, and it was a
    wahy (revelation) that had implications in real life. (Its implication was that he did
    indeed marry her later on). His words and it was you indicate that he had seen
    her before and knew what she looked like. (See Fath al-Baari)
There is nothing in the hadeeth to indicate that his marriage to
    Aaishah was as a result of that dream. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) asked her father for her hand in marriage, and her father Abu Bakr
    gave her in marriage, in the usual fashion, as is indicated in the following hadeeth:
 Urwah reported that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) asked Abu Bakr for Aaishahs hand in marriage, and
    Abu Bakr said to him: But I am your brother. He said: You are my brother
    according to the religion and Book of Allaah (i.e., my brother in Islam), and she is
    permissible for me (to marry). (Bukhaari, 4691).
In his commentary Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:
    Ibn Abi Aasim reported via Yahyaa ibn Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Haatib from
    Aaishah that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent
    Khawlah bint Hakeem to Abu Bakr to ask for Aaishahs hand in marriage.
    Abu Bakr asked her, Is she right for him? Because she is the daughter of my
    brother. Khawlah went back and mentioned this to the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings
    of Allaah be upon him). He told her: Go back and tell him: You are my brother
    in Islam, and your daughter is right for me. She went back to Abu Bakr and
    told him, and he said: Call the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah
    be upon him). So he came and the marriage was performed.
The phrase You are my brother according to the religion and Book
    of Allaah (i.e., my brother in Islam) was referring to the aayah (interpretation of
    the meaning): The believers are nothing else than brothers (in Islamic
    religion) [al-Hujuraat 49:10] and other similar aayaat. The phrase
    she is permissible for me (to marry) means it is permissible to marry her even
    though she is the brothers daughter, because the kind of brotherhood that would
    prevent such a marriage is the brotherhood of descent (same parent) or of radaaah
    (by being breastfed in infancy by the same woman), not the brotherhood of faith.
As regards the woman to whom the Prophets marriage was arranged
    in heaven, as it were, by Allaah, and not in the customary fashion, this was Zaynab bint
    Jahsh (may Allaah be pleased with her), as is indicated by the hadeeth of Anas (may Allaah
    be pleased with him), who said: Zaynab used to boast (to her co-wives) about how she
    had got married to the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), saying:
    Your families arranged your marriages but Allaah arranged my marriage from above the
    seven heavens. (al-Bukhaari, 6870). No other wife except Zaynab was married to
    the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in such a unique fashion;
    Aaishahs marriage was arranged as described in the reports quoted above.

2209,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2209,Is saying “Sadaqa Allaahu al-‘Azeem ”    after reciting from Qur’an bid’ah?,"Is saying Sadaqaallahu Al Azim after reciting or quoting from the Qur'an an innovation, and if it is, how was it introduced?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Many people have the habit of ending a recitation from the Quraan with the words Sadaqa Allaahu al-Azeem (Almighty Allaah has spoken the truth), but this has no basis in Islam because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not do it, nor was it the custom of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them), and it was unknown among the Taabieen (the generation after the Sahaabah). This custom arose in later times because some reciters would say these words, on the basis of the aayah: Say: Allaah has spoken the truth [Aal Imraan 3:95 interpretation of the meaning], and people liked this. But this istihsaan (being liked) should be rejected, because if this was really something good, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), the Sahaabah and the Taabieen the salaf or first and best generations of the ummah would not have neglected to do it.
The aayah Say: Allaah has spoken the truth (Aal Imraan 3:95 interpretation of the meaning) does not mean that these words should be said at the end of any reading or recitation. If that were the case, He would have said, When you finish reading, say Allaah has spoken the truth, just as He said (interpretation of the meaning): So when you want to recite the Quraan, seek refuge with Allaah from Shaytaan (Satan), the outcast (the cursed one). [al-Nahl 16:98]
The aayah which the innovators use to support their practice of saying Sadaqa Allaah after reciting Quraan was actually revealed in the context of confirming what was said about how all food had been lawful to Bani Israeel except what Israeel had made unlawful for himself. Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): Say (O Muhammad): Bring here the Tawraat (Torah) and recite it, if you are truthful. Then, after that, whosoever shall invent a lie against Allaah, such shall indeed be the zaalimoon (disbelievers). Say (O Muhammad), Allaah has spoken the truth; follow the religion of Ibraaheem (Islamic monotheism, i.e., he used to worship Allaah alone), and he was not of al-mushrikeen (polytheists). [Aal Imraan 3:93-95]
If this aayah meant that these words should be said after reciting from the Quraan, the first one to know and do this would have been the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Because this is not the case, we know that this is not what was meant.
In conclusion, therefore, saying Sadaqa Allaahu al-Azeem after reciting Quraan is an innovation, and the Muslim should not say it.
But believing that Allaah has spoken the truth is obligatory, and whoever disbelieves or doubts the truth of what Allaah has said is a kaafir who is outside of the pale of Islam. We seek refuge with Allaah from that.
If a person says Allaah has spoken the truth on certain occasions, such as when something He has foretold comes to pass, affirming the truth of what He has said, then this is permissible, because something similar has been reported in the Sunnah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was giving a speech, and al-Hasan and al-Husayn came along, so he came down from the minbar, picked them up and put them in from of him, then he said: Indeed Allaah has spoken the truth: Your wealth and your children are only a trial [al-Taghaabun 64:15 interpretation of the meaning].","(Izaalat al-sitaar ‘an al-jawaab al-mukhtaar by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 79-80)"

    not be able to avoid it, or you believe it is more likely that you will be too weak to
    avoid it, then you should change to another specialty from now, so that you will be able
    to practice a profession that will be acceptable to Allaah. Alternatively, if you see that
    there are impediments to practicing your specialty due to the involvement of forbidden
    items, you could take the initiative and commitment to finding permissible alternatives,
    whether natural or synthetic, to the forbidden items. The important thing is to ensure you
    will not put yourself in a position where you are involved in the sale, receiving, or
    giving of items that are haraam. 
Some of the issues having to do with medicine need to be
    contemplated; for example, if a medicine contains alcohol and would intoxicate a person if
    a large amount was drunk (i.e. of the medicine itself), then it is haraam; otherwise it is
    not haraam. Similarly there are questions surrounding the impurities that form the
    ingredients of some medicines: is the structure of the impure substance changed in
    totality when it is mixed with the other ingredients, or does it remain the same? Surely
    you are not unaware that there are medicines taken from the urine of pregnant women, or
    blood, or from body parts removed from humans, such as placentas, to which the rulings
    concerning dead meat apply. The rulings governing all of these things need to be
    investigated, and consequently the rulings regarding their sale; the matter needs to be
    studied both from the point of view of Islamic Sharee'ah and of chemical analysis.

1.	Make wudu (ablution)
2.	Offer two rak’ahs of sunnah prayer
3.	Make the du’a mentioned in the detailed answer below.","How to pray Istikharah


Commentary on the hadith of istikharah","Praise be to Allah.How to pray Istikharah
The description of Salat al-Istikharah (istikharah prayer) was reported by Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah al-Salami (may Allah be pleased with him) who said:
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to teach his Companions to make istikharah in all things, just as he used to teach them surahs from the Quran. He said: If any one of you is concerned about a decision he has to make, then let him pray two rak’ahs of non-obligatory prayer, then say: Allahumma inni astakheeruka bi ‘ilmika wa astaqdiruka bi qudratika wa asaluka min fadlika, fa innaka taqdiru wa la aqdir, wa ta’lamu wa la a’lam, wa anta ‘allam al-ghuyoob. Allahumma fa in kunta ta'lamu hadhal-amra (then the matter should be mentioned by name) khayran li fi ‘ajil amri wa ajilihi (or: fi deeni wa ma’ashi wa ‘aqibati amri) faqdurhu li wa yassirhu li thumma barik li fihi. Allahumma wa in kunta ta'lamu annahu sharrun li fi deeni wa ma’ashi wa ‘aqibati amri (or: fi ‘ajili amri wa ajilihi) fasrifni ‘anhu [wasrifhu ‘anni] waqdur li al-khayr haythu kana thumma raddini bihi (O Allah, I seek Your guidance [in making a choice] by virtue of Your knowledge, and I seek ability by virtue of Your power, and I ask You of Your great bounty. You have power, I have none. And You know, I know not. You are the Knower of hidden things. O Allah, if in Your knowledge, this matter (then it should be mentioned by name) is good for me both in this world and in the Hereafter (or: in my religion, my livelihood and my affairs ), then ordain it for me, make it easy for me, and bless it for me. And if in Your knowledge it is bad for me and for my religion, my livelihood and my affairs (or: for me both in this world and the next), then turn me away from it, [and turn it away from me], and ordain for me the good wherever it may be and make me pleased with it.
(Reported by al-Bukhari, 6841; similar reports are also recorded by al-Tirmidhi, al-Nasai, Abu Dawood, Ibn Majah and Ahmad)
Commentary on the hadith of istikharah
Ibn Hajr (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on this hadith:
“Istikharah is a word which means asking Allah to help one make a choice, meaning choosing the best of two things where one needs to choose one of them.
Concerning the phrase The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to teach us to make istikharah in all things, Ibn Abi Jamrah said: It is a general phrase which refers to something specific. With regard to matters that are wajib (obligatory) or mustahabb (liked or encouraged), there is no need for istikharah to decide whether to do them, and with regard to matters that are haram (forbidden) or makrooh (disliked), there is no need for istikharah to decide whether to avoid them. The issue of istikharah is confined to matters that are mubah (allowed), or in mustahabb matters when there is a decision to be made as to which one should be given priority. I say: it refers to both great and small matters, and probably an insignificant issue could form the groundwork for a big issue.
The phrase If any one of you is concerned appears in the version narrated by Ibn Mas’ud as: if any one of you wants to do something
Let him pray two rak’ahs of non-obligatory prayer. This is mentioned to make it clear that it does not mean Fajr prayer, for example. Al-Nawawi said in al-Adhkar: He can pray istikarah after two rak’ahs of regular sunnah prayer done at zhuhr for example, or after two rak’ahs of any nafl prayers whether they are regularly performed or not It seems to be the case that if he made the intention to pray istikharah at the same time as intending to pray that particular prayer, this is fine, but not if he did not have this intention.
Ibn Abi Jamrah said: The wisdom behind putting the salat before the du’a is that istikharah is intended to combine the goodness of this world with the goodness of the next. A person needs to knock at the door of the King (Allah), and there is nothing more effective for this than prayer, because it contains glorification and praise of Allah, and expresses one's need for Him at all times.
The phrase then let him say would seem to imply that the du’a should be said after finishing the prayer, and the word thumma (then) probably means after reciting all the words of the salat and before saying salam.
The phrase O Allah, I seek Your guidance by virtue of Your knowledge is explaining because You know best. Similarly, by virtue of Your power most likely means seeking Your help. I seek ability (astaqdiruka) means I ask You to give me the power or ability (qudrah) to do whatever is being asked for, or it probably means I ask You to decree (tuqaddir) this for me. So it may mean making it easy.
I ask You of Your great bounty refers to the fact that Allah gives out of His great generosity, but no one has the right to His blessings. This is the opinion of Ahl al-Sunnah.
You have power, I have none. And You know, I know not refers to the fact that power and knowledge belong to Allah alone, and the slave has no share of them except what Allah decrees for him.
O Allah, if in Your knowledge this matter, according to one report, he should mention it by name. It is apparent from the context that he should state it, but it is probably sufficient to be thinking of the matter whilst making this du’a.
Then ordain it for me means make it happen for me or it may mean make it easy for me.
Then turn it away from me, and turn me away from it means so that my heart will no longer feel attached to it after it has been turned away.
Make me pleased with it means make me content with it, so that I will never regret asking for it or be sorry that it happened, because I do not know how it will turn out, even if at the time of asking I am pleased with it.
The secret is that one’s heart should not be attached to the matter in question, because that will result in a person becoming restless. Being pleased with something means that one’s heart is content with the decree of Allah.” (Summarized from the commentary of al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) on the hadeeth in Saheeh al-Bukhari, Kitab al-Da’wat and Kitab al-Tawheed.)

      problem with his wife. Neither she, nor he want divorce as they have 3 children, yet he
      cannot live with her and has left the country. He would like to remarry in the new country
      of residence, but is afraid of the condition of equity of time between the two wives and
      that he will be called to account for it before Allah. His wife will not willingly
      relinquish her rights as she wants him to return to her, nor will she accept a second
      marriage... Is it halal for him to tell her that he will retain her as a wife only under
      the condition that she relinquish her rights to his time to a second wife? He does not
      want to oppress himself nor does he want to oppress her.. what are his options?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If he has no interest in his present wife, there is nothing wrong with
    divorcing her and marrying another, but if he and she come to an agreement whereby she may
    remain his wife for the sake of the children, there is nothing wrong with this either. If
    he gives her the choice between divorce and giving up her rights to his time and his
    spending on her, in whole or in part, this is not oppression. Oppression is when he keeps
    her by force without giving her any of her rights whilst at the same time refusing to give
    her a divorce.
The evidence (daleel) that the situation described above is
    permissible is to be found in the hadeeth narrated by Imaam al-Bukhaari from
    ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), which comments on the aayah
    (interpretation of the meaning): “And if a woman fears cruelty or desertion on her
    husband’s part…” [al-Nisaa’ 4:128]. She said: “This
    was a woman who was married to a man who did not care for her, so he wanted to divorce her
    and marry someone else. (According to another report narrated by al-Bukhaari she said: He
    was a man who saw something he disliked in his wife, so he wanted to divorce her.) She
    said to him: ‘Keep me, do not divorce me. Marry someone else and I will absolve you
    of your obligation to spend on me and share your time with me.’ This is what Allaah
    referred to when He revealed the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘…
    there is no sin on them both if they make terms of peace between themselves; and making
    peace is better…’ [al-Nisaa’ 4:128].” (Reported by
    al-Bukhaari, 4807)
    “This was a woman who was married to a man who did not
    care for her” means that he did not love her or want to treat her well or stay with
    her. “I will absolve you of your obligation towards me” means: leave me without
    divorcing me. Concerning this issue, Allaah revealed the words (interpretation of the
    meaning): “And if a woman fears cruelty or desertion on her husband’s
    part…” [al-Nisaa’ 4:128]. ‘Ali reported that this was
    revealed concerning a woman who is married to a man and does not want to leave him, so
    they come to an agreement that he will visit her every three or four days.” 
Al-Tirmidhi reported via Sammaak from ‘Ikrimah from Ibn ‘Abbaas
    that he said: “Sawdah was afraid that the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) would divorce her, so she said: ‘O Messenger of
    Allaah, do not divorce me; give my day to ‘Aa’ishah.’ So he did so. Then
    this aayah was revealed.” Al-Tirmidhi said: “(This is) hasan ghareeb.”
    I say: there is corroborating evidence in a hadeeth from ‘Aa’ishah narrated by
    al-Bukhaari and Muslim, without referring to the revelation of the aayah. (From Fath
    al-Baari).
The hadeeth mentioned by al-Haafiz ibn Hijr (may Allaah have mercy on him)
    is in Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 2966, where it is reported that Ibn ‘Abbaas said:
    “Sawdah was afraid that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    would divorce her, so she said: ‘Do not divorce me. Keep me and give my day to
    ‘Aa’ishah.’ So he did so, then Allaah revealed the aayah: ‘…
    there is no sin on them both if they make terms of peace between themselves; and making
    peace is better…’ [al-Nisaa’ 4:128]. So whatever they agreed upon was
    permissible.” It is as if the last sentence was the comment of Ibn ‘Abbaas. Abu
    ‘Iesa said: this is a hasan ghareeb hadeeth.
Al-Mubaarakpoori said, commenting on this hadeeth:
‘Sawdah was afraid…’ This refers to Sawdah bint Zam’ah
    ibn Qays al-Qurashiyyah al-‘Aamiriyyah. The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) married her in Makkah after Khadeejah had died, and
    consummated the marriage there. The scholars agree that he consummated his marriage to her
    before he consummated his marriage to ‘Aa’ishah, and she migrated to Madeenah
    with him. She died at the end of the khilaafah of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab.
‘…was afraid that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) would divorce her, so she said…’ Al-Bukhaari and Muslim
    reported from ‘Aa’ishah that Sawdah bint Zam’ah gave her day to
    ‘Aa’ishah, so the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used
    to give ‘Aa’ishah her own day and that of Sawdah. Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath:
    Abu Dawood reported this hadeeth (from ‘Aa’ishah): ‘The Messenger of Allaah
    
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) never used to prefer any of us over
    others in sharing his time (i.e., he was fair in dividing his nights among his wives, and
    each one of them had her allotted night). When Sawdah bint Zam’ah grew old and feared
    that the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) might
    divorce her, she said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, my day is for
    ‘Aa’ishah,’ and he accepted this from her. Then concerning this and similar
    cases, the aayah was revealed (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And if a woman fears
    cruelty or desertion on her husband’s part…’ [al-Nisaa’ 4:128]. These
    reports agree that she feared divorce and so gave her day to ‘Aa’ishah.
Then al-‘Allaamah al-Mubaraakpoori said: The aayah may be explained
    thus: ‘If a woman fears’ means if she expects. ‘Cruelty’ means
    that he spurns her by refusing to sleep with her or by spending less on her than he
    should, because he dislikes her and wants to marry someone more beautiful. ‘Desertion’
    means that he turns his face away from her. ‘There is no sin on them both if they
    make terms of peace between themselves’ means with regard to the sharing of his
    time and his spending on her, i.e., he should still give her something in this regard
    (sharing time or spending) in order to preserve the relationship: if she accepts, this is
    OK, otherwise the husband must either give her her full rights or divorce her. ‘Making
    peace is better’ means better than separation, cruelty and desertion. Whatever
    they agree upon between themselves is permissible.

  be answered: the duaa of one who is oppressed, the duaa 
  of a traveller, and the duaa of a parent for his child? 
  (Reported by Ibn Maajah, 3852; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, 
  no. 3033). The word parent [waalid, lit. father] includes both 
  father and mother. You are his mother, who bore him, nursed him, fed him and 
  brought him up. You are more compassionate towards him than all his other relatives, 
  and you are the one who has suffered the most grief and distress because of 
  his loss. Pray for him for forgiveness, mercy, Paradise and salvation from the 
  Fire. Pray for him in your salaat and your sujood (prostration), in the last 
  third of the night and on Fridays before sunset, and at all other times and 
  in all other circumstances. 
Be of good cheer and remember the great reward which will be 
  yours if you bear this loss with patience, accept the will and decree of Allaah, 
  and hope for reward. You have lost your child to One Who is more compassionate 
  towards him than you, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate, Allaah, the 
  Lord of the Worlds. You also have the consolation of knowing that if you and 
  he die believing in Tawheed and in Islam, you will be reunited after death. 
  The righteous will be reunited with their offspring in Paradise, even if they 
  are of a lesser status than them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
  And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in Faith, - 
  to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward 
  of their deeds in anything. Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned.

As regards your question about what you can do for your father 
  and your son who have passed away, you will find a detailed and comprehensive 
  answer under # 763, which describes things which 
  the living can do for the benefit of the dead.
Finally, we console you with the words with which the Prophet 
   (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) consoled 
  a mother whose son had died:
To Allaah belongs whatever He takes and whatever He gives. Everything 
  has an appointed time with Him. Have patience and hope of a reward from Him.

When i was a child Iwas told that two rakat of Zuhr prayer on friday is only for men and women are supposed to pray on friday as any other day . Please guide me .,,,"Praise be to Allah.Women do not have to pray Salaat al-Jumu’ah (Friday prayer). Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “As regards women, there is no difference (among the scholars) concerning the fact that Jumu’ah is not obligatory for them.”
(Al-Mughni ma’a al-Sharh al-Kabeer, 2/151). But if a woman prays Jumu’ah in the mosque, then she should pray two rak’ahs, just like the men. Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Jumu’ah is not obligatory for one who is weak because of sickness or who has another valid excuse, or for women, but if any of these people attend Jumu’ah, they should pray two rak’ahs.” (al-Muhallaa, 5/81).

2237,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2237,Reading Soorat Yaa-Seen in congregation on Friday nights,Is it forbidden in Islam to read the Sura Yaseen on Friday nights in a congregational manner in the mosque?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Reading the Quran brings a great reward. Allah will multiply the reward for every letter of every aayah in any soorah that is read, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever reads one letter of the Book of Allah will have one hasanah (reward) for doing so, and every hasanah will be multiplied by 10. I do not say that ‘Alif, laam, meem’ is one letter, but ‘Alif’ is a letter, ‘laam’ is a letter and ‘meem’ is a letter.’”
(Reported and classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi, 2835).
He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also said: “Read the Quran, for it will come on the Day of Resurrection interceding for its companions (i.e., those who read it)…”
(Reported by Muslim, 1337)
This reward will only be for the one who reads it sincerely, following the Sunnah. But the one who innovates in his readings (whether it be in the way he reads, the position he adopts when reading, the number of times he reads or the times when he reads) will not earn the reward, rather his deeds will be rejected and thrown back at him, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever innovates something in this matter of ours (i.e., Islam) will have it rejected.” (Reported by Muslim, 3242). According to another report, he said: “Whoever does something that is not a part of this matter of ours, will have it rejected.” (Reported by Muslim, 3243)
Because a specific time – Friday night – is being allocated and the reading is being done in congregation although no saheeh evidence to that effect has been reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), this action is bid’ah and is not prescribed or allowed by sharee’ah. It should therefore be avoided. We ask Allah to guide us all to the truth and help us to follow the Sunnah. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Imam Ibn Jarir At-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Jami` Al-Bayan `an Ta’wil Ayi Al-Quran (16/423): 
“[In the phrase] those who acted righteously from among their fathers, and their wives, and their offspring, Allah, may He be Glorified, is saying that they will be admitted to Paradise those who He describes as those who (interpretations of the meanings) fulfil the Covenant of Allah, those who join that which Allah has commanded to be joined [i.e., upholding the ties of kinship] and fear their Lord, and who remain patient, seeking their Lord’s Countenance, [and] perform As-Salah – those who do the deeds mentioned in the three preceding ayat. Those who acted righteously from among their fathers, and their wives, and their offspring refers to their wives, their families and their offspring, and their `righteousness’ is their faith in Allah and their obedience to His commands and the commands of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).”
They will be with their spouses, reclining in the shade of Paradise, filled with the deepest joy. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“They and their wives will be in pleasant shade, reclining on thrones.” [Ya-Sin 36:56]
“Enter Paradise, you and your wives, in happiness.” [Az-Zukhruf 43:70]
Among the bountiful and abundant blessings that Allah bestows upon His creation is that if the believers’ offspring follow them in faith, they will be joined with their fathers in the same level of Paradise even if they themselves did not reach that level, so that their fathers may have the joy of seeing their offspring.
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

Virtues of Surat al-Ikhlas


Virtues of “La ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu min al-zalimin”","Praise be to Allah.Names of some surahs
Firstly, the better-known names and numbers of the surahs about which you ask are as follows:

Surah al-Hamdu is Surat al-Fatihah (the Opening), Surah #1
Surah Inna Fatahna is Surat al-Fath (the Victory), Surah #48
Allahus-Samad is Surat al-Ikhlas (the Purity), Surah #112
'Amma yatasa alun is Surat al-Naba (the Great News), Surah #78

The verse “La ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu min al-zalimin (None has the right to be worshipped except You [O Allah]. Glorified (and Exalted) are You. Truly, I have been of the wrong-doers) is from Surat al-Anbiya, Surah 21, Verse 87.
Commentary on the Book Dalail al-Khayrat
A word of warning: The book Dalail al-Khayrat contains weak and fabricated hadiths, and prescribes things that are contrary to the truth, so it is not right for anyone to rely on this book.
Does the translation of the Quran count as the Quran itself?
A translation of the Quran in English or any other language is not counted as Quran itself, and the rulings that apply to Quran do not apply to it. The Quran is the Word of Allah which was revealed in the Arabic tongue.
Virtues of Surat al-Ikhlas
Al-Ahad (the One) and al-Samad (the Self-Sufficient) are two of the great Names of Allah .
Stating that Surat al-Ikhlas should be recited 500 times, and that the verse (interpretation of the meaning) La ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu min al-zalimin (None has the right to be worshipped except You [O Allah]. Glorified (and Exalted) are You. Truly, I have been of the wrong-doers) [al-Anbiya 21:87] should be recited 100 times is a practice that has no basis whatsoever in the Quran or the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so it is not right to adhere to these numbers. You should act upon the sound hadiths that describe the virtues of this surah and this verse. These reports include the following:
From Qatadah ibn al-Nu'man (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that a man stayed up to worship Allah at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) just before dawn and recited Qul huwa Allahu ahad, but did not recite anything else. In the morning, the man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him about this, thinking that perhaps he was not doing enough. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, it is equivalent to one-third of the Quran. (al-Bukhari, 4627).
Ahmad reported from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that a man said, O Messenger of Allah, I have a neighbour who prays at night and he only ever recites Qul huwa Allahu ahad as if he did not think much of this. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, it is equivalent to one-third of the Quran. (al-Musnad, 10965)
Abu Sa'id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to his Companions: Could any one of you not recite one third of the Quran in one night? They found the idea too difficult, and said, Who among us could do that, O Messenger of Allah? He said, Allahul-ahad, al- samad [i.e., Surat al-Ikhlas] is one third of the Quran. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 4628)
`Aishah reported that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went to bed, he would cup his hands together, blow into them and recite into them Qul huwa Allahu ahad [Surat al-Ikhlas], Qul a'udhu bi Rabbil-falaq [Surat al-Falaq] and Qul a'udhu bi Rabbil-nas [Surat al-Nas] (these are the last 3 surahs of the Quran). Then he would wipe as much of his body as he could with his hands, starting with his head and face, and the front of his body. He would do this three times. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 4630)
`Aishah also reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent a man in charge of a small military campaign, and when he recited Quran whilst leading his companions in prayer, he would always end with Qul huwa Allahu ahad. When they came back, (his companions) mentioned that to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who told them to ask him why he did that. So they asked him, and he said, Because it is a description of the Most Merciful, and I love to recite it. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Tell him that Allah loves him. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 6827)
'Abd al-Rahman ibn Abza reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite Sabbih isma Rabbik al-A'la (Surat al-A'la, #87), Qul ya ayyuhal-kafirun (Surat al-Kafirun, #109) and Qul huwa Allahu ahad (Surat al-Ikhlas, #112) in his witr prayer, and when he had finished, he would repeat Subhan al-Malik al-Quddus (Glory be to the King, the Holy) three times, making the last vowel long on the third recitation. (Reported by al-Nasai, 1721)
'Uqbah ibn 'Amir said: I met the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he said to me, O 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir, shall I not teach you some Surahs the like of which have not been revealed in the Tawrat (Torah) or the Zabur (Psalms) or the Injil (Gospel) or in the Quran? There is no night that comes but you should not recite (i.e., every night you should recite) Qul huwa Allahu ahad [Surat al-Ikhlas], Qul a'udhu bi Rabbil-falaq [Surat al-Falaq] and Qul a'udhu bi Rabbil-nas [Surat al-Nas]. 'Uqbah said: So every night I would recite them. It became my duty to recite them, because the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had commanded me to do so. (Musnad Ahmad, 16810)
Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) heard a man reciting Qul huwa Allahu ahad, and said, It is his right. They asked, O Messenger of Allah, what is his right? He said, Paradise is his right. (Reported by Imam Ahmad, 7669)
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever recites Qul huwa Allahu ahad ten times, Allah will build for him a house in Paradise. (Sahih al-Jami' al-Saghir, 6472).
So recite it as many times as you wish, without sticking to a certain number or time or way that is not prescribed by Shari`ah.
Virtues of “La ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu min al-zalimin”
With regard to the verse “La ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu min al-zalimin”, the following report has been narrated concerning its virtues:
Sa'd said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The call of Dhul-Nun [Yunus/Jonah], which he recited when he was in the belly of the fish, La ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu min al-zalimin. There is no Muslim who recites this in any situation, but Allah will respond to him. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 3427, and classed as sahih in Sahih al-Jami', 3383).
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Shall I not tell you of something which, if some of the misery and distress of this world befalls a man and he recites it, he will be relieved of his stress. It is the du'a of Dhul-Nun: La ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu min al-zalimin. (Reported by al-Hakim; Sahih al-Jami', 2605).

    and to preserve lineages (keep them legitimate). For this reason, marriage has been
    prescribed, and fornication, adultery, sodomy and lesbianism have been forbidden. All the
    things that may lead to the above have also been forbidden, such as looking at non-mahram
    women (women to whom one is not closely related), mixing with them or being alone with
    them. Dressing improperly and forming friendships with the opposite sex have also been
    forbidden. All of this is aimed at preventing the provocation of desires, and at directing
    desires into legitimate channels instead of letting them find forbidden means of
    expression. One of the principles of shareeah is that whatever leads to haraam deeds
    is itself haraam, so everything that leads to the provocation of haraam desires is haraam,
    because it may lead to a person falling into fornication and adultery. Once desire has
    been provoked, it invariably means that a person has to find a way of satisfying it, and
    so he or she commits a haraam act. Reading stories and magazines with sexual content, and
    looking at dirty pictures and movies provokes these kinds of desires and leads to haraam
    deeds, so they are not allowed. We should avoid them and keep away from them. Warn your
    friend about this and tell her to repent by keeping away from these things and getting rid
    of any bad books, movies etc. that she still has. She should feel remorse for the past,

There is no evidence in either the Quraan or Sunnah for ending duaas with al-Faatihah. Similarly, there is no evidence for blowing onto ones fingers and wiping the eyes with them after making duaa. Al-Shuqayri (may Allaah have mercy on him) mentioned the bidah of kissing the thumbnails and wiping the eyes with them after making duaa following salaah, or bunching the fingertips together and touching them to the eyes after prayer, and reciting certain things whilst doing so; he said that these are silly innovations.
(Al-Sunan wal-Mubtadaaat, p. 71). With regard to the question of kissing the Mus-haf (copy of the Arabic text of the Quraan), the Fatwa Standing Committee (al-Lajnah al-Daaimah lil-Iftaa) answered a question on this matter with the following fatwa: We know of no basis for kissing the Quraan. In another response to a similar question, they said: We know of no evidence that prescribes kissing the Quraan, which was revealed to be recited, respected, understood and acted upon. (Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daaimah, no. 4172)
In Al-Aadaab al-Shariyyah (2/273, Al-Risaalah edition), Ibn Muflih says:
It was reported that he (Imaam Ahmad) did not give an opinion [??] on this matter (kissing the Quraan) and touching it to one's forehead and eyes.
Al-Qaadi said in al-Jaami al-Kabeer: He did not give an opinion on that, although it contains an element of respect and honour, because in the case of deeds intended to draw closer to Allaah, if there is no comparable precedent in the Sunnah, then it is better not to do it. Do you not remember when Umar saw the Black Stone, he said: You cannot do any harm or any good. If it were not for the fact that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) kissed you, I would not kiss you.
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 1597; Muslim, 1270).
As for swaying when reciting Quraan or praying, this is habit of the Jews in their worship, so the Muslim should not do it deliberately.
(See Bida al-Qurra by Bakr Abu Zayd, p. 57). One of the ways of wisdom (hikmah) in dawah and combatting wrongdoing, to which you refer in your question, is to ask people for the evidence for what they are doing, because it is not permissible to worship in ways for which there is no evidence, as we have pointed out above. The burden of proof rests on the person who is doing the deed, not on the one who is seeking to correct him. May Allaah give us and you the strength to do good. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

    A Muslim cannot inherit from a kaafir, and a kaafir cannot inherit from a
    Muslim, because of the hadeeth reported in Saheeh al-Bukhaari, in which the Prophet
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Muslim does not inherit from
    the kaafir, and the kaafir does not inherit from the Muslim.” [This applies] even if

    Ayhaam al-Idtiraab an Aayaat al-Kitaab (p. 158):
The aayah (interpretation of the meaning) And,
    verily, a day with your Lord is as a thousand years of what you reckon [al-Hajj
    22:47] indicates that the length of a day with Allaah is a thousand years. The same is
    indicated by the aayah (interpretation of the meaning) He arranges (every) affair
    from the heavens to the earth, then it (the affair) will go up to Him, in one Day, the
    space whereof is a thousand years of your reckoning. [al-Sajdah 32:5]. Another
    aayah indicates something different (interpretation of the meaning): The angels
    and the Rooh [Jibreel] ascend to Him in a Day the measure whereof is fifty thousand
    years [al-Maaarij 70:4].
There are two ways in which these aayaat may be reconciled:
The first was reported by Ibn Abi Haatim via Sammaak from Ikrimah
    from Ibn Abbaas: the day of a thousand years mentioned in Soorat al-Hajj is one of
    the six days in which Allaah created the heavens and the earth; the day of a thousand
    years mentioned in Soorat al-Sajdah is the length of time it takes for a matter to go up
    to Allaah; and the day of fifty thousand years is the Day of Resurrection.
The second (way of reconciling the aayaat) is that what is meant by all
    of them is the Day of Resurrection, and the difference in the time span depends on whether
    a person is a believer or a kaafir. This is indicated by the aayah (interpretation of the
    meaning): Truly that Day will be a Hard Day, far from easy for the
    disbelievers. [al-Muddaththir 74:9-10]. These two suggestions were mentioned by
    the author of al-Itqaan. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
2273,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2273,The TenCommandments,"i'm trying to determine if there is anything in the Quran similar to the Ten Commandents in the Old Testament, particularly the line ""thou shalt not kill."" i have been using search functions on several Quran translation sites to no avail. thank you very much",,,"Praise be to Allah.Thank you for your question, which shows an interest in the Quran. We are happy to answer your question here.
There are in the Quran certain aayaat (verses) which some scholars call the verses of the Ten Commandments, because they include ten important commandments given by Allaah to mankind. These aayaat are to be found in two passages of the Quran.
The first is in Soorat al-Anaam, where Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
Say: Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited you from: Join not anything in worship with him; be good and dutiful to your parents; kill not your children because of poverty We provide sustenance for you and for them; come not near to al-fawaahish (shameful sins, illegal sexual intercourse, etc.), whether committed openly or secretly; and kill not anyone whom Allaah has forbidden, except for a just cause (according to Islamic law). This He has commanded you that you may understand.
And come not near to the orphan's property, except to improve it, until he (or she) attains the age of full strength; and give full measure and full weight with justice. We burden not any person, but that which he can bear. And whenever you give your word (i.e., judge between men or give evidence, etc.), say the truth even if a near relative is concerned, and fulfil the Covenant of Allaah. This He commands you, that you may remember.
And, verily, this (i.e., Allaah's commandments mentioned in the above two verses) is my Straight Path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His Path. This He has ordained for you that you may become al-muttaqoon (the pious). [al-Anaam 6:151-153]
The second passage occurs in Soorat al-Israa, and may be considered as a commentary on the passage quoted above. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them, but address them in terms of honour.
And lower unto them the wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say: My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was small.
Your Lord knows best what is in your inner-selves. If you are righteous, then, verily, He is ever Most-Forgiving to those who turn unto Him again and again in obedience, and in repentance.
And give to the kindred his due and to the poor and to the wayfarer. But spend not wastefully (your wealth) in the manner of a spendthrift.
Verily, spendthrifts are brothers of the shayaateen (devils), and the Shaytaan (Satan) is ever ungrateful to his Lord.
And if you turn away from them (kindred, poor, wayfarers, etc. whom We have ordered you to give their rights, but if you have no money at the time they ask you for it) and you are awaiting a mercy from your Lord for which you hope, then, speak unto them a soft kind word (i.e., Allaah will give to me and I will give to you).
And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, not stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty.
Truly, your Lord enlarges the provision for whom He wills and straitens (for whom He wills). Verily, He is Ever All-Knower, All-Seer of His slaves.
And kill not your children for fear of poverty. We provide for them and for you. Surely the killing of them is a great sin.
And come not near to unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a faahishah [i.e., anything that transgresses its limits (a great sin)], and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allaah forgives him).
And do not kill anyone which Allaah has forbidden, except for a just cause. And whoever is killed (intentionally with hostility and oppression and not by mistake), We have given his heir the authority [to demand qisaas Law of Equality in punishment or to forgive, or to take Diya (blood money)]. But let him not exceed limits in the matter of taking life (i.e., he should not kill except the killer only). Verily, he is helped (by the Islamic law).
And come not near to the orphan's property except to improve it, until he attains the age of full strength. And fulfil (every) covenant. Verily! The covenant will be questioned about.
And give full measure when you measure, and weigh with a balance that is straight. That is good (advantageous) and better in the end.
And follow not (O man, i.e., say not, or do not or witness not, etc.) that of which you have no knowledge. Verily! The hearing, and the sight, and the heart, of each of those you will be questioned by Allaah.
And walk not on the earth with conceit and arrogance. Verily, you can neither rend nor penetrate the earth, nor can you attain a stature like that of the mountains in height.
All the bad aspects of these (the above mentioned things) are hateful to your Lord.
This is part of al-hikmah (wisdom, good manners and high character, etc.) which your Lord has inspired to you (O Muhammad). And set not up with Allaah any other ilaah (god) lest you should be thrown into Hell, blameworthy and rejected (from Allaahs mercy). [al-Israa 17:23-39]
Perhaps after enjoying reading these verses, you will have a better idea of the Quraan than before, and this will be the beginning of a fundamental change in your life, the start of your way to Islam. May Allaah guide and help you always. Peace be upon those who follow true guidance.

2281,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2281,Signs of the Hour,"There are various sites regarding prophesies on the last days . The sites give very precise locations and happenings before the last day. Are they true ? . However in Quran there are prophesies but it does not mention the places. If there are any clear indications in Quran or in Hadith about Last Days, can you kindly tell.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Signs of the Hour are the signs that will precede Yawm al-Qiyaamah (the Day of Judgement) and indicate that it is nigh.
The Hour (al-Saa'ah) means the time of reckoning, and is either:
1. Saa'ah sughra (the lesser hour), which is a person's death, whereupon his reckoning starts when he leaves this world and passes into the Hereafter;
2. Or Saa'ah kubraa (the greater Hour), which is when mankind will be resurrected from their graves to be judged and rewarded or punished accordingly.
When the word al-saa'ah is used on its own in the Qur'aan, it refers to the greater reckoning (the Day of Judgement), as in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ""People ask you concerning the Hour"" [al-Ahzaab 33:63]
The Signs of the Hour (i.e., the Day of Judgement) are of two types:
1.    Ashraat al-Saa'ah al-Sughra (Minor signs of the Hour)
These are signs that will appear a long time before the Hour approaches, such as the decline of knowledge, the spread of ignorance, drinking of wine or alcohol, competition in the construction of tall buildings, and many others. The scholars have listed almost sixty signs, some of which will accompany the major signs, or will appear afterwards.
2.    Ashraat al-Saa'ah al-Kubraa (Major Signs of the Hour)
These are major signs that will appear shortly before the Day of Judgement comes. These extraordinary events will be:
(1)    The appearance of the Mahdi. At the end of time, a man from the descendents of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) will appear, and Allaah will help him to make His religion prevail. He will take control of the land (or the earth) and fill it with justice just as it had previously been filled with wrongdoing and oppression. Under his rule, the ummah will be blessed as it has never been blessed before.
This man's name will be like the name of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and his father's namewill be like the Messenger's father's name. He will be a descendant of Faatimah, the daughter of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), through the line of al-Hasan ibn 'Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him). He will appear from the East. A number of saheeh ahaadeeth refer to the appearance of the Mahdi, including the following:

1. Abu Sa'eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""During the last days of my ummah, the Mahdi will appear. Allaah will send rain for him, and the earth will bring forth its produce. He will give money sihaahan (according to one report, the Prophet was asked, ""What is sihaahan?"" and he said, ""Equally among people."" Reported by Ahmad), and livestock will increase He will live for seven or eight"" - meaning years. (Reported by al-Haakim, 4/557; he said it is saheeh according to the conditions of the two shaykhs [al-Bukhaari and Muslim]. Al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Shaykh al-Albaani said: its sanad is saheeh. Al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 711)
2. Umm Salamah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: ""I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: 'The Mahdi will be of my family (according to one report: of the people of my household) [Reported by Ibn Hibbaan and by al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak. He said: this hadeeth is saheeh according to the conditions of the two shaykhs, but they did not report it. Al-Dhahabi agreed with him] from the children of Faatimah."" [Reported by Abu Dawood, 11/373 and Ibn Maajah, 2/1368. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami', section 6610].
Al-'Allaamah al-Safaareeni said: ""So many reports were narrated concerning the appearance of the Mahdi that they reached the level of Tawaatur in meaning, and this became so well known among the scholars of Sunnah that it is counted as one of their basic beliefs."" (Lawaami' al-Anwaar al-Bahiyyah, 2/84).
[Tawaatur: a mutawaatir hadeeth is one that was narrated by so many people and transmitted by so many people that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed on a lie. Translator]
Imaam al-Shawkaani said: ""The mutawaatir ahaadeeth about the awaited Mahdi, which we managed to find and examine, number fifty, including saheeh, hasan and da'eef munjabir (weak ahaadeeth that are supported by corroborating evidence) reports. They are mutawaatir beyond any shadow of a doubt The reports from the Sahaabah that speak about the Mahdi are also very many and are judged as having the status of marfoo' ahaadeeth (i.e., ahaadeeth whose isnaads go back to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because this is not an issue in which they would have made ijtihaad."" (For more information, see Question #1252).

(2)    Al-Maseeh al-Dajjaal (The ""Antichrist"")
Al-Maseeh al-Dajjaal is a man from the sons of Aadam. He has a number of features which were mentioned in the saheeh ahaadeeth, including the following: he will be a young man with a ruddy complexion and curly hair, and will be one-eyed, with his right eye looking like a floating grape. Between his eyes will be written ""ka' fa' ra'"" (in unjoined letters) or ""kaafir"" (disbeliever), which every Muslim, literate or illiterate, will be able to read. Another of his attributes will be that he is sterile, and will have no children. Among the ahaadeeth that describe him are the following:
1. Ibn 'Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Whilst I was sleeping, (I dreamt that) I was doing Tawaaf around the House (the Ka'bah)."" He mentioned that he saw 'Eesaa ibn Maryam, upon whom be peace, then he saw the Dajjaal, and he described him: ""He is a well-built man, with a ruddy complexion and curly hair. He is one-eyed, with his eye looking like a floating grape. (Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said in al-Fath, 6/485: i.e., it is sticking out. The word yatfaa, with no hamzah, is used to describe something that is on top of something else. It is likened to a grape which is part of the bunch but sticks out from the rest. Al-Nawawi said: the word has been narrated both with the hamzah and without the hamzah. With the hamzah it means that the light has gone out of the eye, and without the hamzah it means that it is sticking out.) They said: ""This is the Dajjaal"" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 13/90, and Muslim, 2/237)
2. Ibn 'Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both) also reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) described the Dajjaal as living among people, and said: ""Allaah, may He be exalted, is not one-eyed, but al-Maseeh al-Dajjaal is one-eyed, and his right eye looks like a floating grape."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 13/90, and Muslim, 18/59)
3. 'Imraan ibn Husayn (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: ""I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: ""Between the creation of Aadam and the onset of the Day of Judgement, there will be a creation greater than the Dajjaal."" (Reported by Muslim, 18/86). [This means that] the Dajjaal will appear from the East, from Khurasaan, from among the Jews of Isfahaan, then he will travel around the world, leaving no country but he will enter it, except for Makkah and Madeenah, which he will not be able to enter because the angels are guarding them, as is reported in the hadeeth of Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with him): ""The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us that the Dajjaal would appear from a land in the East called Khurasaan."" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 6/495); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami', section 3398).

The fitnah (trial, tribulation) of the Dajjaal will be the greatest fitnah ever, seen from the time that Allaah created Aadam until the onset of the Day of Judgement, and this will be because of the power that Allaah will permit him to have, of working great miracles that will amaze and confuse the people. There are ahaadeeth that describe how he will have a ""paradise"" and a ""hell"", but his paradise will in fact be a hell, and vice versa. He will have rivers of water and mountains of bread. He will command the sky to rain, and it will rain, and he will command the earth to bring forth its produce, and it will bring forth its produce. The treasures of the earth will follow him, and he will travel though the earth at great speed, like rain driven by the wind.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught his ummah how they can protect themselves from the evil of the fitnah of the Dajjaal, as is reported in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah, may Allaah be pleased with him, who said that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""When any one of you pronounces the Shahaadah, let him seek refuge with Allaah from four things, and let him say: 'Allaahumma innee a'oodhu bika min 'adhaab jahannam, wa min 'adhaab al-qabr, wa min fitnati'l-mahyaa wa'l-mamaat, wa min sharri fitnati'l-maseeh al-dajjaal (O Allaah, I seek refuge with You from the punishment of Hell, from the punishment of the grave, from the trials of life and death, and from the evil of the tribulation of the Dajjaal)."" (Reported by Muslim, 5/87).
Another way of protecting oneself is by memorizing the first aayaat of Soorat al-Kahf. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined reciting the first verses of Soorat al-Kahf against the Dajjaal, by reciting the first ten verses, as was reported by al-Nawwaas ibn Sam'aan, who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Whoever of you encounters him (the Dajjaal), let him recite the first verses of Soorat al-Kahf against him."" (Reported by Muslim, 18/65). Abu'l-Dardaa' (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Whoever memorizes ten aayaat from the beginning of Soorat al-Kahf will be protected from the Dajjaal."" (Reported by Muslim, 6/92).
The destruction of the will come at the hands of 'Eesaa ibn Maryam, upon whom be peace, as is indicated in the saheeh ahaadeeth. 'Abd-Allaah ibn 'Amr (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: ""The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'The Dajjaal will emerge among my ummah and Allaah will send 'Eesaa ibn Maryam and he will pursue him and destroy him."" (Reported by Muslim, 18/75).

(3)    The descent of 'Eesaa ibn Maryam, upon whom be peace
After the Dajjaal has appeared and spread corruption throughout the earth, Allaah will send 'Eesaa ibn Maryam, upon whom be peace, who will descend to the earth, coming down to the white minaret in the East of Damascus, Syria, resting his hands on the wings of two angels. When he lowers his head, drops will fall, and when he raises it, drops like large pearls will fall (these are like grains of silver in the shape of big pearls, and it means that drops of water as pure as pearls will fall. The water is described as pearls because of its purity). No kaafir will smell his breath except he will die, and his breath will reach as far as his eyes can see. He will come down to the victorious group that is fighting for the truth and has come together to fight the Dajjaal. He will descend at the time when the iqaamah for prayer is being given, and he will pray behind the leader of that group.

The reports about his descent are many, including the following:
1. Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""By the One in Whose hand is my soul, it is nearly time for the son of Maryam to descend upon you, to judge fairly. He will break the cross, kill the pigs and put an end to war. Wealth will increase so much that no-one will accept it, and one prostration to Allaah will be worth more than the world and all that is in it."" Then Abu Hurayrah said: ""Recite, if you wish: 'And there is none of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) but must believe in him ('Eesaa - as a human Messenger of Allaah) before his ('Eesaa's) death. And on the Day of Resurrection, he ('Eesaa) will be a witness against them."" [Al-Nisaa'  4:159 - interpretation of the meaning].'"" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6/490, and Muslim, 2/189).
2. Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) also reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""How will you be when 'Eesaa ibn Maryam descends to you and your leader is one of you?"" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6/491, and Muslim, 2/193).
Imaam Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his Tafseer (7/223): ""Mutawaatir ahaadeeth from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) describe how 'Eesaa ibn Maryam will descend before the Day of Judgement as a just leader and fair ruler.""

(4)    Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj (Gog and Magog)
Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj are human beings, descended from Aadam and Hawwa, upon whom be peace. According to the descriptions of them given in the ahaadeeth, they belong to the Turkic Mongol race, having small eyes, small, flat noses and wide faces. Their faces look like hammered-out shields (their faces are likened to shields because they are wide and round).
Their appearance at the end of time is one of the signs of the Hour, as indicated in the Qur'aan (interpretation of the meaning): ""Until, when Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj are let loose (from their barrier), and they swiftly swarm from every mound. And the true promise (Day of Resurrection) shall draw near (to fulfilment). Then (when mankind is resurrected from their graves, you shall see the eyes of the disbelievers fixedly stare in horror. (They will say): 'Woe to us! We were indeed heedless of this; nay, but we were zaalimoon (polytheists and wrong-doers, etc.)."" [al-Anbiyaa' 21:96-97]
In the story of Dhoo'l-Qarnayn, Allaah tells us (interpretation of the meaning): ""Then he followed (another) way, until, when he reached between two mountains, he found, before (near) them (those two mountains), a people who scarcely understood a word. They said: 'O Dhoo'l-Qarnayn! Verily! Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj are doing great mischief in the land. Shall we then pay you a tribute in order that you might erect a barrier between us and them?' He said: 'That (wealth, authority and power) in which my Lord has established me is better (than your tribute). So help me with strength (of men), I will erect between you and them a barrier. Give me pieces (blocks) or iron,' then, when he had filled up the gap between the two mountain-cliffs, he said, 'Blow,' till when he had made it (red as) fire, he said, 'Bring me molten copper to pour over it.' So they [Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj] were made powerless to scale it or dig through it. (Dhoo'l-Qarnayn) said: 'This is a mercy from my Lord, but when the Promise of my Lord comes, He shall level it down to the ground. And the Promise of my Lord is ever true.' And on that Day [i.e., the day Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj will come out], We shall leave them to surge like waves on one another, and the Trumpet will be blown, and We shall collect them all together."" [al-Kahf 18:92-99]
Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj are also mentioned in the Sunnah, in more than one hadeeth, including the following:
1. Umm Habeebah bint Abi Sufyaan reported from Zaynab bint Jahsh that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) entered upon her one day in a nervous state, saying, ""La ilaaha ill-Allaah! Woe to the Arabs from the evil that has approached! Today a hole this big has appeared in the barrier of Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj,"" and he made a circle with his thumb and forefinger. Zaynab bint Jahsh said, ""O Messenger of Allaah, will we be destroyed even though there are righteous people among us?"" He said, ""Yes, if evil becomes widespread."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6/381, Muslim, 18/2).
2. Al-Nawaas ibn Sam'aan (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported a long hadeeth describing several signs of the Hour. In this hadeeth, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: "" and Allaah will send Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj, swiftly swarming from every mound. They will pass the lake of Tiberias [in Palestine] and will drink everything that is in it. Then the last of them will pass by and will say, 'There used to be water here once.' The Prophet of Allaah, 'Eesaa, and his companions, will be besieged until a bull's head will be more precious to one of them than a hundred dinars are to any of you today. 'Eesaa and his companions will pray to Allaah, and Allaah will send a kind of worm (like that found in the noses of camels and sheep) on their (Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj) necks, and they will fall down dead, all at once. Then 'Eesaa and his companions will come down out of the place where they were besieged, and they will find hardly a handspan of land that is not filled with the stench (of Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj), so 'Eesaa and his companions will pray to Allaah, and He will send birds like the necks of camels to carry them away and throw them wherever Allaah wills."" (Reported by Muslim, 18/68).

(5)    The swallowing up of the earth
This means that a place is swallowed up in the earth and disappears into it, as is described in the Qur'aan (interpretation of the meaning): ""So We caused the earth to swallow him and his dwelling place"" [al-Qasas 28:81]. Among the major signs of the Hour will be three such events, as described in the hadeeth of Hudhayfah ibn Usayd (may Allaah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""The Hour will not begin until you see ten signs (including) three events where the earth swallows up, one in the East, one in the West, and one in the Arabian Peninsula."" (Reported by Muslim, 18/27).

These events, like other major signs of the Hour, have not happened yet. Although other instances of places being swallowed up by the earth have occurred at various times and in various places, they did not cover so wide an area as to include both East and West. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: ""There have been instances of places being swallowed up by the ear, but it could be that what is meant by the three events referred to is events that are worse than anything yet seen, which could be more intense and cover a larger area."" (Fath al-Baari, 13/84).

(6)    The smoke
Another of the major signs of the Hour will be the appearance of the smoke. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke, covering the people, this is a painful torment."" [al-Dhukhaan 44:10-11]. A definition of the smoke was narrated from Ibn 'Abbaas, who explained that it is one of the Signs of the Day of Judgement, as was narrated by Ibn Jareer and Ibn Abi Haatim from 'Abd-Allaah ibn Abi Maleekah, who said: ""I went to Ibn 'Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) one day, and he said: 'I did not sleep at all last night.' I asked him, 'Why not?' He said, 'They said that a star with a tail (a comet) had appeared, and I was afraid that the smoke had started, so I could not sleep at all.'""
Imaam Ibn Katheer commented: ""This is a saheeh isnaad, going back to Ibn 'Abbaas, the scholar of the ummah and the interpreter of the Qur'aan. This is also the opinion of all the Sahaabah and Taabi'een who agreed with him, in addition, there are many ahaadeeth going back to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) - saheeh, hasan and others - which state the same thing. This is convincing evidence that the smoke will be one of the expected signs, as is also clear from the text of the Qur'aan."" (Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 7/235).
Among the ahaadeeth that describe the appearance of the smoke as one of the signs of the Hour is the following:
1. Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Hasten to do good deeds before six things appear: the Dajjaal, the smoke"" (Reported by Muslim, 18/87)
(7)    The rising of the sun from the West
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): "" The day that some of the Signs of your Lord do come, no good will it do to a person to believe then, if he believed not before, nor earned good (by performing deeds of righteousness) through his faith"" [al-An'aam 6:158]. Most of the mufassireen (commentators) state that one of these signs is the rising of the sun from the West. Among the reports that indicate this are:
1. The hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) according to which the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""The Hour will not begin until the sun rises from the West, and when it rises and the people see it, they will all believe, but that will be when it will do a person no good to believe, if he believed not before, nor earned good (by performing deeds of righteousness) through his faith."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 11/352, and Muslim, 2/194).
2. The hadeeth of 'Abd-Allaah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'Aas (may Allaah be pleased with them both), who said: ""I learned from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) a hadeeth that I have never forgotten since. I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: 'The first of the signs of the Hour to appear will be the rising of the sun from the West.'"" (Reported by Muslim, 18/78).

(8)    The appearance of the Beast
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""And when the Word (of torment) is fulfilled against them, We shall bring out from the earth a beast to them, which will speak to them because mankind believed not with certainty in our aayaat."" [al-Naml 27:82]
Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: ""The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'There are three things which, once they happen, it will do a person no good to believe, if he believed not before, nor earned good (by performing deeds of righteousness) through his faith: the rising of the sun from the West, the Dajjaal, and the Beast of the earth.'"" (Reported by Muslim, 2/195).
Abu Umaamah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""The Beast will emerge, and it will mark all the people on their noses, and this mark will last, so that if a man buys a camel, and is asked who he bought it from, he will say, 'From the man with the mark on his nose.'"" (Reported by Ahmad and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, no. 322).
According to some reports, when the Beast appears, it will mark the believers and the kaafirs. As for the believer, it will make his face shine brightly, as a sign of his faith, and as for the kaafir, it will mark his nose with a sign of his disbelief.
The Qur'aan tells us that the Beast will speak to people, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""And when the Word (of torment) is fulfilled against them, We shall bring out from the earth a beast to them, which will speak to them because mankind believed not with certainty in our aayaat."" [al-Naml 27:82]. This kalaam may refer to actual speech, whereby the Beast will address people, which is supported by the reading of Ubayy ibn Ka'b (tunabbi'uhum, i.e., tell them), or it may convey the other meaning of the word kalaam, to wound, which is supported by the alternative reading (taklamuhum, i.e., mark them by cutting them) reported from Ibn 'Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him).
(9)    The fire which will gather the people together
Another of the signs of the Hour is the great fire which will appear from the direction of Yemen, from the bottom of 'Aden, from the Sea of Hadramawt. Among the ahaadeeth that describe this are the following:
1. The hadeeth of Hudhayfah ibn Usayd which mentions the major signs of the Hour, in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: "" The last of them will be a fire which will emerge from Yemen, and will drive the people to their gathering place."" According to another report: "" and a fire which will emerge from the bottom of 'Aden and drive the people (ahead of it)."" (Reported by Muslim, 18/27).
2. The hadeeth of Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) which states that when 'Abd-Allaah ibn Salaam embraced Islam, he asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about a number of issues, including the first sign of the Hour. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""The first sign of the Hour will be a fire which will drive the people from East to West."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6/362).
3. Ibn 'Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: ""The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'Fire will emerge from Hadramawt or from the sea of Hadramawt (according to another report: from the direction of Hadramawt or from Hadramawt - Mishkaat al-Masaabeeh) before the Day of Judgement, and it will drive the people (ahead of it).'"" (Reported by Ahmad, 7/133; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami', 3603).
A number of saheeh ahaadeeth describe how this fire will gather the people together. Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""The people will be gathered in three ways, willingly or by force, two on one camel, or three or four or even ten on one camel. The rest of them will be gathered together by means of a fire, which will stay with them whenever they stop to rest or to sleep, no matter what the time of day or night."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 11/377, Muslim, 17/194).
Finally, it should be noted that belief in the signs of the Hour is part of our belief in the Unseen (al-ghayb), without which the belief of the Muslim is incomplete. And Allaah is the Source of Strength..",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
2282,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2282,Dealing with a person whose sin repeatedly hurts one,"Asslamualaikum
If a person commits a sin which hurts you, and they repeatedly do it what should one do ??",,,"Praise be to Allah.What you should do is advise the person who is committing sin, whether the sin hurts you directly or not, because enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil is an important obligation which Muslims are supposed to do all the time, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And when a community among them said: ‘Why do you preach to a people whom Allaah is about to destroy or to punish with a severe torment?’ (the preachers) said: ‘In order to be free from guilt before your Lord (Allaah), and perhaps they may fear Allaah.’” [al-A’raaf 7:164]
In his tafseer (commentary) of this aayah, Ibn Katheer said: “Here Allaah is describing how the people of that town had split into three groups: those who committed sin by using tricks to catch fish on the Sabbath (which Allaah had forbidden them to do), those who told them not to do this wrong deed and boycotted them, and those who kept quiet, neither committing the sin not speaking out against it. But this third group said to those who were telling the sinners not to do it: ‘Why do you preach to a people whom Allaah is about to destroy or punish with a severe torment?’ i.e., why do you warn these people when you know they are doomed and they deserve to be punished by Allaah, and your telling them not to do it is of no benefit? The preachers said to them, ‘In order to be free from guilt before your Lord (Allaah),’ i.e., we are doing this out of obedience to your Lord, Who has instructed us to enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil; ‘and perhaps they may fear Allaah,’ i.e., perhaps this warning may make them stop what they are doing and return to Allaah in repentance, for if they repent, Allaah will accept their repentance and have mercy on them.”
The Muslim should use different styles of warning and calling people to Islam. Sometimes he uses a soft and encouraging tone, describing the rewards for obedience; sometimes he warns of the punishment for disobedience; sometimes he may tell stories which illustrate an important lesson; sometimes he explains the bad consequences of sin on the person’s life, and so on.
If a person can no longer bear to be close to this sinner, and there is no benefit in advising him, then he should keep away from him and have nothing to do with him. And Allaah is the source of strength and the Guide to the right path.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Ruling on wine made from vinegar


Why is it not permissible to change wine to vinegar


References","Praise be to Allah.What is vinegar?
Vinegar is a well-known basic foodstuff, made from wine of which the composition has changed so that it is no longer sweet but is acidic or sour.
Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “What a good food vinegar is.” (Reported by Muslim, 3/1623)
Ruling on wine made from vinegar
When wine turns to vinegar by itself, without any deliberate treatment needed for it to be changed, it is permissible to eat, drink and handle, according to the consensus of the scholars, because of the hadith quoted above.
But if the wine has become vinegar because of deliberate treatment, by adding vinegar, onions, salt etc., or by any other process, in this case the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differ as to whether it is permissible.
The Shafi’is, Hanbalis and some of the Malikis say that it is not permissible to deliberately change wine to vinegar because then it is not pure. The evidence for this is the hadith of Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked whether wine could be changed to be used as vinegar. He said, ‘No.’” (Reported by Muslim).
Abu Talhah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about some orphans who had inherited some wine. He said, “Pour it away.” He was asked, “Could they not make it into vinegar?” He said, “No.” (Reported by Muslim).
Why is it not permissible to change wine to vinegar
The reason for this is:
Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has commanded us to avoid wine. Keeping it and treating it until it turns into vinegar means handling it and being involved with it by storing it and benefiting from it, and this is not permitted.
It is permitted for a Muslim to buy vinegar from someone who is selling it, unless he realizes or comes to know that it was produced by means of a deliberate process. ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “… There is nothing wrong with a man buying vinegar from the people of the Book, if they sell it, so long as he knows that they did not deliberately process it from wine.” (Al-Mughni, 8/330)

    religion which Allaah has commanded us to adhere to. What is even more distressing is the
    fact that a Muslim woman would have a relationship (of any kind) with a non-related
    Christian man for ten years, when she knows that this is something which angers Allaah,
    Who has forbidden believing women to do such things in the Quran (interpretation of
    the meaning):  they should be chaste, not adulterous, nor taking
    boyfriends [al-Nisaa 4:25]. Equally upsetting is the fact that what
    this Muslim girls father fears most  with regard to the marriage described
     is not Allaah, but what his mother will say and how his reputation among his
    relatives will be affected.
In any case, there is no way out of this problem now except one: this
    man must become Muslim in a real sense, and start to practise Islam, and he and this girl
    should repent for what they have done. Then marrying him will be permissible, and what
    people may say does not matter, so long as everything is done in accordance with Islam and
    in a way that will not earn the anger of Allaah; the matter can also be explained to close

    and it is not a condition that the phrase should be used in full, because when a written
    abbreviation is used, what the writer means is the complete expression. So when a person
    says “wa’l-salaam,” what he or she means is “wa’l-salaamu
    ‘alaykum.” But if the person sending the letter writes “wa’l-salaamu
    ‘alayka” or “wa’l-salaamu ‘alaykum” at the end,
    this is better. Umar ibn al-Khattaab ended his letter to the qaadi Shurayh with the words
    “wa’l-salaamu ‘alayka” [Sunan al-Nisaa’i, 5304] and
    ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ended his letter to one of his workers in the same
    way [Muwatta’ Malik, Kitaab al-jihaad].
Ibn Katheer reported in al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah from Ibn
    ‘Asaakir that Ziyaad ibn Abi Sufyaan sent Sa’eed ibn al-‘Aas gifts, money
    and a letter proposing marriage to his daughter. When the gifts, money and letter arrived,
    [Sa’eed] read the letter, shared out the gifts among the people sitting with him,
    then wrote a nice, polite letter back to him in which he said: “In the name of
    Allaah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. Allaah says: ‘Nay! Verily man does
    transgress all bounds (in disbelief and evil deeds, etc.), because he considers himself
    self-sufficient.’ [al-‘Alaq 96:6-7 – interpretation of the meaning]. Wa’l-salaam.”
However, the person sending the letter should greet the addressee with the
    complete phrase (“Al-salaamu alaykum”) at the beginning of the letter, as

    kinship, even if they are not as one would like them to be, because Allaah says
    (interpretation of the meaning): “And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and
    good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and
    hardship, and his weaning is in two years – give thanks unto Me and to your parents,

    them”, He said, “but behave with them in the world kindly…”
Upholding the ties of kinship is obligatory even if the relatives are
    not as one would like them to be. So you must keep in touch with your relatives even if
    they have this dish, which most people use to view haraam things, waste their time and
    money, and corrupt their morals and minds.
If they use the dish to watch haraam things when you are present, then
    do not go to them so that you will not be a partner in their sin, but still we advise
    people to pay attention to their duties towards their relatives, which include advising
    them, i.e., going to them and explaining to them that this – watching haraam things
    – is haraam. Then you will have done your duty of advising them and treating them
    well.

The Muslim must also pay attention to his children when

    watching these haraam things; he can strive to make other, permissible forms of
    entertainment available (such as some sports activities or games or useful computer games,
