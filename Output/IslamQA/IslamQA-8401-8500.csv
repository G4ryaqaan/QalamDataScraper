Having lived so away from home for such a long time, I often find that I need guidance with the persuite of knowledge of Islam, our great guid in life. I am wondering the virtues a woman should look for in a potential husband, more specific than for him to be a practicing moslem. As well, I regard the role of motherhood as a very precious and sacred one, any advice on having a good moslem household and rearing children to be all they can be and close to our faith? I would appreciate any comments You would have regarding this topic... Curiously yours,",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly, we advise you to go to one of the nearby mosques or Islamic centres, and try to go there as often as possible. This will let you get to know some righteous sisters and benefit from what you hear from them.
The man whom a woman agrees to marry should be committed to Islam and should adhere to its rulings and morals. Other attributes and characteristics are a matter concerning which people differ.
With regard to the education and upbringing of children, one of the most important factors in their upbringing is creating a good environment for them. This includes choosing a suitable husband; choosing a suitable home, in an area among righteous people and people with whom one would like to make friends; choosing suitable schools for them; keeping the means of corruption out of the home; having a good relationship between the husband and wife; husband and wife being in agreement concerning matters of child-rearing so that there will not be any conflict or contradiction between them. It is also important for the parents to read some suitable books on raising childre, to learn from those whom they think have raised their children well, and to set a good example to the children.",Shaykh Muhammad al-Duwaysh

      two wives, and spending on children of one wife from a previous marriage","I am married to two wives.  I am not quite sure how to be fair towards them regarding financial issues.  They both live in different houses.  One has 2 children from a different marriage, and the other has one son from our marriage.  Do I have a financial obligation towards those children who are not mine?  The two households spend different amounts of money on basic necessities (food, electricity, gas, transportation....), how can I be fair towards both and that is the case?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Treating
      wives equally with regard to spending money and time is waajib
      (obligatory), unless one of them agrees to forego some of her rights in
      favour of the other. It is also waajib to treat the children equally, but
      you do not have to spend on the children from a different marriage unless
      there is no one to spend on them, in which case their expenses are an
      obligation on all the Muslims, of whom you are one.
      
      
 If
      their accommodation differs in terms of basic necessities because one of
      the families is larger than the other, there is nothing wrong with that,
      but the additional spending involved should be related to the larger
      number of individuals concerned.

      of ‘aqeeqah meat","i
      want to know what is a'aqqeqa ( the qurbani which has to be done after the
      birht of a son ) two goats or sheep. and the meat--how is it distributed ?
      does it have three(3) shares as for eid-qurbani or is it all for the
      family ?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Some
      of the scholars said that the ‘aqeeqah is like the udhiyah (qurbaani)
      and is subject to the same rulings.
They
      said that it should be shared out in the same manner as the udhiyah, and
      that the conditions for the sheep to be sacrificed for the ‘aqeeqah are
      the same as those in the case of udhiyah. They said that it should not be
      blemished, lame, obviously sick or extremely weak.
      
      Ibn Qudaamah said:
      
      The
      way it is to be eaten (by the owner), given as gifts and given in charity
      is the same, i.e., the way in which the ‘aqeeqah is to be (shared out)
      is the same as the way in which the udhiyah is (shared out). This is the
      view of al-Shaafa'i. 
Ibn Seereen said:
Do
      whatever you want with the meat. Ibn Jurayj said: It should be cooked in
      salt and water, and given to neighbours and friends, but nothing of it
      should be given in charity. Ahmad was asked about this, and he quoted the
      view of Ibn Seereen, which indicates that this was also his view. He was
      asked whether one could eat it, and he said, I did not say that he should
      eat all of it and not give any of it in charity.
      
      The more correct view is to liken it by analogy (qiyaas) to udhiyah
      because it is a sacrifice which is prescribed in sharee’ah, but it is
      not obligatory, so it is like udhiyah, and because it is like it in terms
      of the attributes, age, value and conditions [of the animal] , so it is
      like it in terms of the manner in which it is disposed of.
      
      (al-Mughni,
      9/366)
       
      
      Al-Shawkaani
      said:
Do
      the same conditions apply (to ‘aqeeqah) as to udhiyah? Al-Shaafa'i has
      two views, and he quoted evidence to show that this is not the case, and
      that is the correct view.
(Nayl
      al-Awtaar, 5/231).
      
      
      And he
      mentioned differences between ‘aqeeqah and udhiyah which indicate that
      they are not alike in all regards. So there is no mention in the Sunnah of
      a specific way of dividing (the meat of the ‘aqeeqah). The purpose is to
      draw closer to Allaah by means of the shedding of this blood, in
      thanksgiving for the blessing of the newborn child, and to loosen the
      bonds of the Shaytaan over the child and to remove him from him, as is
      indicated in the hadeeth, “Every child is ransomed by his ‘aqeeqah.”
      
      With regard to the ruling on the meat, you may do whatever you like with
      it. If you wish, you and your family can eat it, or you can give it in
      charity, or you can eat some and give some. This is the view of Ibn
      Seereen and of Imaam Ahmad, may Allaah have mercy on him.

8424,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8424,She wants to be a good Muslim,"I want to become a real good muslim, how do I start off? I do not mean to say that I am a bad muslim right now. But I do not read all five Salats or cover myself the proper Islamic way either. So how do I start?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Real Islam means adhering to the rulings of Islam, one of the most important of which is salaah (prayer), which is the “pillar of the religion” and is the first thing for which a person will be questioned  about when he is brought to account on the Day of Resurrection. Prayer is the covenant that distinguishes the believers from the kaafirs, and whoever neglects a prayer is committing an act of kufr.
Therefore what you have to do is to pray regularly on time, and not miss any of the prayers. Then you must adhere to the other rulings of Islam, which include hijaab. What will help the Muslim to do that is to read Qur’aan regularly, and read the seerah (biography) of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and stories of righteous people. We advise you to choose righteous friends from among the Muslim women, because this will help you, if Allaah wills, to adhere firmly to the religion of Allaah.
You should also check yourself, in obedience to the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning):
“O you who believe! Fear Allaah and keep your duty to Him. And let every person look to what he has sent forth for the morrow, and fear Allaah…”
[al-Hashr 59:18]
Here Allaah commands us twice to fear Him (taqwa), and in between these two commands, He commands us to check ourselves. So look and see what you have sent forth for the Day of Judgement in the way of good deeds and abstaining from evil deeds. This checking is an important means of changing oneself, and the Day of Resurrection will be difficult and long, and will make the faces look horrible (from their extreme dislike of it) (cf. Al-Insaan 76:10). So look at what you have prepared in the way of good deeds and try to do more of them and be sincere in doing them. Give up sin, for it is the worst thing that one can prepare for that Day. Make sure that you go into the Hereafter with the best that you have. And do not forget to make du’aa’ and ask Allaah to guide you to the Straight Path and help you to remain steadfast in it.

“Forbidden to you (for marriage) are: … two sisters in wedlock at the same time, except for what has already passed” [al-Nisaa’ 4:23]
It was reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade marrying a woman then her paternal aunt, or a paternal aunt then her brother’s daughter, a woman then her maternal aunt, or a maternal aunt then her sister’s daughter, or an older sister then the younger sister, or a younger sister then the older sister.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, no. 1045; Abu Dawood, no. 1768.

    when she was an orphan and he does not want her to wear hijaab in front of him","I am a female. and, me and my brother are
      both adopted. We were brought into the house when we were only a few days old. We lived
      our lives with our adoptive parents, not knowing our conditon. After practicing Islam, I
      came to know that i was adopted. My age is now XXX. I lived with my parents until 18, then
      i married. My husband told me that i must start to wear hijaab in front of my father, and
      that he is not considered a mahram. We aksed, and someone said that we are Rabaa'b that
      Allah mentioned in the Qur'an and that hijaab need not be done. We did not feel
      comfortable and after asking further, we came to believe that He is not my Mahram, and
      that I must do hijab. My adoptive father and mother are both very emotional people.
      Whenever i mentioned adoption before, they imediately started to cry and could not talk.
      This happens all the time. Me and my husband were both scared that they would take this very badly,
      so we decided that we would be subtle in the way we took this issue. When i visited my
      adoptive parents last, i covered my hair with a type of pakistani scarf which is not
      transparent, giving the excuse that many people work around the house. Also, i did not
      wear a jilbaab, but wore lose clothes, Qamees and Sharwaal. Also i ate at the table, and
      also freely talked to my adoptive father. In front of all other non mahrams, i fully cover myself in black, even
      cover my eyes, and do not talk to men without necessity.Allah knows that the reason i am not doing full hijab is because of my
      adoptive parents would react. They are old Father XXX, mother XXX, and they are weak in
      their imaan in that they would not be able to understand nor accept this ruling in Islam.
      My father tries to pray, but misses it much, and my mother prays regularly, though missing
      some and making them up.What am I supposed",,,"Praise be to Allah.We have to accept the rulings of sharee'ah and put them into

  relationship of mahram, either by blood or by radaa'ah (breastfeeding)(see Question 
  #5538) between you and the person who 
  sponsored you and brought you up, you have to observe hijaab in front of this 
  person. (For the conditions of hijaab according to sharee'ah, see Question #6991).

8489,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8489,Is the hijaab only for a specific class of women?,"Is this true that -- ""Honorable or good muslim women wear hajab But low class muslim women don't""? This is the understanding of few muslims in my community. They base their understanding from the following hadith. Please clarify. I'm producing the hadith for your convinience. This hadith is recorded in the Sahih of Al-Bukhari with the following wording: The Companion Anas ibn Malik narrates: The Prophet stayed for three rights between Khaibar and Medina and was married to Safiya. I invited the Muslims to his marriage banquet and there was neither meat nor bread in that banquet but the Prophet ordered Bilal to spread the leather mats on which dates, dried yogurt and butter were put. The Muslims said amongst themselves, ""Will she (i.e. Safiya) be one of the mothers of the believers, (i.e. one of the wives of the Prophet ) or just (a lady captive) of what his right-hand possesses?"" Some of them said, ""If the Prophet makes her observe the veil, then she will be one of the mothers of the believers (i.e. one of the Prophet's wives), and if he does not make her observe the veil, then she will be his lady slave."" So when he departed, he made a place for her behind him (on his camel) and made her observe the veil. Few thing I'd like to know more are time frame of this incident, before or after the revelation of Al-Ahzab( 33:59) etc. I'm seeking your opinion as par on-line hadithsearch's recommendation.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The hadeeth came after the revelation of the hijaab and after it was made obligatory  for the believing women. But the full hijaab is only for free women; slaves and concubines should not resemble free women by wearing the full hijaab. A slave woman does not have to cover her face, and ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) used to forbid them to do so.

8490,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8490,Are      the ahaadeeth about matters of the unseen revelation (wahy) from Allah?,"I have a question regarding hadith. I know the Prophet (saaw) never spoke from his own desires about the deen so how did he know information about stuff like the signs of the dat of judgement and so on? Did Allah (swt) tell him all these things?
Please clearify this matter for me. Thank you",,,"Praise be to Allah.Everything that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has told us about the unseen, past, present and future, such as the beginning of creation, the resurrection, Paradise, Hell, the signs of the Hour, the angels and the Prophets, all of that is by revelation (wahy) from Allah, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Nor does he speak of (his own) desire. It is only a Revelation revealed” (al-Najm 53:3-4)
 “This is of the news of the Unseen which We reveal unto you (O Muhammad)” [Hood 11:49]
 “Say (O Muhammad): ‘I don’t tell you that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor (that) I know the Unseen; nor I tell you that I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me.’” [al-An’aam 6:50]
 Hence it is obligatory to believe everything that Allah has told the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning the unseen and other matters, for he is the one who tells the truth and is to be believed. Whoever disbelieves him, even if it is with regard to only one report that he knows to be sound (saheeh), becomes an apostate thereby, if he is Muslim.

8492,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8492,What is the meaning of      the angels prostrating to Adam and Yoosuf’s brothers prostrating to him?,"Why did Allah tell the angels to bow to Adam? I thought boing was only allowed for Allah alone. The same goes for Prophet Yusuf, why did his brothers bow to him?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Prostrating is of two kinds:
 It may an act of veneration and drawing closer to the one to whom one prostrates. This kind of prostration is worship, and should only be done for Allah, according to the laws of the Prophets.
 The second type is a kind of greeting and honouring a person. This is the kind of prostration which Allah commanded the angels to do in the case of Adam, so they prostrated to him as an act of honouring him. It was an act of worship towards Allah on their part, because they were obeying His command to prostrate to Adam.
 The prostration of Yoosuf’s parents and brothers was also a prostration of greeting and honouring, which was permissible according to the law (of Allah) at that time. But according to the sharee’ah brought by the Seal of the Prophets, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), it is not permissible to prostrate to anyone at all except Allah. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If I were to have commanded anyone to prostrate to anyone else, I would have commanded women to prostrate to their husbands.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade Mu’aadh to prostrate to him when he (Mu’aadh) said that the People of the Book prostrated to the great ones among them, and he mentioned the hadeeth quoted above. The prohibition in this sharee’ah against prostrating to anyone at all except Allah is an aspect of its perfection in achieving true Tawheed. It is the perfect sharee’ah whose perfection is manifested in all its rulings. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
