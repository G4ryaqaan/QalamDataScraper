Detailed reasons for punishment in the grave","Praise be to Allah.There are many reasons for which people may be punished in their graves , which Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) listed and said:  
Some people may wonder about the reasons for which people may be punished in their graves . This may be answered in two ways: in general and in detail. 
General reasons for punishment in the grave
In general terms, they may be punished for their ignorance of Allah , their ignoring His commands and their disobedience towards Him. Allah does not punish any soul that acknowledged Him, loved Him, obeyed His commands and heeded His prohibitions, nor does He punish the body that was inhabited by that soul.   
Punishment in the grave and in the Hereafter is due to the wrath and anger of Allah towards His slave. Whoever angers Allah in this world and does not repent, and dies like that, will be punished in al-Barzakh to a level commensurate with Allah's anger with him. 
Detailed reasons for punishment in the grave

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us about two men whom he saw being punished in their graves. One of them used to walk around spreading malicious gossip among people, and the other failed to take precautions to avoid getting urine on himself. So the latter failed to purify himself as required, and the former did something that creates enmity among people by talking, even if what he says is true. 
Thus it may be noted that the one who stirs up enmity by telling lies and making false statements will be punished even more. 
Failing to keep oneself clean from urine indicates that the one who neglects prayer, for which cleansing oneself from urine is a requirement and condition will be punished even more. In the hadith of Shu’bah it says: “One of them used to eat the flesh of people,” which refers to backbiting or malicious gossip. 

According to the hadith of Ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) a man was struck with a whip and his grave was filled with fire because he offered a single prayer without having purified himself, and he passed by one who was being wronged and did not help him.  

According to the hadith of Samurah in Sahih al-Bukhari, a person who told a lie that spread far and wide was punished. 
A man who read the Quran then slept at night and did not act upon it by day was punished. 
Adulterers and adulteresses are punished. 
The one who consumes riba is punished in al-Barzakh, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) testified. 
According to the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), the heads of some people will be crushed with rocks because they were too heavy for them to get up and pray. 
Some will graze on al-dari’ and al-zaqqum (horrid types of food in Hell) because they withheld the zakah of their wealth. 
Some will eat putrid, rotten meat because of their zina. 
Some will have their lips cut off with iron scissors because they caused fitnah (fighting, civil war) with their words and their speech. 

According to the hadith of Abu Sa’id, those who committed these crimes will be punished. Some of them will have bellies as big as houses; they are those who consumed riba. Some will open their mouths and have stones thrown into them that will emerge from their nether regions; they are the ones who consumed orphans’ wealth. Some will be hung up by their breasts; they are the adulterers. Some will have their sides cut and will be fed with their own flesh; they are the ones who engaged in backbiting. Some will have nails of copper with which they will scratch their faces and chests; they are the ones who impugned people’s honour. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that the one who stole a cloak from the war booty will be wrapped in a cloak of fire in his grave. This is despite the fact that he was entitled to a share of the booty, so how about those who wrong others unlawfully? 
The punishment of the grave is for sins of the heart, the eye, the ear, the mouth, the tongue, the stomach, the private parts, the hand, the foot, and the entire body.

Those who spread malicious gossip, tell lies, backbite, give false witness, slander those who are chaste and innocent, spread fitnah, promote bid’ah (innovation), say things about Allah and His Messenger without knowledge, and speak in a reckless manner. 
Those who consume riba, consume orphans’ wealth and consume haram wealth such as bribes and the like. 
Those who consume the wealth of their Muslim brothers unlawfully, or the wealth of non-Muslims living under Muslim protection, or consume intoxicants. 
Adulterers, homosexuals, thieves, traitors, betrayers and plotters. 
Those who consume riba , those who pay it, those who record it and those who witness it; those who enter into a marriage merely to divorce the woman so that it will become permissible for her to return to her former husband, and those for whom this is done; those who seek to waive the duties enjoined by Allah and transgress His sacred limits.  
Those who seek to harm the Muslims and seek to expose their faults. 
Those who rule by something other than that which Allah has revealed, those who issue rulings based on things which Allah has not prescribed, and those who help others in sin and transgression. 
Those who kill souls whom Allah has forbidden us to kill, those who deny the names and attributes of Allah, those who give their opinions and ideas precedence over the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah. 
Those who wail for the dead and those who listen to them, those who will wail in Hell are those who sing songs that are forbidden by Allah and His Messenger and those who listen to them. Those who build mosques over graves and set up lamps in them; those who try to take more when they take what they are owed and try to give less when they give what they owe.  
Tyrants, the arrogant, those who show off, slanderers and backbiters, those who slander the salaf. 
Those who go to soothsayers, astrologers and fortune tellers to ask them things and believe what they say. 
Those who help wrongdoers, who have sold their Hereafter for the sake of others in this world. 
Those who, if you remind them to fear Allah do not pay any heed, but if you try to scare them by mentioning another person like themselves, they pay heed and refrain from what they are doing. 
Those who are told of the words of Allah and His Messenger but they do not pay any attention to it, but if they hear it from one of whom they think well of, who may be right or wrong, they seize it and do not go against it. 
Those to whom Quran is recited but they are not affected by it, and it may be burdensome for them, but when they heard the “Quran” of the shaytan or that which calls to zina (i.e., music) and words of hypocrisy, they feel good and it cheers them up, and they wish that the singer would not stop. 
Those who swear by Allah and tell lies, but when they swear by their shaykhs or relatives, or the life of one whom they love and respect, they will not lie, even if they are threatened and tortured. 
Those who boast of their sins in front of their brothers. 
Those from whom you do not feel that your possessions and dignity are safe. Those who engage in obscene speech, whom people shun for fear of their evil. 
Those who delay prayer until the end of its time, and then peck out the prayer, remembering Allah but little therein. Those who do not pay the zakah of their wealth willingly. Those who do not perform Hajj even though they are able to, and do not do the duties required of them even though they are able to. 
Those who are not cautious with regard to what they look at or say or eat or where they go, and they do not care what wealth they acquire, whether it is halal or haram. 
Those who do not uphold the ties of kinship or show compassion towards the poor, widows, orphans, or animals, rather they forsake orphans and do not urge others to feed the poor. They show off to people, withhold small kindnesses, and seek out people’s faults and sins whilst ignoring their own. 

All of these and their ilk will be punished in their graves for these sins, according to how great or small they were. Because most people are like this, most of the inhabitants of the graves will be punished, and those who succeed will be very few. 
The outside of the grave is just earth, but inside it is regret and torment. 
The outside may be earth and carved stones, whilst inside it is disaster and calamity, boiling with grief and sorrow like a kettle, and no wonder, when they no longer get what they want of their desires and wishes. 
There are lessons in this world which need no further exhortation. 
It calls out: O dwellers of the earth, you have focused on building a realm that will soon pass away, and you have neglected the realm to which you are moving quickly. You have built houses in which others will live and enjoy them, and you have neglected houses for which there are no other inhabitants but you. 
This is the place where you will abide and bid farewell to work and toil. This is what matters, one of the gardens of Paradise or one of the chambers of Hell.” (Al-Ruh, 95)

45359,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45359,Effect of Dad Travelling on Kids,"I travel a great deal. I travel far away from my children for a year or two, then I come back and stay with them for one month, then I travel again, and so on. All of this is for the sake of earning money and providing for my children. In recent years I noticed that their attitude has started to become bad, and I fear that they may go astray. 

What should I do? Should I keep on travelling in order to earn money, or should I stop travelling and go back to them?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    You should note that Allaah has placed a trust on the 
    shoulders of every father, and a responsibility concerning which he will be 
    questioned on the Day of Resurrection. The Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) said: “Each of you is a shepherd and is responsible 
    for his flock. The ruler is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. The 
    man is the shepherd of his family and is responsible for his flock. The 
    woman is the shepherd of her husband’s household and is responsible for her 
    flock.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2409; Muslim, 1829. 

    The first thing that the father should pay attention to, 
    regarding his children, is their religious commitment and morals; this will 
    lead to their salvation in this world and in the Hereafter. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families 
    against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are 
    (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the 
    Commands they receive from Allaah, but do that which they are commanded”

    [al-Tahreem 66:6]

    ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib said: This means: teach them and 
    discipline them. 

    And before the responsibility of earning money and spending 
    on them comes the greater responsibility of ensuring that they be saved in 
    the Hereafter from the punishment of Allaah. 

    There are brilliant examples of men who fulfilled this trust 
    and did that which Allaah had enjoined upon them with regard to their wives 
    and children. 

    There is a man who wakes his wife up to pray during the last 
    third of the night, and at Fajr he wakes up his children and takes them to 
    the mosque and sits with them, remembering Allaah and reading Qur’aan until 
    the sun comes up. 

    Another has the habit of taking his sons with him to the 
    mosque to perform the five daily obligatory prayers, and when they have 
    finished ‘Asr prayer he stays with them in the mosque, teaching them the 
    Qur’aan and how to memorize it and recite it properly (tajweed), and what it 
    means, then they all go home together. 

    But unfortunately there are many fathers who do not do that 
    which Allaah has enjoined upon them of taking care of their family’s 
    religious commitment and all they care about is looking after their worldly 
    affairs. 

    There are some fathers who, if their child falls sick and his 
    temperature rises a little, they panic and go looking for a doctor and a 
    remedy, which is all well and good, and is an act of compassion towards the 
    child, but what is strange is that they do not care if their children commit 
    haraam (unlawful) actions, even major sins that may doom one to Hell. 

    How high is the temperature of Hell? 

    How can they fear a slight rise of temperature in their 
    child, and not worry about the fire of Hell? 

    There are some fathers who, if their child is falling behind 
    in his studies and not keeping up with their classmates, go crazy and lose 
    sleep, and worry a great deal until they bring a tutor who can help the 
    child advance in his studies. 

    But if the children neglect their prayers or do something 
    haraam, or commit a major sin, they do not blame them in that case. 

    Some fathers get very angry if their child transgresses one 
    of their rights or ignores one of their commands, but they do not care if 
    the child transgresses one of the rights of Allaah or disobeys one of His 
    commands. 

    If a father neglects his children and does not teach them the 
    Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger and does not raise them 
    according to the basic tenets of faith and Islamic behaviour, undoubtedly 
    his children will go astray and will go out into society as weak and deviant 
    personalities, and the first ones to suffer from their corruption and 
    deviance will be this father and this mother who fell short in raising their 
    children. 

    Hence our advice to you, if you think that your travelling 
    and being far away from your children will affect their upbringing and cause 
    them to go astray, is to go back to them and try to raise them properly. 

    What will it benefit you or your children if you amass wealth 
    for them but they become deviant and corrupt? 

    If you look around you, you will see many examples of men who 
    travelled and left their children behind, and who suffered alienation and 
    loneliness for the sake of amassing wealth for their children, then they 
    came back with the money, but they lost something that is more important 
    than wealth, they lost their children, because the children went astray as a 
    result of their father’s absence and their mother’s negligence. 

    The children do not appreciate what their fathers did for 
    their sake, and they take the money and start to curse them and mistreat them, 
    and even hit them sometimes, so the fathers regret deeply the fact that they 
    travelled and were so far away from their children… but what good is regret 
    when so much time has passed? 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    was asked about the heads of families travelling. He replied: 

    With regard to the heads of families travelling, if their 
    travel will cause harm to their families, then they should not travel, 
    because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “It is sufficient sin for a man that he should neglect those who are 
    dependent on him.” Classed as hasan (sound) by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 
    1692.  Whether they will be harmed because of little maintenance or because of 
    their weakness, it is haraam (impermissible) for such a person to travel. If they will not 
    be harmed, but they will feel sad and will miss him, then if there is no 
    real benefit in travelling which brings a greater reward than his staying 
    with them, such as knowledge which he fears he will miss out on or a 
    knowledgeable person he has to meet with, then it is better for him to stay 
    with them. But if it is like the travel of many people, which is just for 
    the purpose of leisure and filling time, then it is better for him to stay 
    and worship Allaah at home in all cases. The person who is in this situation 
    should consult a knowledgeable person who knows him and what is best for him 
    and who is trustworthy, because people’s situations vary greatly with regard 
    to such matters. And Allaah knows best. 

    From Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 28/28. 

    We ask Allaah to guide you and to help you to do that which 
    is best for you and your children.

45365,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45365,How could Yoosuf have “inclined towards” the wife of al-‘Azeez when he was chaste?,"What is the tafseer of this verse in Soorat Yoosuf (interpretation of the meaning):  

“And indeed she did desire him, and he would have inclined to her desire”

[Yoosuf 12:24]? 

If Yoosuf (peace be upon him) was chaste and refused to answer the call of the wife of al-‘Azeez, how could he have inclined towards her desires (i.e., how could that have entered his mind)?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And indeed she did desire him, and he would have inclined 
    to her desire, had he not seen the evidence of his Lord”

    [Yoosuf 12:24]
Her desire was to commit 
    sin, but as for Yoosuf (peace be upon him), if he had not see the evidence 
    of his Lord, he would have inclined to her desire – because of human nature 
    – but he did not, because of the evidence mentioned. 

    Because he hadseen seen the evidence of his Lord, he did not 
    incline to her desire. 

    Abu Haatim said: I used to recite ghareeb al-Qur’aan 
    to Abu ‘Ubaydah, and when I reached the verse (interpretation of the 
    meaning): “And indeed she did desire him, and he would have inclined to 
    her desire” [Yoosuf 12:24], Abu ‘Ubayd said: This is to be understood as 
    meaning that he saw the proof of his Lord, and so he did not incline to her 
    desire. 

    Al-Qurtubi, al-Jaami’ li Ahkaam al-Qur’aan, 9/165. 

    Al-Shanqeeti said in Adwa’ al-Bayaan (3/58): 

    This may be answered from two angles: 

    1 – That what is meant by saying “Yoosuf would have inclined 
    to her desire” is that a thought crossed his mind, but the influence of 
    taqwa (piety) deflected that thought. One of them said: this is the natural 
    inclination and the instinctive desire that is restrained by taqwa. There is 
    no sin in that because this is something that is instilled in man and is not 
    under his control. It says in the hadeeth that the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to divide his time equally among his 
    wives and treat them fairly, then he would say: “O Allaah, this is how I 
    divide that over which I have control, so do not take me to task for that 
    which is beyond my control” – meaning the inclination of the heart. [Abu 
    Dawood, al-Sunan, hadeeth no. 2134. 
This is like the fasting 
    person’s inclination towards cold water and food, while at the same time his 
    taqwa prevents him from drinking or eating whilst he is fasting. 

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “Whoever thinks of an evil action but does not do it, one hasanah will 
    be recorded for him.” [Narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh, no. 
    6491; Muslim, no. 207] 

    2 – Yoosuf (peace be upon him) did not think of doing 
    anything at all, because he was prevented  from doing so because of the 
    proof of his Lord. This view which was favoured by Abu Hasaan and others is 
    more correct according to the rules of the Arabic language. 

    Then he started to quote the evidence to support the view he 
    favoured. Based on the above, the meaning of the verse – and Allaah knows 
    best – is that if Yoosuf (peace be upon him) had not seen the proof of his 
    Lord, he would have inclined towards her desire, but because he had seen the 
    proof of his Lord he did not incline towards her desire and did not think of 
    it at all. Similarly, just thinking of something without doing it is not 
    regarded as a sin. And Allaah knows best. May Allaah send blessings and 
    peace upon his noble Prophet.",Islam Q&A
