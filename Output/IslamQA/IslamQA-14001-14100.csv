Some say that it is permissible, some say that it is forbidden, and some say that we cannot comment either way. Among those who said that we cannot comment either way was Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him). The researcher thought that the view of the majority of modern scholars is most likely to be correct, but subject to certain conditions, namely: 
(a)urgent need, i.e., when it is not possible to achieve pregnancy by natural means
(b)the doctor dealing with the case should think it most likely that no harm will be caused by doing this procedure
(c)there should be no room for sperm (lit. lineages) to be mixed
The ruling on the case mentioned is the same as the ruling on a case where sperm is taken from a man and an egg from his wife, then the egg is fertilized in a test tube and returned to the uterus. The most correct view is that this is permissible, subject to the conditions mentioned above.","Majallah al-Da’wah, issue no. 1796, p. 20"

14007,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14007,Our attitude towards Yazeed ibn Mu’aawiyah,"I heard of this person Yazeed Ibn Muawiyah. I heard that he once a calipha of the muslims and he was a drunken sadistic person, who was not really a muslim. Is this true? Please tell me his story. Thank you and may allah bless you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.His name was Yazeed ibn Mu’aawiyah ibn Abi Sufyaan ibn Harb ibn Umayaah al-Umawi al-Dimashqi.
Al-Dhahabi said: he was the commander of that army during the campaign against Constantinople, among which were people such as Abu Ayyoob al-Ansaari. Yazeed was appointed by his father as his heir, so he took power after his father died in Rajab 60 AH at the age of thirty-three, but his reign lasted for less than four years.
Yazeed is one of those whom we neither curse nor love. There are others like him among the khaleefahs of the two states (Umawi/Umayyad and ‘Abbaasi/Abbasid) and the governors of various regions, indeed there were some among them who were worse than him. But the issue in the case of Yazeed is that he was came to power forty-nine years after the death of the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him); it was still close to the time of the Prophet and some of the Sahaabah were still alive such as Ibn ‘Umar who was more entitled to the position than him or his father or his grandfather.
His reign began with the killing of the martyr al-Husayn and it ended with the battle of al-Harrah, so the people hated him and he was not blessed with a long life. There were many revolts against him after al-Husayn, such as the people of Madeenah who revolted for the sake of Allaah, and Ibn al-Zubayr.
(Siyar A’laam al-Nubalaa’, part 4, p. 38)
Shaykh al-Islam described people’s attitudes towards Yazeed ibn Mu’aawiyah, and said:
The people differed concerning Yazeed ibn Mu’aawiyah ibn Abi Sufyaan, splitting into three groups, two extreme and one moderate.
One of the two extremes said that he was a kaafir and a munaafiq, that he strove to kill the grandson of the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to spite the Messenger of Allaah and to take revenge on him, and to avenge his grandfather ‘Utbah, his grandfather’s brother Shaybah and his maternal uncle al-Waleed ibn ‘Utbah and others who were killed by the companions of the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), by ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib and others on the day of Badr and in other battles – and things of that nature. To have such a view is easy for the Raafidis who regard Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and ‘Uthmaan as kaafirs, so it is much easier for them to regard Yazeed as a kaafir.
The second extreme group think that he was a righteous man and a just leader, that he was one of the Sahaabah who were born during the time of the Prophet and were carried and blessed by him. Some of them give him a higher status than Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, and some of them regard him as a prophet. Both views are obviously false to one who has the least common sense and who has any knowledge of the lives and times of the earliest Muslims. This view is not attributable to any of the scholars who are known for following the Sunnah or to any intelligent person who has reason and experience.
The third view is that he was one of the kings of the Muslims, who did good deeds and bad deeds. He was not born until the caliphate of ‘Uthmaan. He was not a kaafir but it was because of him that the killing of al-Husayn happened, and he did what he did to the people of al-Harrah. He was not a Sahaabi, nor was he one of the righteous friends of Allaah. This is the view of most of the people of reason and knowledge and of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah.
Then they divided into three groups, one which cursed him, one which loved him and one which neither cursed him nor loved him. This is what was reported from Imaam Ahmad, and this is the view of the fair-minded among his companions and others among the Muslims. Saalih ibn Ahmad said: I said to my father, some people say that they love Yazeed. He said, O my son, does anyone love Yazeed who believes in Allaah and the Last Day? I said, O my father, why do you not curse him? He said, O my son, when did you ever see your father curse anybody?
Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi said, when he was asked about Yazeed: according to what I have heard he is neither to be cursed nor to be loved. He said, I also heard that our grandfather Abu ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Taymiyah was asked about Yazeed and he said: we do not deny his good qualities or exaggerate about them. This is the fairest opinion.

14011,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14011,"Soundness of the Hadeeth, “Learn witchcraft (sihr).”","How sound is the hadeeth which I heard, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Learn witchcraft (sihr), but do not use it.”?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    This hadeeth is 
    false and has no basis. It is not permissible to learn witchcraft or to use 
    it. It is an evil action and is kufr (disbelief) and misguidance. Allah 
    clearly stated that witchcraft is forbidden in His Book, where He says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “They followed 
    what the shayateen (devils) gave out (falsely of the magic) in the lifetime 
    of Sulayman. Sulayman did not disbelieve, but the shayateen (devils) 
    disbelieved, teaching men magic and such things that came down at Babylon to 
    the two angels, Haroot and Maroot, but neither of these two (angels) taught 
    anyone (such things) till they had said, ‘We are for trial, so disbelieve 
    not (by learning this magic from us).’ And from these (angels) people learn 
    that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife, but they 
    could not thus harm anyone except by Allah’s leave. And they learn that 
    which harms them and profits them not. And indeed they knew that the buyers 
    of it (magic) would have no share in the Hereafter. And how bad indeed was 
    that for which they sold their ownselves, if they but knew.

    And if they had 
    believed and guarded themselves from evil and kept their duty to Allah, far 
    better would have been the reward from their Lord, if they but knew!” 
    [2:102-103] 

    In these verses, 
    Allah clearly states that witchcraft is kufr and that it is from the 
    teachings of the devils. Allah has condemned them for it, and they are our 
    enemies. And He has stated that teaching witchcraft is kufr and that it is 
    harmful and not beneficial, so we must beware of it. 

    Learning 
    witchcraft is all kufr, hence He stated that the two angels did not teach it 
    to people until they had told them (what means), “We are for trial, so 
    disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).”  Then He says (what 
    means), “but they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah’s leave” so it 
    is known that it is kufr and misguidance, and that the practitioners of 
    witchcraft cannot harm anyone except by Allah’s leave. What is meant is His 
    universal qadari will (i.e., things that He decrees should happen even 
    though He may dislike them), not His religious shar’i will (i.e., that which 
    He prescribes and which pleases Him) – because Allah has not prescribed this 
    and has not given permission for it in His sharee’ah; rather He has 
    forbidden it and stated that it is kufr and is from the teachings of the 
    devils. And He has stated that whoever buys it – i.e., learns it – will have 
    no share in the Hereafter. This is a serious warning. Then Allah says (what 
    means): “And how bad indeed was that for which they sold their ownselves, if 
    they but knew” – what is meant is that they have sold themselves to the 
    devils for this witchcraft. Then Allah says (what means), “And if they had 
    believed and guarded themselves from evil and kept their duty to Allah, far 
    better would have been the reward from their Lord, if they but knew!” – this 
    indicates that learning witchcraft and using it is the opposite of faith and 
    piety. There is no power and no strength except with Allah.","Majmoo’ Fatawa wa Maqalat Mutanawwi’ah li’l-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 6/371"

    fighting the kuffaar and for that reason. See al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, Kuwait edition, 26/272 
The majority of scholars said that the 
    funeral prayer should not be offered for him. That is the view of Imam Maalik and al-Shaafa’i, and the more correct of the two views narrated from 
    Imam Ahmad. See al-Mughni, 2/334. That is because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not pray for the martyrs 
    of Uhud (narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1347), and because the purpose behind the funeral prayer is to intercede for the deceased. But the martyr 
    receives expiation for everything (so he has no need of intercession), apart from debt; debt is not waived because of martyrdom, rather it remains 
    owed by the deceased. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: 
It is not prescribed to offer the funeral 
    prayer for the martyrs who die in battle, or to wash them, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not offer the 
    funeral prayer for the martyrs of Uhud, neither did he wash them. This was narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh (1347) from Jaabir ibn 
    ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him). 
Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 
    13/162 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy 
    on him) said: 
No one among the people – neither the imam nor anyone else – should offer the funeral prayer 
    for the shaheed, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not offer the funeral prayer for the martyrs of Uhud, 
    and because the purpose behind the funeral prayer is to intercede for the deceased. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “There is no Muslim man who dies, and forty men who do not associate anything in worship with Allaah offer the funeral prayer for him, but 
    their intercession with Allaah for him will be accepted.” But the martyr receives expiation for everything apart from debt, because debt cannot be 
    waived by martyrdom, rather it remains owed by the deceased and is to be paid off from his estate if he left anything behind. Otherwise if he took 
    it with the intention of paying it back, Allaah will pay it back on his behalf. 
Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 
    5/367 
Some of the scholars were of the view that it 
    is permissible to offer the funeral prayer for the shaheed – but it is not obligatory. This was narrated from Imam Ahmad (see al-Mughni, 
    2/334). That is because of the following ahaadeeth: 
1 – It was narrated from Shaddaad ibn al-Haad 
    that a man from among the Bedouin came to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and believed in him and followed him, then 
    he said: “I will migrate with you.” They stayed there for a while, then they engaged in fighting the enemy. He was brought to the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he had been struck by an arrow… Then the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    shrouded him in his cloak, then he placed him in front of him and offered the funeral prayer for him. 
Narrated by al-Nasaa’i; classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani in Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz, p. 82 
2 – It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Zubayr that on the day of Uhud, the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ordered that Hamzah be wrapped in his cloak, then he offered the funeral prayer for him. 
    He said takbeer nine times, then the slain were brought and laid in rows, and he offered the funeral prayer for them and for him with them.

14014,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14014,Does a Wet Dream Invalidate Your Fast?,"When I was fasting in Ramadan I slept after Fajr, and I had ISTIHLAM (Dream of sexual intercourse) and I had maniy (clear liquid) coming out. My question is: Would my fasting for that day be accepted if I continued, even though I didn't have control over it? 
My second question is that: those kinds of dreams come from the Iblis, but Iblis is locked in the skies in Ramadan. What is your response?","Having a wet dream while fasting does not invalidate the fast. This is a matter that is beyond a person’s control, and he cannot prevent it.","Wet dream while fasting


Sinning during Ramadan","Praise be to Allah.Wet dream while fasting
Having a wet dream during the day in Ramadan does not invalidate the fast. This is a matter that is beyond a person’s control, and he cannot prevent it. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope”[al-Baqarah 2:286]
“If a man experiences a wet dream this does not invalidate his fast, because it was involuntary on his part; it is similar to the case when something enters his throat whilst he is sleeping.” (See al-Mughni by Ibn Qudamah, vol. 3, p. 22) 
The Standing Committee was asked about a man who had a wet dream during the day in Ramadan – what is the ruling on that? They replied: 
“Whoever has a wet dream whilst he is fasting or is in a state of ihram for Hajj or ‘Umrah, there is no sin on him and he does not have to offer expiation (kafarah). It does not affect his fast, but he does have to do ghusl to cleanse himself from janabah (impurity) if maniy (semen) was emitted.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, vol. 10, p. 274) 
Ihtilam (wet dream) means seeing intercourse in one’s dream. 
This is one of the things that Allah has created in human nature for men and women alike. Hence it was narrated from Umm Salamah, the Mother of the Believers, that she said: “Umm Sulaym, the wife of Abu Talhah, came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, verily Allah is not shy of (telling you) the truth. Is it necessary for a woman to take a bath (ghusl) after she has a wet dream?’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘Yes, if she notices a discharge.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, al-Ghusl, 373; Muslim, al-Hayd, 471) 
What is meant by a wet dream is when a person who is sleeping imagines intercourse. 
And al-Bukhari narrated from Abu Salamah that Abu Qutadah al-Ansari said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: ‘Dreams come from Allah and bad dreams come from the Shaytan. So if any one of you sees a dream that he dislikes, let him spit drily to his left side and seek refuge with Allah from it, and it will not harm him.” (al-Ta’bir, 6488; Muslim, al-Ruya, 4196). This does not mean that the Shaytan is the one who causes that. 
Sinning during Ramadan
The fact that the marids (strong jinns) are chained up during Ramadan does not mean that the devils stop whispering into people’s hearts and urging them to do evil; but that happens to a lesser extent in Ramadan than in other months. The effects of this are well known and can be seen. 
Ibn Hajar said: 
“The fact that bad dreams are mentioned in conjunction with the Shaytan means that they share his characteristics of lying and exaggeration, etc., unlike true dreams which are mentioned in conjunction with the name of Allah by way of honour, even though all of them are created and decreed by Allah.” (Fath al-Bari, 12/393)

Can husband give ghusl to dead wife?","Praise be to Allah.Can wife give ghusl to dead husband?
It is permissible for a woman to see her husband after he dies , and for her to wash him, according to the correct scholarly opinion, which says that either spouse may wash the other after death , even if there is someone else who could wash them. 
`Aishah said: “If we could go back and change anything, no one would have washed the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) but his wives.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud)
Abu Bakr al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) left instructions in his will that he should be washed by his wife Asma bint ‘Umays, and she did that. 
Abu Musa was washed by his wife Umm ‘Abd-Allah.
Can husband give ghusl to dead wife?
It is also permissible for a man to wash his wife when she dies , according to the correct scholarly view, because it was narrated by Ibn al-Mundhir that ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) washed Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) after she died. That was well known among the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) and no one denounced him for that, thus there was consensus on this point.

14017,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14017,Weak and fabricated ahaadeeth narrated by the Sufis,"Is this hadeeth which is mentioned by the Sufis saheeh – “My heaven and my earth could not contain Me, but the heart of My believing slave contains Me”?",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was asked about the words 
          which were narrated from the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “My heaven and my earth 
          could not contain Me, but the heart of My believing slave contains Me”?
 
           He replied: 
 
          What they mentioned is from the Israa’eeliyyaat 
          [reports narrated from Jewish sources], no isnaad is known for it from 
          the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). What it means is that Allaah 
          puts love and knowledge of Himself in the heart of His slave. 
 
          The report, “The heart is the house of the Lord” is like 
          the first report. The heart is the home or seat of faith in Allaah and 
          of knowledge and love of Him.
 
           They reported the words, “I was an unknown treasure 
          and I wanted to be known, so I created mankind and taught them about 
          Myself so that they would know Me.” These are not the words of the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and I know of no isnaad 
          for this, either saheeh (sound) or da’eef (weak). 
 
          They reported that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah created reason, 
          and said to it, ‘Come here,’ and it came. He said to it, ‘Go there,’ 
          and it went. He said, ‘By My Glory and Majesty, I have not created anything 
          more noble than you. I shall reward and punish because of you.’” This 
          hadeeth is baatil (false) and mawdoo’ (fabricated) according to the 
          consensus of hadeeth scholars. 
 
          They narrate the words, “Love of this world is the root 
          of all evil.” This is known from Jundub ibn ‘Abd-Allaah al-Bajali, but 
          there is no known isnaad from the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
 
          They report the words, “This world is merely a step for 
          the believing man.” This is not known from the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or from the salaf of this 
          ummah or its imams. 
 
          They report the words, “Whoever is blessed with a thing, 
          let him stick with it” and, “Whoever commits himself to something, let 
          him stick with it.” The first report was narrated from one of the salaf. 
          The second report is baatil (false), for whoever commits himself to 
          something may have to stick to it or he may not, according to what Allaah 
          and His Messenger have commanded. 
 
          They report that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Do favours for the 
          poor, for tomorrow they will have authority, and what authority!” and, 
          “Poverty is my pride and I boast of it.” Both of these are lies and 
          are not known in any way in the well known books of the Muslims. 
 
          They report that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I am the city of 
          knowledge and ‘Ali is its gate.” This hadeeth is da’eef (weak); indeed 
          it is mawdoo’ (fabricated) according to the scholars of hadeeth. It 
          was narrated by al-Tirmidhi and others, but it is a lie. 
 
          They report that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “The poor will sit 
          down on the Day of Resurrection, and [Allaah] will say, ‘By My Glory 
          and Majesty, I did not deprive you of worldly things because you are 
          insignificant. Rather I wanted to raise your status on this Day. Go 
          to the place where the people are standing, and whoever gave you a piece 
          of bread, or water to drink, or clothes to wear, take him to Paradise.’” 
          The shaykh said: this report is a lie which was not narrated by any 
          of the scholars of hadeeth. It is baatil (false) and goes against the 
          Qur’aan and Sunnah and scholarly consensus (ijmaa’). 
 
          They report that when the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to Madeenah, the daughters 
          of al-Najjaar came out with daffs (hand-drums) and sang “Tala’a al-Badru 
          ‘alayna min thaniyyat al-Widaa”, and the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to them, “Shake your 
          tambourines, may Allaah bless you.” The hadeeth about women beating 
          the daff on joyous occasions is saheeh, and this was done at the time 
          of the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but it is not known that 
          he said, “Shake your tambourines.” 
 
          They report that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “O Allaah, You have 
          brought me out of the place which is most beloved to me, so cause me 
          to dwell in the place which is most beloved to You.” This hadeeth is 
          also baatil (false), although it was narrated by al-Tirmidhi and others. 
          Rather he said to Makkah, “You are the most beloved part of Allaah’s 
          land to me.” And he said, “You are the most beloved land to Allaah.” 
 
          They report that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever visits me 
          and my father Ibraaheem in one year will enter Paradise.” This is a 
          fabricated lie which was not narrated by any of the scholars of hadeeth. 
 
          They report that a Bedouin prayed (quickly), pecking 
          (like a bird) in his prayer. ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) said, 
          “Do not peck in your prayer.” The Bedouin said, “O ‘Ali, if your father 
          had pecked in prayer he would not have entered Hell.” This is a lie. 
 
          They report that ‘Umar killed his father. This is a lie, 
          for his father died before the mission of the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) began. 
 
          They report that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “I was a Prophet when 
          Adam was between the water and the clay. I was a Prophet when Adam was 
          neither water nor clay.” This wording is false. 
 
          They report the words, “The bed of a single man is fire. 
          Poor is the man who has no woman and the woman who has no man.” These 
          are not the words of the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
 
          It was narrated that when Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) 
          built the Ka’bah, he prayed one thousand rak’ahs in each corner, then 
          Allaah revealed to him, “O Ibraaheem, this is not like feeding a hungry 
          man or clothing a man who cannot cover his ‘awrah.” This is obviously 
          a lie, and it is not known in the books of the Muslims. 
 
          They narrate the words, “Do not despise tribulation, 
          for it will reap the hypocrites.” These words are not known from the 
          Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
 
          They narrate the words, “Whoever teaches his brother 
          an aayah from the Book of Allaah becomes his master.” This is a lie 
          which is not known at all in the books of the scholars. 
 
          They narrate that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “I looked at the sins 
          of my ummah and I did not find any greater sin than that of one who 
          learns an aayah then forgets it.” If this hadeeth is saheeh, what is 
          meant is forgetting in the sense of not reciting. The wording of the 
          hadeeth is: “Among the sins of my ummah is that of a man to whom Allaah 
          gave an aayah of the Qur’aan, but he neglected it until he forgot it.”  
          This forgetting means turning away from the Qur’aan and not believing 
          in it or acting upon it. With regard to neglecting to study it until 
          one forgets it, this is a sin. 
 
          They report the words, “One aayah of the Qur’aan is better 
          than Muhammad and the family of Muhammad. The Qur’aan is the word of 
          Allaah, revealed not created, and there is nothing like it.” This wording 
          was not reported from the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
 
          They report that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever learns something 
          beneficial and conceals it from the Muslims, Allaah will bridle him 
          with reins of fire on the Day of Resurrection.” A similar meaning is 
          to be found in al-Sunan: the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Whoever is asked 
          about a matter of [Islamic] knowledge which he knows but he conceals 
          it, Allaah will bridle him with reins of fire on the Day of Resurrection.” 
 
          They report that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “When you come to 
          talk about disputes which took place among my companions, be quiet. 
          When you come to talk about the Divine will and decree (al-qadaa’ 
          wa’l-qadar), keep quiet.” This was reported with munqati’ (broken 
          or interrupted) isnaads. 
 
          They report that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Salmaan al-Farsi 
          when he was eating grapes, “Du, du,” meaning eat them two by 
          two. These are not the words of the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him); this is baatil (false). 
 
          They report that the Prophet

          (fornication) with a woman and she gives birth to a girl, the fornicator 
          may marry his daughter who was born as a result of zina.” This was said 
          by those who were not among the companions of al-Shaafa’i. Some of them 
          attributed it to al-Shaafa’i, and some of the companions of al-Shaafa’i 
          denied that he said that. They said, he did not state that this is permitted, 
          but he did state that this is permissible in the case of radaa’ah (breastfeeding), 
          if he breastfed from the milk of a woman who got pregnant as a result 
          of zina. Most of the scholars, such as Ahmad, Abu Haneefah and others, 
          are agreed that this is haraam, and this is the stronger of the two 
          opinions narrated in the madhhab of Maalik. 
 
          They report the words, “the most deserving thing for 
          which you take payment is the Book of Allaah.” Yes, it is proven that 
          [the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)] said, “The most deserving 
          thing for which you take payment is the Book of Allaah,” but that was 
          in the hadeeth about ruqyah (reciting Qur’aan and du’aa’s for the purpose 
          of healing), and the reward was for the recovery of that sick person, 
          not for the recitation. 
 
          They report that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Whoever mistreats 
          a dhimmi (a Jew or Christian living under Islamic rule), Allaah will 
          be his opponent on the Day of Resurrection” or “I will be his opponent 
          on the Day of Resurrection.” This is da’eef (weak). What is known from 
          him is that he said: “Whoever kills a mu’aahid (member of a kaafir nation 
          which has a peace treaty with the Muslims) for no lawful reason will 
          not smell the fragrance of Paradise.”

          lamp in the mosque, the angels and the bearers of the Throne will not 
          cease to pray for forgiveness for him so long as the light of that lamp

    in front of a kaafir woman according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions. Some scholars said that a Muslim woman should observe 
    hijab in front of kaafir woman, quoting as evidence the verse in Soorah al-Noor where Allaah forbids the Muslim women to show their adornment to 
    anyone except their husbands. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“…and not to reveal their adornment except

Some scholars said that “their women” 
    means believing women; if the women are kaafirs then the believing woman should not reveal her adornment to them. Others said that “their women” 
    means the feminine gender, whether they are believing women or not. This is the more correct view. So the Muslim woman does not have to observe 
    hijab in front of a kaafir woman, because it was proven that Jewish women in Madeenah at the time of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of

The father of this family took the responsibility of walayah (my family is not Muslim) - in looking for an appropriate husband for me, making arrangements for my accomodations, provision, and Islamic education.  As we began to go through potential husbands, he became aware that he had most of the qualities I was looking for.  He first discussed it with his wife, and then several months later opened the subject with me.  

However, his first wife made it clear to me that she didn't want the marriage to take place. I requested another brother to take the role of wali for me, and on his advice, and the advice of other learned people who know him and his family, and after much istikhara, the marriage took place.  My question is two parts - Now, the first wife is claiming that my marriage to her husband is ungratefulness for all of the kindness she had previously shown me, and that I oppressed her by responding to her husband's proposal without consulting her, and by accepting the marriage with the knowledge that she wasn't happy with it.  

1. Is her claim valid?  Have I oppressed her, and did our former friendship create a relationship between us that should have prevented me from marrying her husband?

Since then, she has insisted on divorce if he continues with me.  As they have seven children, and I have none, the mafsadah in divorcing her was greater than the mafsadah in divorcing me.  And as such, she forced him to divorce me even though I was giving up much of my rights to his time and agreed to her stipulations that their children should not know of the matter.  

2. Is it within the rights of the first wife to force her husband to divorce the second wife .",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    It is not permissible for a woman to ask her husband to 
    divorce his second wife: 

    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be please with 
    him) said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “It is not permissible for a woman to demand her sister’s divorce so 
    that she may take her place and get married; she cannot have more than what 
    is decreed for her.”

    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5144; Muslim, 1413). 

    According to another version, the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade women to stipulate (in the marriage 
    contract) that their sister be divorced. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2577). 
    Al-Bukhaari included this hadeeth in a chapter entitled “Marriage conditions 
    which are not permissible.”

     (a)  Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: the 
    ruling of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    indicates that it is haraam for a woman to stipulate that her sister be 
    divorced, and that the husband is not obliged to fulfil this condition.

    (Zaad al-Ma’aad, 5/107). 

    (b)  Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: The apparent meaning of the 
    phrase “it is not permitted” is that this is forbidden. This is to be 
    understood as being the rule so long as there is no reason to allow that, 
    such as there being some suspicion concerning the woman which implies that 
    she should not remain married to the husband. The woman (the new wife) may 
    suggest that to the husband by way of advice only or so as to avoid harm 
    that either party may cause to the other.

     Ibn Battaal said: Saying that it is not permitted clearly 
    means that it is forbidden, but that does not necessarily mean that the 
    marriage is annulled, rather it is to emphasize that the woman (the new 
    wife) should not demand that he divorce the other wife. She should be 
    content with that which Allaah has decreed for her.

    (al-Fath, 9/274) 

    (c)Al-Nawawi said: the meaning of 
    this hadeeth is that it is not permitted for a non-mahram woman to ask the 
    man to divorce his wife and to marry her so that she becomes the only one on 
    whom he spends, whom treats kindly, has intercourse with, etc, as the 
    divorced woman used to be. 

    Sharh Muslim, 9/193 

    Based on the above, it is not permissible for the first wife 
    to ask her husband to divorce you, so you should not pay any attention to 
    what she says. Note that this is a case of the jealousy that exists in all 
    women; indeed, jealousy existed even in the best of women, namely the wives 
    of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), the Mothers 
    of the Believers. Jealousy is something natural. 

    Secondly: 

    The fact that she had treated you kindly is something for 
    which she will be rewarded, but that does not allow her to ask her husband 
    to divorce you. So be patient and ignore her demand, and treat her kindly as 
    much as you can. The first wife should realize that she will not have 
    anything other than that which is decreed for her, as it says at the end of 
    the hadeeth quoted above from al-Bukhaari.

     Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: 

    Hence he ended by saying, “she cannot have more than what is 
    decreed for her,” to show that even if she asks for that or insists on it 
    and stipulates it as a condition, nothing will happen except that which is 
    decreed by Allaah.

Conditions of polygyny in Islam


Why is polygyny permissible in Islam?


Objections to polygyny in Islam","Praise be to Allah.Allah will not accept any religion other than Islam
Allah concluded His Message to mankind with the religion of Islam, and He tells us that He will not accept any religion other than that. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.” [Aal 'Imran 3:85]
Your backing away from the religion of Islam is considered to be a loss for you, and a loss of the happiness that awaited you, had you entered Islam. You should hasten to enter Islam, and beware of delaying, for that delay may lead to regrettable consequences. 
With regard to what you mention about the reason for your backing off being the idea of plural marriage [polygamy or polygyny], we will present to you the ruling on plural marriage in Islam, and then the wisdom and noble purposes behind it. 
Ruling on polyguny in Islam
The shar’i text which permits plural marriage is: 
Allah says in His Noble Book (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one or (slaves) that your right hands possess. That is nearer to prevent you from doing injustice.” [al-Nisa 4:3]
This is a Quranic text which shows that plural marriage is allowed. According to Islamic shari’ah, a man is permitted to marry one, two, three or four wives , in the sense that he may have this number of wives at one time. 
It is not permissible for him to have more than four. This was stated by the commentators on the Quran and jurists, and there is consensus among the Muslims on this point, with no differing opinions. 
Conditions of polygyny in Islam
It should be noted that there are conditions attached to plural marriage : 

Justice or fairness

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one.” [al-Nisa 4:3] 
This verse indicates that just treatment is a condition for plural marriage to be permitted. 
If a man is afraid that he will not be able to treat his wives justly if he marries more than one, then it is forbidden for him to marry more than one.
What is meant by the justice that is required in order for a man to be permitted to have more than one wife is that he should treat his wives equally in terms of spending, clothing, spending the night with them and other material things that are under his control. 
With regard to justice or fairness in terms of love, he is not held accountable for that, and that is not required of him because he has no control over that. This is what is meant by the verse, 
“You will never be able to do perfect justice between wives even if it is your ardent desire.” [al-Nisa 4:129 – interpretation of the meaning] 

The ability to spend on one’s wives

The evidence for this condition is the verse: 
“And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste, until Allah enriches them of His Bounty.” [al-Nur 24:33 – interpretation of the meaning] 
In this verse, Allah commands those who are able to get married but cannot find the financial means, to remain chaste. One such example is not having enough money to pay the mahr (dowry) and not being able to spend on one’s wife. (al-Mufassal fi Ahkam al-Marah, part 6, p. 286). 
Why is polygyny permissible in Islam?

Plural marriage helps to increase the numbers of the ummah (nation, Muslim community). It is known that the numbers can only be increased through marriage, and the number of offspring gained through plural marriage will be greater than that achieved through marriage to one wife. 

Wise people know that increasing the number of offspring will strengthen the ummah and increase the number of workers in it, which will raise its economic standard – if the leaders run the affairs of the state well and make use of its resources in a proper manner. Ignore the claims of those who say that increasing the numbers of human beings poses a danger to the earth’s resources which are insufficient, for Allah (the Most Wise Who) has prescribed plural marriage has guaranteed to provide provision for His slaves and has created on earth what is more than sufficient for them. 
Whatever shortfall exists is due to the injustice of administrations, governments and individuals, and due to bad management. Look at China, for example, the greatest nation on earth as far as number of inhabitants is concerned, and it is regarded as one of the strongest nations in the world, and other nations would think twice before upsetting China; it is also one of the great industrialized nations. Who would dare think of attacking China, I wonder? And why? 

Statistics show that the number of women is greater than the number of men; if each man were to marry just one woman, this would mean that some women would be left without a husband, which would have a harmful effect on her and on society: 

The harmful effect is that she would never find a husband to take care of her interests, to give her a place to live, to spend on her, to protect her from haram desires, and to give her children to bring her joy. This may lead to deviance and going astray, except for those on whom Allah has mercy. 
With regard to the harmful effects on society, it is well known that this woman who is left without a husband may deviate from the straight path and follow the ways of promiscuity, so she may fall into the swamp of adultery and prostitution – may Allah keep us safe and sound – which leads to the spread of immorality and the emergence of fatal diseases such as AIDS and other contagious diseases for which there is no cure. It also leads to family breakdown and the birth of children whose identity is unknown, and who do not know who their fathers are. 
Those children do not find anyone to show compassion towards them or any mature man to raise them properly. When they go out into the world and find out the truth, that they are illegitimate, that is reflected in their behaviour, and they become exposed to deviance and going astray. They may even bear grudges against society, and who knows? They may become the means of their country’s destruction, leaders of deviant gangs, as is the case in many nations in the world. 

Men are exposed to incidents that may end their lives, for they work in dangerous professions. They are the soldiers who fight in battle, and more men may die than women. This is one of the things that raise the percentage of husbandless women, and the only solution to this problem is plural marriage. 
There are some men who may have strong physical desires, for whom one wife is not enough. If the door is closed to such a man and he is told, you are not allowed more than one wife, this will cause great hardship to him, and his desire may find outlets in forbidden ways. 

In addition to that, a woman menstruates each month, and when she gives birth, she bleeds for forty days (this post-partum bleeding is called nifas in Arabic), at which time a man cannot have intercourse with his wife, because intercourse at the time of menstruation or nifas is forbidden, and the harm that it causes has been proven medically. So plural marriage is permitted when one is able to be fair and just. 

Plural marriage does not exist only in the Islamic religion, rather it was known among the previous nations. Some of the prophets were married to more than one woman. The Prophet of Allah Sulayman (Solomon) had ninety wives. At the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), there were some men who became Muslims who had eight or five wives. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told them to keep four wives and to divorce the rest. 
A wife may be barren, or she may not meet her husband’s needs, or he may be unable to have intercourse with her because she is sick. A husband may long to have children, which is a legitimate desire, and he may want to have a sex life within marriage, which is something permissible, and the only way is to marry another wife. It is only fair for the wife to agree to remain his wife and to allow him to marry another. 
A woman may be one of the man’s relatives and have no one to look after her, and she is unmarried or a widow whose husband has died, and the man may think that the best thing to do for her is to include her in his household as a wife along with his first wife, so that he will both keep her chaste and spend on her. This is better for her than leaving her alone and being content only to spend on her. 
There are other shar’i interests that call for plural marriages, such as strengthening the bonds between families, or strengthening the bonds between a leader and some of his people or group, and he may think that one of the ways of achieving this aim is to become related to them through marriage, even if that is through plural marriage. 

Objections to polygyny in Islam

Some people may object and say that plural marriage means having co-wives in one house, and that the disputes and enmity that may arise between co-wives will have an effect on the husband, children and others, and this is harmful and should be avoided, and the only way to prevent that is to ban plural marriage.  

The response to this objection is that family arguments may occur even when there is only one wife, and they may not even happen when there is more than one wife, as we see in real life. Even if we assume that there may be more arguments than in a marriage to one wife, even if we accept that they may be harmful and bad, the harm is outweighed by the many good things in a plural marriage. Life is not entirely bad or entirely good, but what everyone hopes is that the good will outweigh the bad, and this principle is what applies in the permission for plural marriage.  
Moreover, each wife has the right to her own, separate accommodation as prescribed in Islam. It is not permissible for the husband to force his wives to live together in one house. 

If we allow men to have plural wives, why are women not allowed to have multiple husbands , why does a woman not have the right to marry more than one man? 

The response to this objection is that there is no point in giving a woman the right to marry multiple husbands, rather that is beneath her dignity and she would not know the lineage of her children, because she is the one who bears the offspring, and it is not permissible for the offspring to be formed from the sperm of a number of men lest the lineage of the child be lost and no one will know who is responsible for bringing up the child; this will lead to breakdown of families, loss of ties between fathers and children, which is not permitted in Islam as it is not in the interests of the woman or of the child or of society as a whole.

      This is counted as a gift in return for the favour that 
      your friend did for you, in appreciation for her kindness. It is not 
      ribaa, rather your doing that is part of the Sunnah. It says in a saheeh 
      hadeeth that Ibn ‘Umar said: “The Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and

      give something in return, and if you cannot find anything then make du’aa’

    “Is there any reward for good other than good?”

    [al-Rahmaan 55:60]

    Al-Bukhaari narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) said: “The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) owed a camel of a certain age to a man, who came to ask for it back. 
    The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told his 
    companions to give to him. They looked for a camel of the same age but they 
    could find only a camel which was a year older. The Prophet SAWS (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) told them to give it to him. The man said, 
    ‘You have paid me in full and may Allaah pay you in full.’ The Prophet SAWS 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ‘The best among you is the 
    one who pays his debts in the most handsome manner.’” (al-Istiqraad wa

Ibn Hajar said: the point here is that the 
    Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave the owner of 
    the camel more than he was entitled to. This is an example of the good 
    attitude of the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and 
    his great kindness, humility and fairness.  This is utterly different to the 
    idea of lending money with the condition that it be paid back with interest,

Is it permissible to sleep on your left side?","Praise be to Allah.Sunnah way of sleeping
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to sleep on his right side, putting his right hand on his right cheek, and this is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recommended others to do. 
According to an authentic hadith narrated from al-Bara ibn ‘Azib, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When you go to bed, do wudu as if for prayer, then lie down on your right side…” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, al-Wudu, 239) 
The Sunnah is to put one’s right hand under one’s cheek. Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) said, “When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went to bed at night, he would put his hand under his cheek, then say, ‘Allahumma bismika amutu wa ahya (O Allah, in Your name I die and I live).’ Then when he woke up he would say, ‘Al-hamdu Lillah alladhi ahyana ba’da ma amatana wa ilayhi al-nushur (Praise be to Allah who has brought us back to life after causing us to die, and to Him is the resurrection).’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6314)
Ibn Hajar said: “The right side is singled out for a number of reasons, such as: this lets a person wake up more quickly; it also allows the heart to lean towards the right hand side. Ibn al-Jawzi said: the doctors have stated that this position is more beneficial to the body. They said to start by lying on the right for a while, then turn over to the left, because the former aids peristalsis and sleeping on one’s left side facilitates digestion.”
Al-Nawawi said: “This hadith mentions three acts that are Sunnah, the first of which is doing wudu before going to sleep. If one already has wudu, there is no need to repeat it , because the aim is to go to sleep in a state of purity. The second is to sleep on one’s right side…”
Is it permissible to sleep on your left side?
This indicates that sleeping on one’s right side is Sunnah, and if a person does that to follow the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), he will be rewarded for that. Sleeping on one’s left side is permitted, but one misses out on the reward for following the Sunnah.

Rewards for relatives and descendants of the hafiz","Praise be to Allah.Benefits of memorizing the Quran 
Memorizing the Quran is an act of worship through which one seeks the Face of Allah and reward in the Hereafter. Without this intention, he will never have any reward , rather he will be punished for doing this act of worship for someone or something other than Allah. 
The hafiz (the person who has memorized the Quran) should not have any intention of gaining worldly benefits by memorizing the Quran , because his memorization thereof is not a product to be traded with in this world, rather it is an act of worship which is done for the sake of his Lord.
Benefits of being a Hafiz in this world 
Allah has given special privileges to the one who memorizes the Quran in a number of ways in this world and in the Hereafter, for example:

He takes precedence over others in leading the prayer.

 It was narrated that Abu Mas’ud al-Ansari said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The people should be led in prayer by the one among them who has the most knowledge of the Book of Allah; if they are equal in knowledge of the Quran, then by the one who has most knowledge of the Sunnah; if they are equal in knowledge of the Sunnah, then by the one who migrated (made hijrah) first; if they are equal in terms of hijrah, then by the one who became Muslim first. No man should lead another in prayer in his domain of authority, or sit in his place in his house, except with his permission.” (Narrated by Muslim, 673) 
`Abd-Allah ibn `Umar said: “When the first Muhaajirun (emigrants) came to Quba, before the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came (to Madinah), Salim the freed slave of Abu Hudhayfah used to lead them in prayer, and he was the one who knew the most Quran.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 660)

He is placed in front of others in a common grave, closer to the qiblah, if it is essential to bury him with others.

Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: “The Prophet would wrap two of the men slain at Uhud in a single cloth, then he would ask, ‘Which of them knew more Quran?’ If one of them was pointed out to him, he would put that one in the lahd (niche in the side of the grave) first. And he said, ‘I will be a witness over these people on the Day of Resurrection.’ He commanded that they should be buried with their blood, without being washed, and that no funeral prayer should be offered for them.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1278)

He takes precedence in leadership if he is able to bear that.

‘Amir ibn Wathilah narrated that Nafi’ ibn ‘Abd al-Harith met ‘Umar in ‘Usfan, and ‘Umar had appointed him as governor of Makkah. ‘Umar said, “Who have you appointed in charge of the people of the valley?” He said, “Ibn Abza.” ‘Umar asked, “Who is Ibn Abza?” He said, “One of our freed slaves.” Umar said, “Have you appointed over them a freed slave?!” He said, “He is well-versed in the Book of Allah and he has knowledge of the laws of inheritance.” ‘Umar said: “Your Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Indeed, by this Book, Allah would exalt some people and degrade others.’” (Narrated by Muslim, 817)
 Benefits of being a Hafiz in the Hereafter

The status of the one who memorizes the Quran will be commensurate with the last verse he memorized. 

‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It will be said to the companion of the Quran (i.e., the one who memorized and studied it): ‘Read, advance in status and recite as you used to do in the world, for your status will be commensurate with the last verse that you recite.’” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2914; he said this is a sahih hasan hadith. Al-Albani said in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, no. 2329, it is hasan sahih. Also narrated by Abu Dawud, 1464)
 What is meant by reciting here is memorizing.

He will be with the angels, accompanying them. 

`Aishah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who recites the Quran and learns it by heart, will be with the noble righteous scribes (in Heaven) and the one who exerts himself to learn the Quran by heart and recites it with great difficulty, will have a double reward.”  (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4653; Muslim, 798) 

He will be given a crown of honour and a garment of honour to wear. 

Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Quran will come on the Day of Resurrection and will say, ‘O Lord, adorn him.’ So he will be given a crown of honour to wear. Then it will say, ‘O Lord, give him more.’ So he will be given a garment of honour.’ Then it will say, ‘O Lord, be pleased with him.’ So Allah will be pleased with him. Then it will be said to him, ‘Recite and advance in status, and for each verse you will gain one more hasanah (reward for good deed).” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2915. He said, this is a sahih hasan hadith. Al-Albani said in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 2328, this is hasan)

The Quran will intercede for him with his Lord. 

Abu Umamah al-Bahili said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, ‘Recite the Quran, for it will come on the Day of Resurrection to intercede for its companions . Recite the two bright ones, al-Baqarah and Surah Al ‘Imran, for they will come on the Day of Resurrection like two clouds or two shades or two flocks of birds in ranks, pleading for those who recite them. Recite Surah al-Baqarah for to take recourse to it is a blessing and to give it up is a cause of grief, and the magicians cannot confront it.”  (Narrated by Muslim, 804, and by al-Bukhari in a mu’allaq report)
Rewards for relatives and descendants of the hafiz
With regard to his relatives and descendants, there is evidence concerning his parents that they will be clothed with garments which far surpass everything to be found in this world, and that will only be because they took care of and taught their child. Even if they themselves were ignorant, Allah will honour them because of their child. But the one who prevented his child from learning the Quran, he will be one of those who are deprived. 
Abu Hurayrah said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The Quran will come on the Day of Resurrection like a pale man saying to its companion, “Do you recognize me? I am the one who made you stay up at night and made you thirsty during the day…” Then he will be given dominion in his right hand and eternity in his left, and a crown of dignity will be placed upon his head, and his parents will be clothed with garments which far surpass everything to be found in this world. They will say, “O Lord, how did we earn this.” It will be said to them, “Because you taught your child the Quran.”’” (Narrated by al-Tabarani in al-Awsat, 6/51)
Buraydah said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever reads the Quran, learns it and acts in accordance with it, on the Day of Resurrection his parents will be given a crown to wear whose light will be like the light of the sun, and his parents will be given garments which far surpass everything to be found in this world. They will say, “Why have we been given this to wear?” It will be said, “Because your child learned the Quran.”’” (Narrated by al-Hakim, 1/756)

But if he divorces his wife with the third talaaq, then she becomes haraam to her first husband until she has married a second husband in a genuine marriage which is consummated. The Quranic evidence for that is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The divorce is twice, after that, either you retain her on reasonable terms or release her with kindness…
And if he has divorced her (the third time), then she is not lawful unto him thereafter until she has married another husband” [al-Baqarah 2:229-230]
 The last divorce refers to the third divorce, according to all the scholars. 
The evidence from the Sunnah is the hadeeth narrated by ‘Urwah ibn al-Zubayr, according to which ‘Aa’ishah told him that the wife of Rifaa’ah al-Qurazi came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of Allah, Rifaa’ah divorced me thrice, then I was married to ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn al-Zubayr al-Qurazi, but he has nothing with him except something like this fringe. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Perhaps you want to go back to Rifaa’ah? No, (it is not possible), unless and until you enjoy the sexual relation with him (‘Abd al-Rahmaan), and he enjoys the sexual relation with you.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4856; Muslim, 2587) 
The phrase “divorced me three times” means that this was the divorce which meant that she was no longer married to him, which is the third talaaq. The Prophet’s words “until you enjoy the sexual relation with him (‘Abd al-Rahmaan), and he enjoys the sexual relation with you” refer to intercourse. 
Al-Nawawi said: “This hadeeth indicates that the woman who has been divorced by a third talaaq is not permissible to the man who has divorced her until she has been married by another husband, who has intercourse with her then separates from her, and she completes her ‘iddah. Merely drawing up the marriage contract with her does not make her permissible to the first husband. This is the view of all the scholars among the Sahaabah, Taabi’een and those who came after them.  Sharh Muslim, 10/3

We advise you to read it. Here is the link:
Weakness of Faith
There follow two pieces of advice from major scholars, in addition to the above, summing up what is required on your part: 
1 – We advise you to read Quran a great deal, listen to its recitation and ponder the meanings of what you read and listen to, as much as you can. If you find anything difficult to understand then ask the scholars in your country or write to other Sunni scholars for advice. 
We also advise you to remember Allah a great deal (dhikr) with the dhikrs narrated in the saheeh ahaadeeth, such as “Laa ilaaha ill-Allah (there is no god except Allah)”, “Subhaan-Allah wa’l-hamdu Lillaah wa laa ilaaha ill-Allah wa Allahu akbar (Glory be to Allah, praise be to Allah, there is no god except Allah and Allah is Most Great)”, and so on. For more information on this see al-Kalim al-Tayyib by Ibn Taymiyah; al-Waabil al-Sayyib by Ibn al-Qayyim; Riyaadh al-Saaliheen [available in English]; al-Adhkaar al-Nawawiyyah by Imaam al-Nawawi, and so on. 
Remembering Allah (dhikr) increases faith and brings peace of mind. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest” [al-Ra’d 13:28]
Regularly perform acts of worship such as prayer, fasting and the other pillars of Islam, whilst hoping for the mercy of Allah and putting your trust in Him in all your affairs. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The believers are only those who, when Allah is mentioned, feel a fear in their hearts and when His Verses (this Quran) are recited unto them, they (i.e. the Verses) increase their Faith; and they put their trust in their Lord (Alone);
Who perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat‑as‑ Salaah) and spend out of that We have provided them.
It is they who are the believers in truth. For them are grades of dignity with their Lord, and forgiveness and a generous provision (Paradise).” [al-Anfaal 8:2]

2 – Faith is also increased by obeying Allah, and it decreases when one disobeys Him. So adhere to doing that which Allah has enjoined such as performing the prayers on time in congregation in the mosque, praying zakaah willingly to purify yourself of sin and show compassion towards the poor and needy, sitting with good and righteous people so that they will help you to apply sharee’ah and guide you to that which will bring you happiness in this world and in the Hereafter.
 Avoid the followers of bid’ah and sinners, lest they tempt you and weaken your resolve to do good.
 Do a lot of voluntary good actions, turn to Allah, and ask Him for strength.
 If you do that, Allah will increase you in faith and you will make up for lost time, and Allah will increase you in goodness and steadfastness in adhering to Islam.

    It does not seem that those who commit crimes have the same 
    type of blood, so there is no connection between blood type and human 
    behaviour. All kinds of people – good and bad – share blood types.

     What we advise this prisoner to do is to repent to Allaah 
    from whatever crime he has committed, and to restore people’s rights if he 
    has wronged anyone, and to make the most of his life before he dies and of 
    his good health before he falls sick, and  to hasten to repent to Allaah. 
    For Allaah will accept the repentance of His slave when he repents, and will 
    forgive him his sins.

     There is nothing wrong with giving a blood sample to the 
    state from the point of view of sharee’ah, so long as it will not be put to 
    a bad use and rather it will be used for prisoner records. But the prison 
    administration should be notified that the reason for criminality is not 
    blood type, rather it is corruption of the heart and mind, and growing up 
    with crime and continuing in it.

     If they want to deal with it, then they should tackle the 
    root of the problem by looking for the motives to commit crime and the 
    reasons why it develops, then try to put a stop to it and to reform the 
    criminals. There is nothing better than Islam for dealing with that.

But the wife should tell him of her situation and let him know that she is bleeding in menstruation, because a man may not realize that and he may have intercourse with her whilst she is menstruating, which is haraam according to sharee’ah. In that case the sin is on her. Menstrual blood is something that is well known to women, and when it starts the woman is considered to be menstruating.

14046,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14046,When should a person who is observing i’tikaaf during the last ten days of Ramadan enter i’tikaaf and exit from it?,I want to observe i’tikaaf during the last ten days of Ramadan. I would like to know when I should enter the mosque and when I should exit therefrom.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
With regard to entering the place of i’tikaaf, the majority of scholars (including the four imams Abu Haneefah, Maalik, al-Shaafa’i and Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on them) are of the view that the one who wants to observe i’tikaaf during the last ten days of Ramadan should enter his place of i'tikaaf before the sun sets on the night of the twenty-first. They quoted several texts as evidence, including the following: 
1 – It was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to observe i'tikaaf during the last ten nights of Ramadan, Agreed upon. This indicates that the period of i’tikaaf is counted by the nights, not the days. And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And by the ten nights” [al-Fajr 89:2]
The last ten nights start with the twenty-first. 
Based on this, he should enter the mosque before the sun sets on the night of the twenty-first. 
2 – They (the scholars) said that one of the greatest aims of i'tikaaf is to seek Laylat al-Qadr, and the night of the twenty-first is one of the odd-numbered nights in the last ten nights of Ramadan, so it may possibly be Laylat al-Qadr, so he should be observing i’tikaaf on that night. This was stated by al-Sindi in Haashiyat al-Nasaa’i. 
See al-Mughni, 4/489. 
But al-Bukhari (2041) and Muslim (1173) narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wanted to observe i’tikaaf, he would pray Fajr then enter his place of i'tikaaf. 
Because of the apparent meaning of this hadeeth, some of the salaf were of the view that he would enter his place of i’tikaaf after Fajr prayer. This view was followed by the scholars of the Standing Committee (10/114) and Shaykh Ibn Baz (15/442). 
But the majority of scholars responded to this hadeeth in one of two ways: 
(1)That the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had started i'tikaaf before the sun set, but he did not enter the place for i’tikaaf until after Fajr prayer
Al-Nawawi said: “When he wanted to observe i’tikaaf, he would pray Fajr then enter his place of i'tikaaf”  - this was quoted as evidence by those who say that i’tikaaf should be started at the beginning of the day. This is the view of al-Awzaa’i and al-Thawri, and of al-Layth in one of his two opinions. Maalik, Abu Haneefah, al-Shaafa’i and Ahmad said: he should enter (i’tikaaf) before the sun sets if he wants to observe i’tikaaf for a month or for ten days. They interpreted the hadeeth as meaning that he entered the place of i’tikaaf in order to be alone there after he prayed Fajr, not that this is the time when he began i’tikaaf; rather he was in i’tikaaf from before Maghrib and stayed in the mosque, and when he had prayed Fajr he withdrew to be by himself. 
(2)al-Qaadi Abu Ya’la, one of the Hanbalis, responded by interpreting the hadeeth as meaning that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do that on the twentieth. Al-Sindi said: This response is more likely to be correct.
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked in Fataawa al-Siyaam (p. 501): When does i’tikaaf begin? 
He replied: 
The majority of scholars are of the view that i’tikaaf should begin on the night of the twenty first, not from Fajr of the twenty-first, although some of the scholars are of the view that i’tikaaf should begin from Fajr of the twenty-first, based on the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that was narrated by al-Bukhari: “When he had prayed Fajr he entered his place of i'tikaaf”. But the majority of scholars responded by stating that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) withdrew from people in the morning, but the intention to observe i’tikaaf was formed at the beginning of the night, because the last ten nights start when the sun sets on the twentieth.  
He also said (p. 503): 
Entering the place of i’tikaaf for the last ten nights of Ramadan may be done when the sun sets on the night of the twenty-first, because that is the time when the last ten nights begin. This is not contradicted by the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah because the wording is different, so it should be understood according to what the language indicates. This is what was narrated by al-Bukhari (2041) from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) observed i’tikaaf every Ramadan and when he had prayed Fajr he would enter the place where he observed i’tikaaf. 
Her words “and when he had prayed Fajr he would enter the place where he observed i’tikaaf” indicate that he was already staying in the mosque, meaning that he was in the mosque before he entered he place of i’tikaaf. 
Secondly: 
With regard to coming out of i’tikaaf: 
He should come out when the sun sets on the last day of Ramadan. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked: When should a person come out of i’tikaaf? Is it after the sun sets on the night of Eid or after Fajr on the day of Eid? 
He replied: 
He should come out of i’tikaaf when Ramadan ends. Ramadan ends when the sun sets on the night of Eid. Fataawa al-Siyaam, p. 502. 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 10/441. 
The period of i’tikaaf during the (last) ten nights of Ramadan ends when the sun sets on the last day of the month. 
If he chooses to stay until he has prayed Fajr and then depart from his place of i’tikaaf to the Eid prayer, there is nothing wrong with that. Some of the scholars regarded that as mustahabb. 
Imam Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) said that he saw that some of the scholars who had observed i’tikaaf during the last ten nights of Ramadan did not go back to their families until they had attended the (prayer of Eid) al-Fitr with the people. Maalik said: I heard that from the righteous people who have passed on, and this is the dearest to me of what I have heard about that. 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (6/323): 
Al-Shaafa’i and his companions said: Whoever would like to follow the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in observing i’tikaaf during the last ten nights of Ramadan should enter the mosque before the sun sets on the night of the twenty-first, so that he will not miss any of it, and he should come out after the sun sets on the night of Eid, whether the month is twenty-nine days or thirty. It is better for him to stay in the mosque on the night of Eid so that he can offer the Eid prayer there, or go out to the Eid prayer-place if they pray Eid there. 
If he goes directly from i’tikaaf to the Eid prayer, it is mustahabb for him to do ghusl and make himself look good before going out, because this is one of the Sunnahs of Eid. For more information please see question no. 36442.",Islam Q&A
14051,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14051,Shaving Head in Islam,Is t sunnah to shave the head?,,,"Praise be to Allah.What may be understood from the words of the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) is that shaving the head is of six kinds: 
1 – An act of worship and a means of drawing closer to Allah, for which a person will be rewarded. This applies in four cases only, to which there is no fifth: 
(i)Hajj
(ii)‘Umrah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Indeed Allah shall fulfil the true vision which He showed to His Messenger [i.e. the Prophet saw a dream that he has entered Makkah along with his Companions, having their (head) hair shaved and cut short] in very truth. Certainly, you shall enter Al-Masjid Al-Haraam, if Allah wills,  secure, (some) having your heads shaved, and (some) having your head hair cut short” [al-Fath 48:27]
(iii)Shaving the child’s head on the seventh day after birth. The evidence for that is the hadeeth narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1439) from ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) offered a sheep as ‘aqeeqah for al-Hasan, and said: ‘O Faatimah, shave his head and give the weight of his hair in silver in charity.’” (Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 1226. See also Tuhfat al-Mawlood by Ibn al-Qayyim, p. 217).
(iv)The kaafir when he becomes a Muslim, because of the report narrated by Abu Dawood (356) which says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded a kaafir man who had become Muslim, “Shave off the hair of kufr and get circumcised.” (Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood; see also al-Mughni, 1/276; Sharh al-‘Umdah by Shaykh al-Islam, 1/350)
The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) were agreed that it is not recommended to shave the head at times other than these four. See al-Istiqaamah by Shaykh al-Islam, 1/256. 
2 – Shirk (the association of others with Allah). Shaving the head may be a form of shirk, when the head is shaved as an act of humbling oneself  before someone other than Allah. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Zaad al-Ma’aad (4/195): “Such as when the mureeds (disciples of Sufi shaykhs) shave their heads for their shaykhs, and one of them says, ‘I shaved my head for So and so.’ This is like saying, ‘I prostrated to So and so,’ because shaving the head is an act of humility and submission, which is why it is one of the acts that complete the Hajj, for it means putting one’s forelock in the hand of its Lord, in submission to His greatness and humbling oneself before His glory. It is one of the most eloquent forms of submission. Hence when the Arabs wanted to humiliate their prisoners and free them, they would shave their heads and let them go…” 
3 – A reprehensible innovation (bid’ah) – this takes many forms, such as: 
Shaving the head as an act of worship and religious devotion – other than in the four cases mentioned above – such as making a shaved  head a sign of righteousness or complete asceticism (zuhd). This is what the Khawaarij used to do. Hence it was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) described the Khawaarij as “their sign will be that they shave their heads.” (al-Bukhaari, 7007; Muslim, 1763). Al-Qurtubi said: “ ‘Their sign will be that they shave their heads’ means that they will make that a symbol of their rejection of worldly adornments and a sign by which they might be known. This is ignorance on their part… and introducing something into the religion of Allah which differs from that which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the Rightly-guided Khaleefahs and their followers used to do.” (See Sharh al-‘Umdah, 1/231; Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 21/118). 
Another example is that which some people do, ordering a person who has repented to shave his head. This is a bid’ah (innovation) which was not done by any of the Sahaabah or those who followed them in truth, or by any of the imams of the Muslims. (Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 21/118) 
4 – Haraam kinds of shaving the head, which takes a number of forms, such as: 
(i)Shaving the head when calamity strikes, such as the death of a relative and the like. It was narrated that Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) disowned the woman who raises her voice in lament, the one who shaves her hair at times of calamity and the one who rends her garment.” Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned in al-Zawaajir ‘an Iqtiraaf al-Kabaa’ir the 117th major sin: shaving the head at times of calamity. He said: “Because that is showing discontent and a lack of acceptance of the divine decree.”
(ii)Shaving the head in a manner that resembles the kuffaar or immoral people who are well known for shaving their heads. A person might do that as a kind of adornment, to make himself look like them, or he might shave the hair at the sides of the head and leave the middle long. All of these are haraam forms of imitating others, and a form of promiscuity and decadence – we ask Allah to keep us safe and sound. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4031; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 3401). Al-Faari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: i.e., whoever makes himself resemble the kuffaar or immoral people, then he is one of them, i.e., he shares the sin with them.
5 – Permissible – i.e., shaving the head for a reason, such as shaving it as a remedy for disease, or to prevent lice and so on. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This is permissible according to the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and scholarly consensus. (Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 12/117) 
6 – Shaving the head for none of the reasons stated above. 
This is a matter concerning which the scholars differed. Some of them regarded it as makrooh, such as Maalik (may Allah have mercy on him), and they quoted as evidence the fact that it is the sign of the followers of innovation, namely the Khawaarij, as stated in the hadeeth quoted above. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” 
Those who regard it as permissible quoted as evidence the report narrated by Abu Dawood (4192) who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to the family of Ja’far ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) three days after Ja’far had died, and called for a barber and told him to shave the heads of his sons. (Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 3532). 
And Abu Dawood narrated (4195) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw a child who had part of his head shaved and not other parts. He said: “Shave it all or leave it all.” (Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 3535). Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “This clearly shows that it is permissible to shave the head, and it cannot be interpreted in any other way.” (Sharh Muslim). But using these two hadeeth to show that it is permissible to shave the head for no reason is a matter which is subject to further discussion. 
Firstly, shaving the head here is for a reason, so it is permissible, the reason being that boys are more likely than others to be affected by lice, because they sweat a lot and get dirty. Zaad al-Ma’aad, 4/159. 
Secondly, this has to do with a young boy, and concessions are made for children that are not made for adults. Haashiyat al-Sindi ‘ala al-Nasaa’i. See also Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 21/119; Sharh al-‘Umdah, 1/230. 
There is some difference of opinion concerning the fifth type: is shaving the head makrooh or permissible? It is preferable not to shave it. Al-Faawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is better not to shave it unless that is for Hajj or ‘Umrah, as was the practice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions (may Allah be pleased with them). (From ‘Awn al-Ma’bood, 11/248).

14052,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14052,He wants to see the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in a dream,What is the best way to see Prophet Muhammad in a dream??.,,,"Praise be to Allah.There is no way prescribed in sharee’ah for the one who wants to see the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in a dream. It is appropriate here to comment on a number of matters that have to do with this question: 
1 – The one who sees the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in a dream has to see him in his true form, at any stage of his life. So if a person claims to have seen light or a man with a completely white beard or a man wearing pants for example, these are not attributes of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so this is not the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Shaytaan cannot appear in the true image of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but he can appear in other forms. 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, “Whoever sees me in a dream will see me when he is awake, and the Shaytaan cannot take my shape.” Al-Bukhaari said: Ibn Sireen said: If he sees him in his true image. 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6592; Muslim, 2266 
If a man told Ibn Sireen that he had seen the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) [in a dream], he would say, “Describe to me the one whom you saw.” If he gave a description that he did not recognize, he would say, “You did not see him.” Its isnaad is saheeh. 
Al-Haakim narrated via ‘Aasim ibn Kulayb (who said), my father told me: I said to Ibn ‘Abbaas, “I saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in a dream.” He said, “Describe him to me.” He said, “I mentioned al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali and said that he looked like him.” He said, “You did indeed see him.” Its isnaad is jayyid. 
See Fath al-Baari, 12/383, 384. 
2 – The Muslim should not concern himself with dreams and visions, basing his affairs on them and forgetting about the state of wakefulness in which Allaah has enjoined rulings and acts of worship on him. 
3 – The Muslim who is following the Sunnah sees the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in his heart; the more he follows him the more he will see him. So when he goes out of his house or goes to the mosque or does wudoo’, he remembers what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do. When he prays or performs Hajj he follows his Sunnah. When he buys and sells or interacts with people, he acts according to the teachings of his Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). When he is at home with his family and children he follows the teachings of his Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
This is what the Muslim should seek and strive to achieve.

 Al-Nawawi said: The right hand is not to be used for any of those things for cleaning oneself after relieving oneself (i.e., either urinating or defecating). 
On this basis, one has to use the left hand for removing najaasah (impurity), no matter how it is used, whether one uses the entire hand or part of it. The aim is to remove the najaasah from the body. The issue here is flexible; what matters is to avoid using the right hand in removing dirt. And Allah knows best.

Shari`ah is what distinguishes between actions that will bring benefit and actions that will cause harm. This is Allah’s justice towards His creation, and His light which shines for His slaves. People cannot live without laws (Shari`ah ) to help them distinguish between what they should and should not do. 
Because man has a will, he has to know what he wants, is it beneficial or harmful? Is it good for him or bad for him?  
Some of these things may be known instinctively, some of it may be known by working it out in a rational manner, and some of it may only be known from the teachings and guidance of the messengers. (See al-Tadmuriyyah by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, p. 213, 214; Miftah Dar al-Sa’adah, vol. 2, p. 383) 
No matter how impressive and attractive the atheist, materialist schools of thought may be, and no matter how many ideas and theories there may be, individuals and societies can never do without the true religion , they can never answer the needs of body and soul. The further the individual sinks into those ways, the more certain it becomes that he cannot find security or quench his thirst, and that there is no way out except through the true religion .
Ernest Renan says: 
“It is possible that everything we love could disappear and that rational thinking, science and industry could cease to exist, but it is impossible that religion could be eliminated. Rather it will remain as proof that materialistic thought which wants to restrict man to the narrow path of the base life of this world is false.” (See al-Din by ‘Abd-Allah Darraz, p. 87) 
Muhammad Farid Wajdi says: 
“It is impossible that the idea of religion could diminish, because it is the most refined inclination of the soul and its noblest emotion, in addition to being the inclination that ennobles man. Rather this inclination will increase and the religious nature of man will remain so long as he retains that reason which enables him to distinguish between beauty and ugliness. This instinct will increase according to his level of rationality.” (Al-Din by ‘Abd-Allah Darraz, p. 87)  
If man is far away from his Lord, then according to his level of knowledge and understanding he will realize the extent of his ignorance of his Lord and His attributes, and his ignorance of his own self and what is good for him or bad for him, what leads to bliss and what leads to doom, and his ignorance of such basic matters as astronomy, mathematics and the like.  At this point the wise man will move from the state of arrogance and pride to humility and submission, and will realize that behind all this knowledge is the All-Knowing, All-Wise, and that behind nature there is an Almighty Creator. This truth compels the objective seeker to believe in the unseen and acknowledge the true religion, and to respond to the call of human nature and innate instinct. If a person fails to do that he is going against his innate nature and sinking to the level of the dumb animals.  
Thus we may conclude that following the true religion – that which is based on belief in Allah Alone (Tawhid) and worshipping Him in the way that He has prescribed – is an essential element of life if man is to be a true slave to the Lord of the Worlds, and to attain happiness and be free of tiredness and exhaustion in this world and in the Hereafter. It is essential in order to perfect man’s rational thinking. In this way alone can reason fulfil its desires; without it man cannot fulfil his higher ambitions. 
It is an essential element for purifying the soul and disciplining the emotions, for in religion the noble emotions find fertile ground and an inexhaustible spring to help them achieve their goals. 
It is an essential element for strengthening willpower and supplying it with the greatest motives and power to resist the factor of helplessness and despair. 
How to attain full knowledge
On this basis, if there is anyone who says that man is sociable in nature, we must say that man is religious by nature. (See al-Din by ‘Abd-Allah Darraz, 84, 98), because man has two strengths, knowledge and willpower, and his ultimate happiness depends on him acquiring both. Full knowledge can only be attained by knowing the following: 

Knowing Allah, the Creator and Provider Who created man from nothing and bestowed blessings upon him.
Knowing the names and attributes of Allah, and the effect of these names upon His slaves.
Knowing the way to reach Him.
Knowing the obstacles that prevent man from knowing this way and the great blessings to which it leads.
Knowing yourself in a true sense, and knowing what your soul needs, what is good for it and what is bad for it, and knowing its faults and shortcomings.

These five matters will complete a person’s knowledge. 
Achieving perfect will power can only be achieved by paying attention to the rights of Allah over His slaves and fulfilling them sincerely, adhering to that and bearing witness to the blessings of Allah. These two strengths can only be perfected with the help of Allah, so man needs Allah to guide him to the Straight Path to which He guides His close friends. (See al-Fawaid, p, 18-19) 
Religion is a protective shield for society
Once we know that the true religion is the divine support that directs the potentials of man, then we know that religion is also a protective shield for society, because human life can only be strong when there is cooperation among the members of society. 
This cooperation can only be achieved by means of a system that regulates the relationships between them, defines their duties and protects their rights. 
This system needs a deterrent that will deter one from transgressing and encourage one to follow the system, one that carries weight in people’s hearts and prevents them from overstepping its limits. 
What is this authority? I say that there is no power on earth that can match the power of religion in protecting the sanctity of the system, guaranteeing the coherence of society and the stability of its system, and providing the means of peace and security. 
The reason for that is that man differs from all other living beings in that his voluntary actions and dealings are governed by something that can be neither seen nor heard, namely the religious belief that disciplines the heart and guides his faculties. Man is inevitably led by his belief, whether it is sound or corrupt. If his belief is sound, everything else will also be sound, but if it is corrupt then everything else will also be corrupt. 
Belief and faith regulate man
Belief and faith are the two things that regulate man and – as we can see in most cases – they are of two types: 

Belief in the importance of virtue and human dignity, and other abstract values which make noble souls feel ashamed to go against their principles even if they are spared the consequences of physical punishment.
Belief in Allah and that He is always watching and knows what is in our hearts, and that He knows secrets and that which is more hidden. The authority of SharI`ah is based on its commands and prohibitions, and makes a person feel shy before Allah, either out of love for Him, or out of fear of Him, or both. Undoubtedly this type of faith is the stronger of the two and carries more weight in human hearts. It is more able to resist the storms of desire and the upheavals of emotion, and it has more effect on the hearts of the masses and the elite.

For this reason, religion is the best guarantee for ensuring that people will deal with one another on a basis of fairness and justice, and hence it is a social necessity. It comes as no surprise that the relationship of religion to the ummah is like that of the heart to the body. Nowadays we see that there are many religions in the world, and each people has its religion which they cling to. What is the true religion which will fulfil the aspirations of the human soul? What are the guidelines of the true religion? 
And Allah knows best.","From Kitab al-Islam Usooluhu wa Mabaadi’uhu, by Dr. Muhammad ibn ‘Abd-Allah ibn Salih al-Suhaym"
14061,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14061,It is not permissible to say that rule belongs to the people or that wealth is the wealth of the people,What is the ruling on saying that rule belongs to the people or that wealth belongs to the people?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.These words are a 
    fabrication and those who fabricated them are liars in their claim. They do 
    not implement that themselves by surrendering their opinion to the opinion 
    of the people, not even in a single case. This is a deceitful slogan aimed 
    at cheating the people who seek relief from one oppressive regime, only to 
    be cheated by a second oppressive regime.  

    In fact, people should be protected and respected; they 
    should enjoy justice and sanctity in every sense of the word. They should 
    not be driven like cattle. But it is not permissible to accept these slogans 
    as is. Rule belongs to Allaah and the masses must be directed in the light 
    of His Revelation and ruled according to sharee’ah. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Do they then seek the judgement of (the days of) 
    Ignorance? And who is better in judgement than Allaah for a people who have 
    firm Faith”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:50] 

    “The decision [hukm] is only for Allaah”

    [al-An’aam 6:57]

    We should not say, “the rule is for the people,” because 
    those who lead the people according to their own whims and desires are those 
    with materialistic ideologies or idolatrous principles that go against what 
    Allaah has revealed, and impose their own authority by force under these 
    devious, fabricated slogans. 

    Similarly, the “wealth of Allaah” must be spent on the 
    general interests of the Muslims, to protect the Muslim borders and defend 
    Muslim causes in the east and in the west, above all; to call people to 
    Allaah; to strive to defeat the oppressors and those who transgress against 
    some of the Muslims; and to meet the needs of those who are in need, as 
    mentioned in Soorat al-Hashr where Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning):  

    “(And there is also a share in this booty) for the poor 
    emigrants, who were expelled from their homes and their property, seeking 
    Bounties from Allaah and to please Him, and helping Allaah (i.e. helping His 
    religion — Islamic Monotheism) and His Messenger (Muhammad). Such are indeed 
    the truthful (to what they say).

    9. And (it is also for) those who, before them, had homes 
    (in Al‑Madeenah) and had adopted the Faith, love those who emigrate to them, 
    and have no jealousy in their breasts for that which they have been given 
    (from the booty of Banu An‑Nadeer), and give them (emigrants) preference 
    over themselves even though they were in need of that. And whosoever is 
    saved from his own covetousness, such are they who will be the successful.

    10. And those who came after them say: ‘Our Lord! Forgive 
    us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith, and put not in our hearts 
    any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed full of 
    kindness, Most Merciful’”

    [al-Hashr 59:8-10]

    Priority must be given to spending it on areas where need is 
    greatest. This is what should be done with the wealth of Allaah. It is not 
    permissible for selfish people to take it for themselves, or to spend it on 
    extravagance and immorality, let alone spending it on corrupt and evil 
    things. 

    It is not permissible at all to call it “the wealth of the 
    people” because if we accept this, then they will justify doing that, and 
    they will squander a large part of it on preserving their own hold on power, 
    spying and buying people off. Moreover, people vary in how strong or weak 
    they are, how rich or poor, how ignorant or righteous, how resilient or 
    otherwise. So how can wealth belong to one who has no need of it because he 
    is wealthy, powerful, knowledgeable or skilled, or to one who should be 
    deprived of it because of his corruption and evil?  

    Allaah the Almighty spoke the truth when He said 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “So after the truth, what else can there be, save error?”

    [Yoonus 10:32]
But these liars hope to 
    overthrow rule by sharee’ah. 

    See: al-Ajwabah al-Mufeedah li Muhimmaat al-‘Aqeedah, 
    p. 55-56. 
By Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan 
    al-Doosari (may Allaah have mercy on him). 

    It is not permissible to say that wealth is the wealth of the 
    people, because that means that the people have the right to dispose of it 
    however they wish. 

    But in fact, wealth is the wealth of Allaah, and all people 
    must spend it in the ways enjoined by Allaah and His Messenger  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 

    In Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (10/281), Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn 
    Taymiyah] said, commenting on the hadeeth of the Messenger  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him): “All of the wealth which is at the 
    disposal of the ruler is the wealth of Allaah and His Messenger, meaning 
    that Allaah commanded His Messenger to spend that wealth in ways of 
    obedience to Him, so it is essential to obey him in distributing this wealth 
    as it is essential to obey him in all that he commands, for whoever obeys 
    the Messenger has obeyed Allaah, and he has conveyed this from Allaah.” 

    He said, concerning the wealth which the troops take from the 
    bayt al-maal (treasury) (25/26):

     Moreover, these troops are the troops of Allaah who are 
    fighting for the sake of Allaah, as His slaves. They take these provisions 
    from the bayt al-maal to help them in jihad. What they take is not the 
    property of the ruler, rather it is the property of Allaah which the ruler 
    distributes to those who are entitled to it. 

    And he said (28/268): 

    The rulers do not have the right to distribute it (the wealth 
    of the bayt al-maal) according to their own whims and desires, as an owner 
    may distribute his own wealth. Rather they are trustees, deputies and 
    agents; they are not owners. As the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “By Allaah, I do not give to anyone 
    or withhold from anyone (according to my own personal opinion), rather I am 
    a distributor who allocates things as I am commanded.” Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari. 

    This is the Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds who told us 
    that he did not give or withhold on the basis of his own will and choice, as 
    an owner does who is permitted to dispose of his wealth as he wishes, or as 
    kings do who give to those whom they like and withhold from those whom they 
    do not like. Rather he is a slave of Allaah who distributes wealth as he is 
    commanded by Allaah.",Islam Q&A
14065,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14065,Can You Rinse Your Mouth While Fasting?,"When fasting, are you allowed to put water in your mouth while making wudu?",There is nothing wrong with simply rinsing out the mouth while fasting so long as the water does not enter the throat of the fasting person.,,"Praise be to Allah.The believer is enjoined to do wudu properly . This was the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: “Do wudu properly, make water reach between the fingers and toes, and rinse the nose very thoroughly, except when you are fasting.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, al-Sawm, 788; Abu Dawud, 142; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 631) 
So he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) pointed out that we should avoid excessive rinsing of the mouth and nose when fasting , lest that lead to the thing which is forbidden, namely water getting into the throat whilst fasting . 
As for simply rinsing out the mouth whilst fasting, there is nothing wrong with that so long as the water does not enter the throat of the fasting person . 
Hence it was narrated in a sahih hadith that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab said: “I kissed (my wife) whilst I was fasting . I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, today I did something grievous, I kissed whilst I was fasting.’ He said, ‘What do you think about rinsing your mouth whilst you are fasting?’ I said, ‘There is nothing wrong with it.’ He said, ‘Then what’s wrong?’” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, al-Sawm, 2037; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Abi Dawud, no. 2089) 
The commentator on this hadith said concerning the words, ‘What do you think about rinsing your mouth whilst you are fasting?’, this is a sign of brilliant understanding, for rinsing the mouth does not invalidate the fast and it is the first step towards drinking.
And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
14069,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14069,A man doing ghusl for a woman from among his mahrams other than his wife,Is it permissible for a man to do ghusl for a woman from among his mahrams other than his wife?,,,"Praise be to Allah. It 
          is not permissible for a man to wash any female other than his wife, 
          whether they are his mahrams or not, apart from young girls who die 
          before the age of seven years, in which case he may wash her. On this 
          basis, if a woman were to die among men, and she does not have a husband 
          and there are no women present, tayammum should be done for her, instead 
          of wudoo’ and ghusl, with the purpose of protecting her ‘awrah. For 
          usually the one who does ghusl for the deceased, even if he just pours 
          water over the body, is bound to look at part of the ‘awrah and turn 
          the body over so that he can pour water over the entire body. So if 
          tayammum is done for a woman who has died and has only men around her, 
          that will be on the safe side with regard to protecting her ‘awrah. 
          With regard to a man doing ghusl for his slave woman, the same rulings 
          apply as in the case of his wife, if he owned her according to sharee’ah 
          and she was permissible for him, i.e., she was not married to another 
          man and was not within the ‘iddah period (following divorce or death

Then explain how and when Islam spred from Arabia to Europe adressing Islam's inpact on the Christian West as well as arabia and its surrounding regions.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    Our Prophet Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) did not produce his ideas by himself, rather the message that he 
    brought came from Allaah – it was Revelation (wahy) which Allaah sent to 
    him. 

    Secondly:  

    with regard to his life  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him):

    He was the best of all people on earth in terms of lineage, 
    for he was descended from the noblest line. Even his enemies bore witness to 
    that. Hence his enemy Abu Sufyaan testified to that effect before the 
    Byzantine ruler. The noblest of people were his people; the noblest of 
    tribes was his tribe; the noblest of clans was his clan. His full name was 
    Muhammad ibn [son of] ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib ibn Haashim ibn ‘Abd 
    Manaaf ibn Qusayy ibn Kilaab ibn Murrah ibn Ka’b ibn Lu’ayy ibn Ghaalib ibn 
    Fahr ibn Maalik ibn al-Nadar ibn Kinaanah ibn Khuzaymah ibn Mudrikah ibn 
    Ilyaas ibn Mudar ibn Nizaar ibn Ma’d ibn ‘Adnaan… ibn ‘Ismaa’eel [Ishmael] 
    ibn Ibraaheem [Abraham] (peace be upon them). 

    Allaah sent him as a Prophet at the age of forty, which is 
    the age of perfection. The first sign of Prophethood which was sent to the 
    Messenger of Allaah was dreams: he did not see any dream but it would come 
    true like daybreak. It was said that that lasted for six months. The period 
    of his Prophethood lasted for twenty-three years. These dreams were one of 
    the forty-six parts of Prophethood. Then Allaah honoured him with 
    Prophethood, and the angel came to him whilst he was in the cave of Hira’, 
    where he used to love to go to be alone. The first words (of the Qur’aan) to 
    be revealed to him were: 

    “Read! In the Name of your Lord Who has created (all that 
    exists)”

    [al-‘Alaq 96:1 – interpretation of the meaning]

    His message came in stages. Firstly, he was appointed as a 
    Prophet; secondly, he warned his nearest kinsmen; thirdly, he warned his 
    people; fourthly, he warned the people to whom no warner had ever come, 
    namely all the Arabs; fifthly, he warned all those whom his message reached, 
    both jinns and humans, until the end of time. 

    After that (initial revelation), he spent three years calling 
    people to Allaah in secret. Then the following words were revealed to him: 

    “Therefore proclaim openly (Allaah’s Message  
    Islamic Monotheism) that which you are commanded, and turn away from 
    Al‑Mushrikoon (polytheists, idolaters, and disbeliever”

    [al-Hijr 15:94 – interpretation of the meaning]

    See Zaad al-Ma’aad by Ibn al-Qayyim, 1/71 

    Thirdly: 

    With regard to the message to which our Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) called people, it is sufficient to 
    quote what was said by Abu Sufyaan – who was a kaafir (disbeliever) at the 
    time. Heraclius, the ruler of Byzantium, asked Abu Sufyaan, “What does he 
    tell you to do?” Abu Sufyaan said: “He tells us to worship Allaah alone, not 
    associating anything with Him, and he forbids us to worship that which our 
    fathers used to worship. He commands us to pray, to give in charity, to be 
    chaste, to keep our promises and fulfil our trusts.” Heraclius commented on 
    Abu Sufyaan’s words by saying: “This is the description of a Prophet. I knew 
    that he would appear, but I did not think that he would be from among you 
    [the Arabs]. If you are indeed speaking the truth, then soon he will take 
    possession of the place where my feet are standing. If I thought that I 
    could meet him I would not hesitate to go to him, and if I were with him I 
    would wash his feet.” 

    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2782; Muslim, 1773). 

    Fourthly: 

    After the death of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him), he was succeeded as khaleefah (leader of the Muslim 
    community) by Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq, during whose time a number of major 
    events took place: the dispatching of the army of Usaamah [to Syria]; the 
    wars against the apostates (ahl al-riddah); fighting those who refused to 
    pay the zakaah; the emergence of Musaylimah the liar [a false prophet]; and 
    the compilation of the Qur’aan. 

    Then came ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, who was one of the earliest 
    Muslims, one of the ten whom the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) had testified would enter Paradise, one of the Rightly Guided 
    Caliphs (al-khulafa’ al-raashideen), one of the in-laws of the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), one of the greatest 
    scholars and ascetics among the Sahaabah (the Companions of the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)). Many conquests took place 
    during his time, including the conquest of Damascus, Jordan, Iraq, Jerusalem 
    and Egypt. He is the one who decided, in consultation with ‘Ali, that 
    history should be dated from the time of the Hijrah (the migration of the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) from Makkah to 
    Madeenah). 

    He was martyred in 23 AH by the kaafir Magian murderer Abu 
    Lu’lu’ah. 

    Then came ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan, who was also one of the ten 
    whom the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had 
    testified would enter Paradise. He had also become Muslim in the earliest 
    days. He was one of those whom Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq had called to Islam. He 
    migrated twice, first to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) then to Madeenah. He married 
    Ruqayyah the daughter of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him), then she passed away and he married her sister Umm Kalthoom. He 
    ruled as khaleefah for twelve years, then he was martyred in 35 AH at the 
    age of eighty-odd. 

    Then came ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib, who was also one of the ten 
    whom the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had 
    testified would enter Paradise. He was the brother of the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) according to the 
    system of brotherhood established when the muhaajiroon (migrants from 
    Makkah) first came to Madeenah, and he was also the Prophet’s son-in-law as 
    he married his daughter Faatimah, the best of all women (may Allaah be 
    pleased with her). He was also one of the first people to become Muslim, one 
    of the greatest scholars, bravest warriors, prominent ascetics and 
    preachers. He was one of those who compiled the Qur’aan and showed it to the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 

    Fifthly: 

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    was guided by the teachings of the Qur’aan, indeed his whole attitude was 
    the Qur’aan as the Mother of the Believers ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased 
    with her) said. The way our Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) was in Islam was the same as the way he had been before, but 
    Allaah perfected his character and made it more beautiful. When the first 
    revelation came, [his wife] Khadeejah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said, 
    listing his attributes:

    “No, by Allaah, Allaah would never let you down. For you 
    uphold ties of kinship, you help the weak, you give charity to the poor, you 
    honour your guests and you help the deserving calamity-afflicted ones.”

    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4; Muslim, 160) 

    Both his companions and his enemies described him in a 
    befitting manner, as he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    deserved, saying that he was honourable, brave, merciful, well-spoken, 
    worshipped a great deal, was honest and trustworthy, and so on. 

    This was all summed up in the verse: 

    “And verily, you (O Muhammad) are on an exalted (standard 
    of) character”

    [al-Qalam 68:4 – interpretation of the meaning]

    His good character and attitude had a great effect, as it was 
    the reason for some of the mushrikeen (pagans, polytheists) coming to 
    Islam. 

    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: “The Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent some cavalry towards Najd, 
    and they brought a man from Banu Haneefah whose name was Thamaamah ibn 
    Athaal and tied him to one of the pillars of the mosque. The Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came out and said, ‘Untie 
    Thamaamah.’ Then he (Thamaamah) went to grove of palm trees near the mosque 
    and washed himself (did ghusl), then he entered the mosque and said, ‘I bear 
    witness that there is no god except Allaah and that Muhammad is the 
    Messenger of Allaah.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4114; Muslim, 1764). 

    Sixthly: 

    With regard to Islam reaching Europe, it did so in several 
    ways, including the following: 

    1 – The keenness of the Muslims to convey the truth to all of 
    mankind. Andalusia [in Spain] was conquered by Taariq ibn Ziyaad in 92 
    AH/711 CE, and the conquests in western Europe continued until they reached 
    southeastern France in 114 AH. 

    2 – People coming from North Africa, the Middle East and 
    South Asia to look for work and a better future. 

    3 – Westerners bringing some people from other countries, 
    such as the Germans bringing Turks, to work in their country. 

    4 – The presence of Muslim daa’iyahs (callers, 
    “missionaries”) in those countries. 

    5 – The conquests of the Ottoman state of part of Europe. 

    6 – The conversion of some indigenous Europeans to Islam, who 
    then began to propagate Islam. 

    7 – Trade links between Muslims and Europe. 

    8 – Conversion of some Europeans to Islam. 

    9 – Changes in the European intellectual approaches.

     10 – Rejection of the church myths which contradict 
    revelation and the adoption of empirical knowledge whose foundation was laid 
    by the Muslims. 

    11 – Participation of Muslim communities in the development 
    of research, inventions and companies in Europe, through the work of 
    qualified Muslim professionals, plus the increase in the number of Muslim 
    communities in Europe, which resulted in the increase in the number of 
    mosques, schools and Islamic centers. This has resulted in increased Muslim 
    influence, to the extent that the enemies of Islam such as the Jews are 
    scared. The Israeli newspaper “Ha-eretz” said, in an issue published 
    in late June 2001 CE, “As is the case in western Europe, the great increase 
    in the number of Muslims in the United States has led to an increase in 
    their political influence… The increase in the number of Muslims and their 
    increasing political awareness, especially the Arab students, who are the 
    most active of the Arabs in the political field, and the decrease in the 
    number of Jews as a result of mixed marriages and their assimilation into 
    American society, will all, in the future, play a role in changing the 
    balance of power and changing the influence that these competing groups have 
    in Washington. This is now something tangible, as can be seen in the 
    activities of the pro-Arab lobbies in Congress.

    1.The increase in the number of 
    Muslims in European counties. More than ten years ago the number of Muslims 
    in Europe was approximately 12 million.

    2.The spread of mosques, Islamic 
    centers and schools.

    3.The spread of hijaab and 
    Islamic dress in the capitals of European countries.

    4.The holding of Islamic 
    exhibitions and seminars, and the establishment of companies that take care 
    of halaal slaughter of meat, and burying the dead in the manner prescribed 
    in Islam.

14071,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14071,It is better not to buy in installments if you are able to pay in cash,Is it permissible for me to buy something by installments when I am able to pay for it in cash? Please note that the price when bought in installments is greater than the price if I pay in cash.,,,"Praise be to Allah.We have already stated in the answer to 
    question no. 13973 that selling something by installments for a higher price is 
    permissible. 
Although it is permissible, we should not be 
    too lax on this matter, especially if there is no need for it, because buying by installments means buying with debt, and we should not be too lax 
    when it comes to taking loans; rather we should not seek loans unless there is a need for it and it is essential. 
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) used to seek refuge with Allaah from debt. 
Al-Bukhaari (833) narrated from ‘Aa’ishah 
    (may Allaah be pleased with her) that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to make du’aa’ in his prayer 
    and say, “Allaahumma inni a’oodhu bika min ‘adhaab il-qabr, wa a’oodhu bika min fitnat il-maseeh il-dajjaal, wa a’oodhu bika min fitnat 
    il-mahya wa fitnat il-mamaat; Allaahumma inni a’oodhi bika min al-ma’tham wa’l-maghram (O Allaah, I seek refuge with You from the torment of 
    the grave; I seek refuge with You from the fitnah of the Dajjaal; I seek refuge with You from the trials of life and death; O Allaah, I seek 
    refuge with You from sin and debt).”  Someone said to him, “How often you seek refuge with Allaah from debt!” He said, “If a man gets into debt, 
    he speaks and lies, he makes a promise then breaks it.” And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to call on people to pay off 
    debts.  
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) also used to say in his du’aa’: “Allaahumma anta al-awwal fa laysa qablaka shay’un, wa anta al-aakhir fa laysa ba’daka 
    shay’un, wa anta al-zaahir fa laysa fawqaka shay’un, wa anta al-baatin fa laysa doonaka shay’un, iqdi ‘anna al-dayn wa aghnina min al-faqr (O 
    Allaah, You are the First and there is nothing before You, You are the Last and there is nothing after You, You are the Most High and there is 
    nothing above You, and You are the Most Near and there is nothing closer than You. Settle our debt for us and spare us from poverty).” 
Hence no one should buy by installments when 
    he is able to pay the whole price immediately, because then he is getting into debt when he has no need to, and he is exposing himself to danger, 
    because if a person dies in debt he will not be forgiven, even if he dies as a shaheed on the battlefield, until his debt is paid off. 
Muslim narrated (1886) from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn 
    ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The shaheed will be forgiven for every sin 
    except debt.” 
And al-Nasaa’i narrated (4605) that Muhammad 
    ibn Jahsh (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: We were sitting with the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    when he raised his head towards the sky, then he put his palm on his forehead and said: “Subhaan-Allaah!  What a strict issue has been revealed to 
    me!” We remained silent and were afraid. The following morning I asked him, “O Messenger of Allaah, what is this strict issue that has been 
    revealed?” He said, “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, if a man were killed in battle for the sake of Allaah, then brought back to life, then 
    killed and brought back to life again, then killed, and he owed a debt, he would not enter Paradise until his debt was paid off.” Classed as hasan 
    by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i, 4367. 
The point is that if you are well off and you 
    do not need the money you have, and you think it most likely that you will not need it in the near future, then it is better for you to pay cash 
    and not to purchase by installments. 
And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
14073,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14073,Doing ghusl for  Jumu`ah is prescribed as Sunnah when getting ready to go to the prayer,"Does the obligatory ghusl done before Fajr exempt one from also having to do ghusl for  Jumu`ah, or not?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Sunnah is to do ghusl on Friday when getting ready to go to Jumu`ah, and it is preferable to do that when one is about to head for the mosque, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you goes to Jumu`ah, let him do ghusl.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, al- Jumu`ah, 882 – this version was narrated by him; Muslim, al- Jumu`ah, 845). 
If one does ghusl at the beginning of the day, that is sufficient, because ghusl on Fridays is a confirmed Sunnah (Sunnah mu’akkadah), and some scholars said that it is obligatory. So this ghusl should be done regularly on Fridays, preferably when one is about to set out for the mosque, as stated above, because this is more clean, and more likely to put a stop to offensive odours. One should also take care to apply perfume and wear nice clothes. When setting out for the mosque one should take care to be solemn in one’s demeanour, and to make his stride short, because each step wipes out a bad deed and Allah raises a person one degree thereby. So he should proceed in a solemn and careful manner. When he reaches the mosque, he should enter with his right foot first, send blessings and peace upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and mention the name of Allah, and say, “A’oodhu Billaah il-‘Azeem wa bi wajhih il-kareem wa sultaanih il-qadeem min al-shaytaan il-rajeem; Allahumma iftah li abwaab rahmatika (Is seek refuge with Allah the Almighty and in His noble Face and His eternal Dominion, from the accursed Shaytaan; O Allah, open to me the gates of Your mercy).” Then he should pray as much as Allah wills he should pray. He should not push between two people. After that he should sit and wait, either reading Qur’aan, or reciting dhikr and prayers for forgiveness, or in silence, until the imaam comes. He should listen attentively when the imaam gives the khutbah, then he should pray with him. If he does that then he will have attained a great deal of good. It says in a saheeh hadeeth that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does ghusl, then comes to Jumu`ah and prays whatever Allah wills that he should pray, then listens attentively to the khateeb until he finishes the khutbah, then prays with him, will be forgiven his sins between that and the other Friday plus three days.” (Narrated by Muslim, al- Jumu`ah, 1418). That is because a good deed earns a tenfold reward.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), part 12, p. 404"
14075,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14075,There is no regular Sunnah prayer before Jumu’ah,Is there any Sunnah prayer before or after Jumu’ah?,,,"Praise be to Allah.There is no regular Sunnah prayer before Jumu’ah according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, but it prescribed for the Muslim, when he comes to the mosque, to pray whatever Allah enables him to pray, saying salaam after each two rak’ahs, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The prayers of the night and the day [i.e., other than the obligatory prayers] are two by two.” (Narrated by Imaam Ahmad and the authors of Sunan with a hasan isnaad; the original is to be found in al-Saheeh without any mention of the day.) 
And many saheeh reports indicate that what is prescribed for the Muslim when he comes to the mosque on Friday is to pray whatever Allah wills he should pray before the imaam comes out. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not specify whether it should be two or four or more. All of that is good, but the minimum is two rak’ahs to “greet the mosque.”  
With regard to after Jumu’ah, there is a regular Sunnah prayer, the minimum of which is two rak’ahs and the maximum is four, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Whoever among you prays after Jumu’ah, let him pray four (rak’ahs)” (narrated by Muslim, al-Jumu’ah, 8881). And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray two rak’ahs after Jumu’ah in his house. May Allah help us all to do that which pleases Him.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), part 12, vol. 386"
14076,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14076,Is it permissible to give a fatwa based on taqleed,Is it permissible to give a fatwa based on taqleed?,,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          There are various opinions on this matter. 
 
          Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
 
          The first view is that it is not permissible to give 
          a fatwa based on taqleed [Translator’s 
          note: Taqleed [lit. imitation] means repeating the views of scholars 
          to others without knowing the details or basis of their fatwas]  
          , because that is not knowledge, and giving a fatwa without knowledge 
          is haraam. There is no dispute among people that taqleed is not the 
          same as knowledge and that the muqallid (the one who imitates or repeats 
          the views of others) cannot be given the name of ‘aalim (scholar). This 
          is the view of most of our companions and the view of the majority of 
          Shaafa’is. 
 
          The second view is that it is permissible with regard 
          to himself; he may follow the view of one of the scholars if the fatwa 
          is with regard to himself only. But it is not permissible for him to 
          repeat the views of a scholar in giving a fatwa to someone else. This 
          is the view of Ibn Battah and others among our companions. Al-Qaadi 
          said: Ibn Battah mentioned in his letters to al-Barmaki: it is not permitted 
          for a person to issue a fatwa based on what he had heard from a scholar 
          who issued a fatwa. Rather it is permissible for him to follow that 
          scholar’s view with regard to himself, but repeating his views and issuing 
          a fatwa to someone else, this is not permitted. 
 
          The third view is that this is permitted when necessary 
          and when there is no scholar who is qualified to make ijtihaad. This 
          is the most correct view and this is our guideline. Al-Qaadi said: Abu 
          Hafs said in his comments: I heard Abu ‘Ali al-Hasan ibn ‘Abd-Allaah 
          al-Najjaad say: I heard Abu’l-Husayn ibn Bashraan say: what I may criticize 
          a man for is learning five issues of fiqh from Ahmad then sitting by 
          a pillar in the mosque [i.e., setting himself up as a scholar] and issuing 
          fatwas based on that.","I’laam al-Muwaqqi’een, 1/37, 38"
14079,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14079,Reward for Raising Three Daughters- For Mom or Dad?,"The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever has three daughters and is patient with them and gives them to drink and clothes them, they will be a protection for him against the Fire.” Will they be a protection against the Fire for their father only, or will their mother have a share in that too? I have three daughters, praise be to Allaah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The hadeeth applies to both the father and the mother. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also said, “Whoever has two daughters and treats them kindly, they will be a protection for him against the Fire.” The same applies if he has sisters or paternal or maternal aunts etc., and he treats them kindly, we hope that he will attain Paradise for that. For when he treats them kindly, he deserves a great reward and to be protected from the Fire, so he will be kept away from the Fire because of his good deed. 
This applies only to Muslims, because if a Muslim does these good deeds seeking the pleasure of Allaah, he will have earned salvation from the Fire. There are many means of gaining salvation from the Fire and admittance to Paradise, so the believer should try to attain many of them. Islam itself is the only means and is the basic cause of gaining admittance to Paradise and salvation from the Fire. 
There are actions which, if the Muslim does them, he will enter Paradise and be saved from Hell, such as taking care of daughters or sisters, then they will be a protection for him against the Fire. Whoever dies leaving behind three little ones who have not yet reached the age of puberty, they will be a protection for him against the Fire. They said, “O Messenger of Allaah, what about two?” He said, “And two.” They did not ask him about one. It was narrated in a saheeh (authentic) report that he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah says, if I take from My slave the one whom he loves most in this world and he bears that with patience seeking reward from Me, he will have no less a reward than Paradise.” So Allaah explains that the believing slave has no less a reward with Him than Paradise, if He takes one whom he loves of the people of this world, and he bears that with patience and seeks reward. One of our little ones is included in this hadeeth, if Allaah takes him and causes him to die, and his father or mother or both bear that with patience and seek reward, then they will have Paradise. This is a great bounty from Allaah. The same applies to husbands, wives and all other relatives and friends, if they are patient and seek reward then they are included in this hadeeth, so long as they take care to avoid anything which could prevent that, such as dying committing major sin. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz , vol. 4, p. 375"
14082,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14082,Important books for the seeker of Islamic knowledge,"We would like some advice about the books which the seeker of Islamic knowledge should obtain, study and refer to.",,,"Praise be to Allah.1 – ‘Aqeedah (basic tenets of faith): 
1-    Thalaathat al-Usool
2-    Al-Qawaa’id al-Arba’ah
3-    Kashf al-Shubahaat
4-    Al-Tawheed 
These four books were written by Shaykh al-Islam Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allah have mercy on him). 
5-     Al-‘Aqeedah al-Waasitiyyah which deals with Tawheed al-Asmaa’ wa’l-Sifaat (The Oneness of the Divine names and attributes). This is one of the best books written on this topic, and it is worth reading and studying.
6-    Al-Hamawiyyah
7-    Al-Tadmuriyyah 
These two books are more comprehensive than al-Waasitiyyah. These three books were written by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah. 
8-     Al-‘Aqeedah al-Tahhaawiyyah, by Shaykh Abu Ja’far Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tahhaawi
9-     Sharh al-‘Aqeedah al-Tahhaawiyyah by Abu’l-Hasan ‘Ali ibn Abi’l-‘Izz
10-Al-Durar al-Saniyyah fi’l-Ajoobah al-Najdiyyah, compiled by Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Qaasim (may Allah have mercy on him)
11-Al-Durrah al-Madiyyah fi ‘Aqeedah al-Firqah al-Mardiyyah by Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Safaareeni al-Hanbali. 
This book contains some general statements which go against the madhhab of the salaf, such as his saying, “Our Lord is not an essence or an attribute or a physical entity, exalted be He.” 
Therefore the seeker of knowledge has to study it with a shaykh who is well versed in the ‘aqeedah of the salaf, so that he can explain the general statements in it that go against the ‘aqeedah of the righteous salaf. 
2 – Hadeeth 
1-     Fath al-Baari Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhaari, by Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqallaani (may Allah have mercy on him).
2-     Subul al-Salaam Sharh Buloogh al-Maraam, by al-San’aani, and his book Jaami’ bayna al-Hadeeth wa’l-Fiqh
3-     Nayl al-Awtaar Sharh Muntaqaa al-Akhbaar by al-Shawkaani
4-     ‘Umdat al-Ahkaam by al-Maqdisi. This is an abridged book; most of its ahaadeeth are narrated in al-Saheehayn so their authenticity does not need to be researched.
5-     Al-Arba’een al-Nawawiyyah, by Abu Zakariyya al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him). This is a good book because it includes etiquette and a good methodology, and important basic principles, such as the hadeeth, “Part of a person’s being a good Muslim is his leaving alone that which does not concern him.”
(Narrated by Imaam Ahmad, 1 – 201; al-Tirmidhi, 2318; classed as hasan by al-Nawawi in Riyaadh al-Saaliheen, 73; classed as saheeh by Ahmad Shaakir in al-Musnad, 1737)
This principle – if one made it the path upon which one walks – would be sufficient. Another principle is given concerning when one should speak, “Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him say something good or else remain silent.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, Kitaab al-Adab; Muslim, Kitaab al-Luqtah, Baab al-Diyaafah).
6-     Buloogh al-Maraam, by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqallaani. This is a very useful book, especially because it mentions the narrators, and quoted the opinions of others scholars, who said whose hadeeth is saheeh and whose is da’eef, and he comments on the hadeeth to say whether they are saheeh or da’eef.
7-     Nukhbat al-Fikr  by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqallaani. This is considered to be a comprehensive work. If the seeker of knowledge understands it completely then he will have no need of many other books of mustalah (the science of hadeeth). Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) has a useful way of writing, which involves examining every issue in depth and categorizing the topics he discusses. If the seeker of knowledge reads it he will find it stimulating, because it is based on making one think. I say: it is good for the seeker of knowledge to memorize it because it is a useful summary of the science of mustalah (science of hadeeth).
8-     The Six Books (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, Muslim, al-Nasaa’i, Abu Dawood, Ibn Maajah and al-Tirmidhi). I advise the seeker of knowledge to read them often, because that will serve two purposes: reviewing the main sources of Islam and reviewing the names of hadeeth narrators. If you often review the names of hadeeth narrators, then whenever you come across the name of one of the narrators of al-Bukhaari in any isnaad, you will know that this is one of the narrators of al-Bukhaari, so you will benefit from this knowledge of hadeeth. 
3 – Books of fiqh: 
1-     Aadaab al-mashiy ila’l-Salaah by Shaykh al-Islam Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allah have mercy on him)
2-     Zaad al-Mustaqni’ fi Ikhtisaar al-Muqni’ by al-Hajjaawi. This is one of the best texts of fiqh. It is a blessed book, brief and comprehensive. Our shaykh, ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) told us to memorize it, even though he had memorized the text of Daleel al-Taalib.
3-     Al-Rawd al-Murbi’ Sharh Zaad al-Mustaqni’ by Shaykh Mansoor al-Bahooti
4-     ‘Umdat al-Fiqh by Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him)
5-     al-Usool min ‘Ilm al-Usool. This is an abridged book which serves as an introduction for the seeker of knowledge. 
4 – Faraa’id (laws of inheritance) 
1-     Matn al-Rahbiyyah by al-Rahbi
2-     Matn al-Burhaaniyyah by Muhammad al-Burhaani. This is a useful and comprehensive abridged book dealing with all the laws of inheritance. I think that al-Burhaaniyyah is more comprehensive than al-Rahbiyyah in some ways, and it gives more information. 
5 – Tafseer 
1-     Tafseer al-Quran al-‘Azeem by Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him). This book is good for tafseer based on reports and it is useful and trustworthy. But it does not pay much attention to matters of grammar and style.
2-     Tayseer al-Kareem al-Rahmaan fi Tafseer Kalaam al-Mannaan by Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him). This is a good, easy and trustworthy book, and I recommend it.
3-     Muqaddimah Shaykh al-Islam fi’l-Tafseer. This is an important introduction.
4-     Adwaa’ al-Bayaan by al-‘Allaamah Muhammad al-Shanqeeti (may Allah have mercy on him). This is a comprehensive book covering hadeeth, fiqh, tafseer and usool al-fiqh. 
6 – General books on some subjects: 
1-     On (Arabic) grammar: Matn al-Ajroomiyyah. This is an abridged book.
2-     Also on Arabic grammar: Alfiyyah Ibn Maalik; this is a summary of the science of grammar.
3-     On Seerah (Prophet’s biography): The best book that I have seen is Zaad al-Ma’aad by Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him). This is a very useful book in which he mentions the biography of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) from all Angles, then he discusses many rulings.
4-     Rawdat al-‘Uqalaa’ by Ibn Hibbaan al-Busti (may Allah have mercy on him). This is a useful book despite its brevity. He compiled a large amount of useful material and stories of the scholars, muhadditheen and others.
5-     Siyar A’laam al-Nubalaa’ by al-Dhahabi. This book is very useful and the seeker of knowledge should read and refer to it.","From Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, Kitaab al-‘Ilm, p. 92"

Are they humans who were turned into monkeys for disobeying Allahs commandments? if so which people were they and what did they do?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Maskh (transformation) refers to the changing of a person’s exterior appearance. Allaah has told us in more than one place in the Qur’aan that He transformed some of the Children of Israel into monkeys as a punishment for their disobedience towards Allaah. Allaah says, addressing the Children of Israel (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And indeed you knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath (i.e. Saturday). We said to them: ‘Be you monkeys, despised and rejected.’
So We made this punishment an example to their own and to succeeding generations and a lesson to those who are Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)”
[al-Baqarah 2:65-66] 
And Allaah tells us their story in more detail in Soorat al-A’raaf, where He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And ask them (O Muhammad) about the town that was by the sea; when they transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath (i.e. Saturday): when their fish came to them openly on the Sabbath day, and did not come to them on the day they had no Sabbath. Thus We made a trial of them, for they used to rebel against Allaah’s Command (disobey Allaah)
 And when a community among them said: ‘Why do you preach to a people whom Allaah is about to destroy or to punish with a severe torment?’ (The preachers) said: ‘In order to be free from guilt before your Lord (Allaah), and perhaps they may fear Allaah.’
So when they forgot the reminders that had been given to them, We rescued those who forbade evil, but with a severe torment We seized those who did wrong because they used to rebel against Allaah’s Command (disobey Allaah).
So when they exceeded the limits of what they were prohibited, We said to them: ‘Be you monkeys, despised and rejected’”
[al-A’raaf 7:163-166] 
And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say: ‘O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Do you criticize us for no other reason than that we believe in Allaah, and in (the Revelation) which has been sent down to us and in that which has been sent down before (us), and that most of you are Faasiqoon [rebellious and disobedient (to Allaah)]?’
Say (O Muhammad to the people of the Scripture): ‘Shall I inform you of something worse than that, regarding the recompense from Allaah: those (Jews) who incurred the Curse of Allaah and His Wrath, and those of whom (some) He transformed into monkeys and swines, and those who worshipped Taaghoot (false deities); such are worse in rank (on the Day of Resurrection in the Hell-fire), and far more astray from the Right Path (in the life of this world)’”
[al-Maa’idah 5:59-60] 
This transformation was a punishment from Allaah to them for their doing that which Allaah had forbidden to them. This punishment was not exclusively for the Children of Israel, rather the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us that the Hour will not begin until such transformation happens among this ummah too. He issued this warning to those who disbelieve in the divine decree (al-qadr), and those who drink alcohol and listen to singing – we seek refuge with Allaah from that. 
Ibn Maajah (4059) narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Shortly before the Hour begins, people will be transformed into monkeys and pigs, swallowed up in the earth, and pelted with stones.” (Saheeh Ibn Maajah, 3280). 
Being swallowed up in the earth means that the earth will split open and swallow up a person, house or city, just as Allaah caused the earth to swallow Qaaroon and his household. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning); 
“So We caused the earth to swallow him”
[al-Qasas 28:81] 
Pelting with stones is the same as Allaah did to the people of Loot. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and rained down on them stones of baked clay”
[al-Hijr 15:74] 
Al-Tirmidhi (2152) narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: “I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, ‘Among this ummah those who disbelieve in the divine decree (al-qadr) will be swallowed up by the earth, transformed into monkeys and pigs or pelted with stones.” (Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 1748). 
And al-Tirmidhi (2212) narrated from ‘Imraan ibn Husayn that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Among this ummah, people will be transformed into monkeys and pigs, swallowed up in the earth, and pelted with stones.” A man among the Muslims said, “O Messenger of Allaah, when will that be?” He said, “When singing-girls and musical instruments become widespread and wine is drunk.” (Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 1802). 
These ahaadeeth indicate that such transformations will happen in this ummah as a punishment for some sins. So let the Muslim beware of doing anything that Allaah has forbidden. Woe be to the one who provokes the anger, wrath and vengeance of Allaah. May Allaah keep us all safe from the things that incur His punishment. 
But these monkeys and pigs that exist nowadays are not the people from the earlier nations who were transformed, because Allaah does not enable those who have been transformed to have offspring, rather He causes them to die after being transformed, so they have no offspring. 
Muslim (2663) narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood said: “A man said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, are the monkeys and pigs those who have been transformed?’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Allaah does not enable those who have been transformed to have offspring or children. The monkeys and pigs existed before that.’” al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “The Prophet’s words ‘The monkeys and pigs existed before that’ means that they existed before the Children of Israel were transformed, which indicates that they are not from among those who were transformed.”

14090,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14090,Ruling on delaying marriage because of studies for one who fears that he may do something haraam,"I was born and raised a Christian, however since learning about Islam I have recently converted. Before my conversion I allowed a fallen Muslim to touch me. Since then I have not allowed for any touching, inappropriate words, or unsupervised visits. I have repented and so has he of these terrible acts. His parents are helping me to understand and follow the Quran. He has asked me to marry him, and I wish to do so. The problem is this: his parents wish for him to wait to marry until after college. Should I wait to be engaged or should I become engaged immediately?  I know that it is better to marry than to commit immoral sexual acts, and I am afraid that these acts will be very tempting, especially in our minds, even if we do not see each other alone (which I do not wish to do). I want to respect and love his family, and I do not know how to appropriately arrange for such things as marriage when they are the only Muslims I know. PLEASE HELP! I want to enter into a moral arrangement and I do not want to be a girlfriend!",,,"Praise be to Allah.Who has guided you to Islam, and has bestowed this great blessing upon you. We ask Him to keep you steadfast. One of the blessings that Allaah has bestowed upon you is that Islam wipes out whatever sins came before it, and we ask Him to accept your repentance and the repentance of everyone who repents. 
With regard to engagement and marriage, our advice to you and to this young man is to hasten to get married if possible, especially since you are afraid of doing something haraam. In this case, the issue of marriage takes priority over the issue of studying. So long as marriage is what you both want, you should try hard to convince his parents of that. Remind them of what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to the young men: “O young men, whoever among you can afford to get married, let him do so, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and in guarding one’s chastity. Whoever cannot afford that, then he should fast, for that will be a shield for him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5065; Muslim, 1400.  
He can also remind them of how many temptations there are, and that the Muslim has to resist them by every legitimate shar’i means available. Undoubtedly marriage is one of the greatest means of protecting oneself against these temptations. Indeed, the scholars state that marriage is obligatory in such cases. (al-Mughni, 9/341). It may be sufficient to do the marriage contract which meets the conditions stipulated in sharee’ah, until you are able to do the waleemah (wedding feast) and consummate the marriage, because this will make it permissible for him to be alone with you and to touch you, because in this case he will be considered to be your husband according to sharee’ah. If you can do that, this is good. But if his family insist on refusing, and this young man is afraid of doing something haraam, then he must try hard to get married if he is able to, even if his parents do not give him permission, whilst also trying to please his family as much as he can. If he is unable to do that, then either you have to be patient and follow the advice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to those who were not able to get married, which is to fast, and try to keep away from places of temptation and situations in which desire may be provoked, until Allaah brings you together in a good way, or your legal guardian (wali) has to try to look for another righteous person for you to marry, so that you will be safe from the risk of doing something haraam. 
It should be noted here that if you become engaged according to sharee’ah, that does not mean that he is allowed to sit with you or to touch you or to go out with you or to speak to you unnecessarily, until the marriage contract is done between you, fulfilling all the conditions stipulated in sharee’ah.

Before that, he used to commit some sins. He says, “I heard a hadeeth of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), ‘Whoever has wronged his brother with regard to his honour or anything else, let him ask him for forgiveness today before there is no dinar and no dirham.’ What do you advise me to do?”",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah has enjoined repentance 
          upon His slaves, as He says (interpretation of the meanings):  
          
“And all of you 
          beg Allaah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful” 
          
[al-Noor 24:31]  
“O you who believe! 
          Turn to Allaah with sincere repentance!” 
[al-Tahreem 66:8]  
“And verily, I 
          am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and 
          associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and 
          then remains constant in doing them (till his death)” 
[Ta-Ha 20:82]  
And the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The one who repents 
          from sin is like one who has never sinned.”  
Whoever commits any sin 
          must repent, regret what he has done, give it up, keep away from it 
          and resolve not to go back to it. Allaah accepts the repentance of those 
          who repent.  
When a person sincerely 
          repents by regretting what he has done and resolving not to repeat it, 
          and he gives it up out of respect and fear of Allaah, then Allaah accepts 
          his repentance and wipes out his past sins by His grace and kindness.  
          
But if the sin involved 
          wrongdoing against someone else, then the sinner has to do what he is 
          obliged to do by repenting from what has happened, regretting it, giving 
          it up and resolving not to do it again. He must also restore the rights 
          of the one whom he wronged, or seek his forgiveness , such as saying, 
          Please forgive me,” etc. Or he should give him his dues, because of 
          the hadeeth quoted in the question, or other ahaadeeth and aayahs. The 
          Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever has done 
          some wrong to his brother, let him seek his forgiveness today before 
          there is no dinar or dirham, when if he has some righteous deeds (to 
          his credit), some of his hasanaat (good deeds) will be taken in proportion 
          to his wrongdoing, and if he has no hasanaat some of the sayi’aat (bad 
          deeds) of the one whom he wronged will be taken and added to his burden.” 
          (Narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh). So the believer should 
          strive to put things right and restore his brother’s rights. So he should 
          either give him his dues or ask him for his forgiveness. If it has to 
          do with his honour then he has to ask for his forgiveness if he can. 
          If he cannot, or he fears the consequences of telling him or that telling 
          him about what he said will cause more trouble, then he should pray 
          for forgiveness for him and make du’aa’ for him, and mention his good 
          points that he knows of , to compensate for saying bad things, aiming 
          to wash away something bad with something good. So he should speak of 
          his good points that he knows of and spread good words about him to 
          counteract the bad things which he said before, and he should pray for 
          forgiveness for him and make du’aa’ for him. In this way the problem

Should you recite du'a al-qunut in witr prayer all the time?


Formula of du'a al-qunut


What to say after taslim if you recite du'a al-qunut","Praise be to Allah.When to recite du'a al-qunut
Du'a al-Qunut is recited in the last rak’ah of Witr prayer, after bowing, but if one recites it before bowing it doesn’t matter. But reciting it after bowing is better. 
Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said in Majmu' al-Fatawa (23/100): 
With regard to qunut: there are two extreme views and one middle (or moderate) view. Some say that qunut should only be recited before bowing and some say that it should only be recited after bowing. The jurists among the scholars of hadith, such as Ahmad and others, say that both are allowed, because both are mentioned in the sahih Sunnah, but they preferred reciting qunut after bowing because this is mentioned more often.  
Raising the hands is mentioned in a sahih report from  ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), as was narrated by al-Bayhaqi in a report which he classed as sahih, 2/210). 
How to offer du'a al-qunut
The worshipper should raise his hands to chest height and no more , because this du'a is not a du'a of supplication in which a person needs to raise his hands high. Rather it is a du'a of hope in which a person holds out his palms towards heaven… The apparent meaning of the scholar’s words is that the worshipper should hold his hands close together like a beggar who asks someone else to give him something. 
Should you recite du'a al-qunut in witr prayer all the time?
It is better not to recite qunut in witr all the time , rather it should be done sometimes, because there is no evidence that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did it all the time. But he taught al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) a du'a to recite in qunut al-witr, as will be quoted below. 
Formula of du'a al-qunut
The du'a of qunut was narrated by Abu Dawud (1425), al-Tirmidhi (464), and al-Nasai (1746) from al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught me some words to say in qunut al-witr: 
“Allahumma ihdini fiman hadayta wa ‘afini fiman ‘afayta wa tawallani fiman tawallayta wa barik li fima a’tayta, wa qini sharra ma qadayta , fa innaka taqdi wa la yuqda ‘alayk, wa innahu la yadhillu man walayta wa la ya’izzu man ‘adayta, tabarakta Rabbana wa ta’alayta la manja minka illa ilayk
(O Allah, guide me among those whom You have guided, pardon me among those whom You have pardoned, turn to me in friendship among those on whom You have turned in friendship, and bless me in what You have bestowed, and save me from the evil of what You have decreed. For verily You decree and none can influence You; and he is not humiliated whom You have befriended, nor is he honoured who is Your enemy. Blessed are You, O Lord, and Exalted. There is no place of safety from You except with You).” 
The last phrase – La manja minka illa ilayka (There is no place of safety from You except with You) – was narrated by Ibn Mandah in al-Tawhid and classed as hasan by al-Albani. (Irwa al-Ghalil, hadith no. 426, 429)
Then he should send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). (al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 4/14-52)
What to say after taslim if you recite du'a al-qunut
It is mustahabb to say after the taslim: Subhan al-Malik al-Quddus three times, elongating the vowels the third time, as narrated by al-Nasai (1699) and classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih Sunan al-Nasai. 
Al-Daraqutni added the word: Rabb al-Malaikah wa’l-Ruh (Lord of the angels and the Spirit), with a sahih isnad. See Zad al-Ma’ad by Ibn al-Qayyim, 1/337.

But if chess does not distract us from our obligations or involve anything that is haram, then there is a difference of scholarly opinion concerning the ruling.","Is chess haram?


Companions’ views on playing chess


Scholars’ views on playing chess","Praise be to Allah.Is chess haram?
Imam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“When chess distracts us from what we are obliged to do both inwardly and outwardly, it is haram according to the consensus of the scholars – such as when it distracts from an obligatory duty such as prayer or anything that is necessary in the interests of oneself or one’s family, or enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, or upholding ties of kinship or honouring one’s parents, or any obligations connected to positions of authority or leadership, etc. 
In this case it is haram according to the consensus of the scholars. Similarly, if it involves anything that is haram such as telling lies, swearing false oaths, cheating, wrongdoing or helping in wrongdoing, or other forbidden things, then it is haram according to the consensus of the Muslims.” (Adapted from Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 32/218, 240) 
But if it does not distract us from our obligations or involve anything that is haram, then there is a difference of scholarly opinion concerning the ruling. The majority of scholars (Abu Hanifah, Malik, Ahmad and some of the companions of al-Shafi`i) said that it is also haram, basing that view on the evidence of the Book of Allah and the opinions of the Companions. 
The evidence of the Quran is the words (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al-Ansab [stone altars set up for sacrifices to idols etc], and Al-Azlam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytan’s (Satan’s) handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.
Shaytan (Satan) wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants (alcoholic drinks) and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from As-Salah (the prayer). So, will you not then abstain?” [Al-Maidah 5:90-91]
Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“This verse indicates that it is haram to play dice or chess , whether that involves gambling or not, because when Allah forbade alcohol He explained the reason for that, which is ‘Shaytan (Satan) wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants (alcoholic drinks) and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from the prayer.’ 
So every kind of game in which a little leads to a lot and stirs up enmity and hatred between those who are devoted to it and prevents them from remembering Allah and praying, is like drinking alcohol, which implies that it must be haram like alcohol.” (Al-Jami’ li Ahkam al-Quran, 6/291) 
Companions’ views on playing chess
With regard to the views of the Companions, it was narrated that ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) passed by some people who were playing chess. He said, “What are these images, to which you are devoted? [cf. al-Anbiya 21:52]” Imam Ahmad said: “The soundest comment on chess was that which was said by ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him).” 
‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) was asked about chess and he said, “It is worse than dice.” 
“Dice” refers to what is used nowadays for playing backgammon , which is played on a special table. It was narrated in the hadiths that it is haram.  
Abu Dawud (4938) narrated from Abu Musa al-Ash’ari that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever plays dice has disobeyed Allah and His Messenger.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 4129) 
Muslim (2260) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever plays dice is like one who has dipped his hand in the flesh and blood of a pig.” Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “This hadith is quoted as evidence by al-Shafi`i and the majority of scholars to prove that playing dice is haram. The phrase ‘dipped his hand in the flesh and blood of a pig’ refers to eating it, and this simile is used to show that this is haram because it is haram to eat that.” 
Scholars’ views on playing chess
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Chess is like dice in that it is forbidden.” (al-Mughni, 14/155), 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“The evil consequences of chess are greater than the evil consequences of dice. Everything that points to the prohibition of dice points to the prohibition of chess even more so… This is the view of Malik and his companions, of Abu Hanifah and his companions, of Ahmad and his companions, and the view of the majority of the Successors… It is not known that any of the Companions permitted it or played it. Allah protected them from that. Everything that is attributed to any of them and says that he played it – such as Abu Hurayrah – is a fabrication and lie against the Companions and is rejected by anyone who knows how the Companions really were and by anyone who has sufficient knowledge to examine the reports critically. How could the best generation and the best of mankind after the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) permit playing something that prevents people from remembering Allah and from praying, and is worse in this regard than alcohol when the player gets immersed in it, as we see in real life? How could the Lawgiver forbid dice but permit chess, which is many times worse?…” (Al-Furusiyyah, 303, 305, 311)
Al-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“With regard to chess, most of the scholars say that it is haram to play it, whether that is for money or not. If it is played for money then it is indisputably gambling. Even if it is not played for money it is still gambling and haram, according to most of the scholars… al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about playing chess, is it forbidden or permissible? He (may Allah have mercy on him) replied that if it makes a person miss praying on time or he plays for money, then it is haram, otherwise it is makruh according to al-Shafi’i and haram according to others…” (Al-Kabair, 89-90)

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“There is nothing like Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer” [Ash-Shura 42:11]
So nothing in His creation resembles Him , but a person may see in his dream that his Lord is speaking to him, but whatever images he sees is not Allah because there is nothing like unto Allah, so there is nothing that resembles Him. 
Shaykh Taqiy Ad-Din (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning this that it may vary according to the situation of the person who sees it. The more righteous and good the person is, the closer his dream will be to what is true and correct, but Allah is different from whatever he sees, because the basic principle is that there is nothing like unto Allah. 
He may hear a voice that says such and such or do such and such, without seeing any image that resembles any created being, because there is nothing like unto Allah. It was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw his Lord in a dream. It was narrated from Mu`adh (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw his Lord, and it was narrated via a number of chains of narrations that he saw his Lord, and that Allah put His hand between the Prophet’s shoulders so that he felt its coolness on his chest. Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) wrote an essay on that which he entitled Ikhtiyar Al-Awla fi Sharh Hadith Ikhtisam Al-Mala’ Al-A`la. This indicates that the Prophets saw the Lord in his dreams. But as for seeing the Lord in this world with their eyes , that did not happen. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that no one will see his Lord until he dies . This was narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh. When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked whether he had seen his Lord, he said: “I saw Light.” This was narrated by Muslim from Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him).  
`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) was asked about that and she said that no one will see Him in this world, because seeing Allah in Paradise is the greatest blessing for the Muslims , so that will happen only to the people of Paradise and the believers in the Hereafter, and to the believers in the place of standing on the Day of Resurrection. This world is the abode of trial and testing, the place shared by both good and evil people, so it is not the place for seeing Allah, for seeing Him is the greatest blessing , so Allah has saved it for His believing slaves in the abode of honour on the Day of Resurrection.  
With regard to seeing Allah in a dream as  many people claim to have done, that varies according to the situation of the one who saw that – as Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said – how righteous and pious the person is.
 Some people may imagine that they have seen Allah when that is not the case, for the Shaytan may appear to them and make them think that he is their Lord, as it was narrated that he appeared to `Abd Al-Qadir Al-Jilani on a throne above the water, and said, “I am your lord and I have relieved you of obligations.” Shaykh `Abd Al-Qadir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Shut up, O enemy of Allah, you are not my Lord, because the commands of my Lord can never be lifted from those who are accountable.” Or words to that effect.  
The point is that seeing Allah when awake cannot happen to anyone in this world , not even the Prophets (peace be upon them), as stated above in the Hadith of Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him). This is also indicated by the words of Allah to Musa (peace be upon him) when he asked his Lord to let him see Him. He said to him (interpretation of the meaning): 
“You cannot see Me.” [Al-A`raf 7:143]
But the Prophets and some of the righteous may see Him in a dream in a manner that does not resemble any of His creation, as stated above in the Hadith of Mu`adh (may Allah be pleased with him). However, if there is a command to do something that goes against Shari`ah, this is a sign that he has not seen his Lord, rather he has seen a devil. If he sees that he is telling him, Do not pray for you have been relieved of obligations, or you do not have to pay Zakah, or you do not have to fast Ramadan, or you do not have to honour parents, or he says it does not matter if you consume Riba (usury, interest) – all such things are signs that he has seen a devil and has not seen his Lord. With regard to the reports of Imam Ahmad seeing his Lord, I do not know if they are sound or not. It was said that he saw his Lord but I do not know if that is true.

    is riba. The scholars are unanimously agreed that this haraam transaction is both riba al-nasee’ah and riba al-fadl combined, because it involves 
    exchanging currency available immediately for currency of the same kind to be paid later, plus an extra amount. 
If currency is exchanged for currency of a 
    different kind, the physical exchange must be done in the same sitting where the agreement is made. If they are of the same kind, then they must 
    be equal in value and the physical exchange must be done in the same sitting where the agreement is made. This is not the case in this scenario;
