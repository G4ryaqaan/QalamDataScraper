60407,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60407,Is it permissible to delay payment of salaries to employees?,"I work in a company as an accountant, and all the financial transactions and cheques pass through me. The owner of the company pays zakaah but he delays payment of salaries to employees by three months. Is that permissible?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It is not permissible to delay payment of salaries to 
    employees beyond the time when they are due, which is when the work is 
    completed or at the end of the agreed-upon period. If the agreement is that 
    the salary be paid monthly, then it must be paid to the worker at the end of 
    each month; delaying it with no excuse is regarded as unfair and unjust. 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Then if they give suck to the children for you, give them 
    their due payment”

    [al-Talaaq 65:6]

    So Allaah commanded that they be given their payment as soon 
    as the work is done.  

    Ibn Maajah (2443) narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Give the worker his wages before his 
    sweat dries.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. 
What this means to 
    hastening to give him his dues as soon as the work is done. Similarly, when 
    the agreed-upon period ends (which is one month in the case of most 
    employees nowadays), then it is obligatory to hasten to give him his dues. 

    Al-Manaawi said in Fayd al-Qadeer: 

    It is haraam to delay and postpone when one is able to pay. 
    The command to give it to him before his sweat dries is a metaphor for the 
    obligation to pay him as soon as the job is done, even if he does not sweat, 
    or if he sweated and it has dried. End quote. 

    The company owner’s delay in paying the salaries is 
    wrongdoing which makes his honour and punishment permissible, as the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Withholding of 
    payment by a rich man is wrongdoing.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (2400), Muslim 
    (1564). 

    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “If one who can afford it delays payment, his honour and 
    punishment become permissible.” Narrated by Abu Dawood (3682), al-Nasaa’i 
    (4689) and Ibn Maajah (2427), classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Irwa’ 
    al-Ghaleel, 1434. 
What is meant by his 
    honour becoming permissible is that one may say, “So and so delayed paying 
    me and he wronged me.” Punishing him means detaining him. This is how it was 
    interpreted by Sufyaan and others. 

    The Standing Committee was asked about a boss who did not 
    give his workers their salaries until they traveled to their homelands once 
    every year or two, and the workers agreed to that because they have no 
    choice, job opportunities are few, and they need the money. 

    They replied: What this boss should do is to give his workers 
    their salaries at the end of every month, as is the custom among people 
    nowadays. But if there is an agreement and they accept that the salary will 
    be paid all together after one or two years, there is nothing wrong with 
    that, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said in a saheeh hadeeth: “The Muslims are bound by their conditions.” End 
    quote. 

    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 
    14/390 
Based on the above, you 
    should advise the company owner and explain to him that it is haraam to 
    delay the employees’ salaries and it is haraam to harm them.

60412,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60412,What is meant by the beginning of the time for prayer,"I am a young woman and I experience discharges all the time. I used to pray and read Qur’aan until the time for the next obligatory prayer came, then I read a fatwa which said that a woman can read Qur’aan and pray naafil prayers but this should be at the beginning of the time until the time for the next prayer begins. We know that the beginning of the time is when the muezzin gives the call to prayer, but when is the beginning of the time for the next prayer – is it one quarter of an hour before the adhaan or less?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    Continuous discharge comes under the heading of continual 
    impurity; it is like istihaadah (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding), urinary 
    incontinence or continual passing of wind. The one who is affected by this 
    discharges has to do wudoo’ at the time of every prayer, then pray as much 
    as she wants of naafil prayers, and she may touch the Mus-haf with that 
    wudoo’, until the time for the next prayer begins. 

    With regard to reciting Qur’aan without touching the Mus-haf, 
    wudoo’ is not required for that. The person who is impure in the sense of 
    minor impurity may recite Qur’aan by heart, or recite from the Mus’haf if he 
    holds it with a barrier such as gloves and the like. For the ruling on 
    discharges please see question no. 
    50404. 

    Secondly: 

    What is meant by the beginning of the time is the time when 
    the adhaan is given for the prayer, according to the timing in each land. 

    Islam has stipulated the timings for the beginning and end of 
    each prayer. You will find details of this in the answer to question no.
    9940. 

    If the time for ‘Asr, for example, starts at 3 p.m., then 
    when the woman who is experiencing discharges does wudoo’ for Zuhr, she may 
    touch the Mus-haf, circumambulate the Ka’bah and offer as many naafil 
    prayers as she wants until 3 p.m., when the adhaan is given for ‘Asr prayer, 
    so long as she does not break her wudoo’ in any other way apart from 
    discharges during that time, such as by urinating and other things that are 
    known to break wudoo’, because she is only excused for the discharge because 
    it is continuous and it is hard to stop it.

60420,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60420,"The time for the evening adhkaar, and is there any overlap between the adhkaar of prayer and the adhkaar of morning and evening?","I want to ask about the evening adkhaar. Should they all be said in the time between ‘Asr prayer and Maghrib, or it is true that Ayat al-Kurisy, al-Ikhlaas and al-Mi’wadhatayn should be said after the adhaan and “Hasbi Allaah alladhi laa illaha illa huwa ‘alayhi tawwakaltu wa huwa rabb al-‘arsh il-‘azeem (Sufficient for me is Allaah, besides Whom there is no other god; in Him have I put my trust and He is the Lord of the mighty Throne)” after praying Maghrib?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The scholars differed concerning the time for the evening adhkaar. Some of them said that that it is between ‘Asr and Maghrib; some said that it is when the sun passes the zenith (which is when the time for Zuhr begins) until the sun sets, and the first part of the night; and some said that it is from when the sun passes its zenith until halfway through the night. 
The first view was held by Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him). In al-Waabil al-Sayyib (p.127) he said: Concerning the two ends of the day, which are the period between dawn and sunrise and the period between ‘Asr and Maghrib. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Remember Allaah with much remembrance
42. And glorify His Praises morning and afternoon [the early morning (Fajr) and ‘Asr prayers]”
[al-Ahzaab 33:41-42]
With regard to the word aseel (translated here as afternoon), al-Jawhari said: it is the time after ‘Asr, until sunset. 
And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and glorify the praises of your Lord in the ‘Ashi (i.e. the time period after the midnoon till sunset) and in the Ibkaar (i.e. the time period from early morning or sunrise till before midnoon)”
[Ghaafir 40:55]
Ibkaar means the beginning of the day, and ‘ashi means the end of it. 
And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and glorify the Praises of your Lord, before the rising of the sun and before (its) setting”
[Qaaf 50:39]
This is the explanation of what is mentioned in the hadeeth of the one who said such and such in the morning and in the afternoon; what is meant is before the sun rises and before it sets, so the time for these adhkaar is after Fajr and after ‘Asr. 
The second view was held by some of the scholars and was stated in a fatwa issued by the Standing Committee, when they were asked: Should the evening adhkaar be after ‘Asr or after the sun sets or after Maghrib prayer?
They replied: The evening adhkaar begin after the sun passes its zenith, until it sets, and at the beginning of the night. The morning adhkaar begin from when dawn breaks until the sun passes the zenith. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and glorify the praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun, and before its setting”
[Ta-Ha 20:130] 
“And remember your Lord within yourself, humbly and with fear and without loudness in words in the mornings and in the afternoons [asaal]”
[al-A’raaf 7:205]
The word asaal (translated here as “afternoons”) refers to the period between ‘Asr and Maghrib.  
And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So glorify Allaah [above all that (evil) they associate with Him (O believers)], when you come up to the evening [i.e. offer the (Maghrib) sunset and (‘Ishaa’) night prayers], and when you enter the morning [i.e. offer the (Fajr) morning prayer].
18. And His are all the praises and thanks in the heavens and the earth; and (glorify Him) in the afternoon (i.e. offer ‘Asr prayer) and when you come up to the time, when the day begins to decline (i.e. offer Zuhr prayer)”
[al-Room 30:18]
end quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (24/178) 
The third view was held by al-Suyooti (may Allaah have mercy on him) as was quoted from him by Ibn ‘Allaan in al-Futoohaat al-Rabbaaniyyah ‘ala al-Adhkaar al-Nawaawiyyah (3/73). 
Thus it is also clear that there is a difference of opinion concerning the time for the morning adhkaar – it is the time between dawn and sunrise, or until the sun reaches its zenith? 
There are a number of opinions on this matter, but we have limited ourselves to those which are most well known. 
Secondly: 
The saheeh Sunnah indicates that Ayat al-Kurisy should be recited among the adhkaar of morning and evening. That was narrated by al-Nasaa’i in ‘Aml al-Yawm wa’l-Laylah and al-Tabaraani in al-Kabeer from Ubayy ibn Ka’b (may Allaah hbe pleased with him), who said that he had a pile of dates from which some were disappearing, so he guarded it one night and he saw a beast that resembled a grown boy. He greeted him and he returned the greeting, and said: “What are you, a jinni or a human?” He said: “A jinni.” He said: “Stretch out your hand to me.” So he stretched out his hand and he saw that it was the paw of a dog with the hair of a dog. He said: “Is this the form of the jinn?” He said: “The jinn know that there is no man among them who is stronger than me.” He said: “What brought you here?” He said: “We heard that you love to give charity so we came for a share of your food.” He said: “What will protect us from you?” He said: “This verse that is in soorat al-Baqarah: ‘Allaah! Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), Al-Hayyul-Qayyoom (the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists)…’ [al-Baqarah 2:255]. Whoever recites it in the evening will be protected from us until morning, and whoever recites it in the morning will be protected from us until the evening.” The next morning he came to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and mentioned that to him, and he said: “The evil one spoke the truth.” This isnaad of this hadeeth was classed as jayyid by al-Mundhiri in al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb, and was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb (662). 
The Sunnah also indicates that al-Mi’wadhatayn (i.e., the last two soorahs of the Qur’aan) are part of the adhkaar for morning and evening. Abu Dawood (5082), al-Tirmidhi (3575) and al-Nasaa’i (5428) narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Khubayb that he said: We set out on a very rainy and dark night, looking for the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to lead us in prayer. We caught up with him and he said: “Did you pray?” I did not say anything, and he said, “Say something,” but I did not say anything. He said, “Say something,” but I did not say anything. He said: “Say something,” and I said: “O Messenger of Allaah, what should I say?” He said: “Say: ‘Qul huwa Allaahu ahad (Soorah 112) and al-Mi’wadhatayn in the evening and in the morning, three times, and that will suffice you against everything.” This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
With regard to reciting the verse of repentance, there is a report narrated by Ibn al-Sunni in ‘Aml al-Yawm wa’l-Laylah (21) from Abu’l-Darda’ (may Allaah be pleased with him), from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) who said: “Whoever says every day, in the morning and the evening, Hasbi Allaah alladhi laa illaha illa huwa ‘alayhi tawwakaltu wa huwa rabb al-‘arsh il-‘azeem (Sufficient for me is Allaah, besides Whom there is no other god; in Him have I put my trust and He is the Lord of the mighty Throne), seven times, Allaah will suffice him with regard to what he is worried about, in this world and in the Hereafter.” This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by Shu’ayb al-Arna’oot in Tahqeeq Zaad al-Ma’aad (2/342). 
Thirdly: 
The ahaadeeth quoted above indicate that there is no difference between these adhkaar; all of them may be said in the morning and in the evening. It is not correct to say that some of them should be said after the adhaan and some should be said after Maghrib prayer. 
But based on the three well-known scholarly opinions on the time for the evening adhkaar, which we mentioned above, the one who says them between ‘Asr and Maghrib has said the adhkaar at the right time. As for reciting them after the adhaan or Maghrib or after Maghrib prayer, this is in accordance with the view that the time for them extends until Maghrib or until halfway through the night, as stated above. 
Fourthly: 
There may be some overlap between the adhkaar of prayer and the adhkaar for morning and evening. The Sunnah indicates that Ayat al-Kursiy and al-Mi’wadhatayn are among the adhkaar which it is prescribed to recite following the prayers. Al-Nasaa’i narrated that Abu Umaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever recites Ayat al-Kurisy after every prayer, nothing stands between him and entering Paradise except death.” This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb (1595).
Abu Dawood (1523), al-Nasaa’i (1336) and al-Tirmidhi (2903) narrated that ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told me to recite al-Mu’awwidhaat after every prayer.” This was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
So whoever recites that after Fajr prayer. This will suffice for the adhkaar of prayer and the morning adhkaar, but he should recite al-Mu’awwidhaat three times, as mentioned above in the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Khubayb. 
Whoever recites that after ‘Asr prayer, or after Maghrib prayer – according to the view that the time for the evening adhkaar lasts until then – that will suffice for the adhkaar of prayer and the evening adhkaar.

I sent one of my relatives to a religious man to ask him how I could find this book. He told me to bring a child of 11 or 12 years of age and give him an egg on which was written something in blue, and he covered the child with a head-cloth and recited some Quran, then he asked the child whether he could see the one who had taken the book. The child told us of the description and name of a person we know very well but whom the child does not know. What is the ruling on that?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    The saheeh ahadeeth (authentic narrations) indicate that it 
    is haram (impermissible) to go to fortune-tellers and soothsayers, and to 
    ask them questions and believe them. For example, the Prophet (peace and 
    blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever goes to a fortune-teller and 
    asks him about something, his prayer will not be accepted for forty days.” 
    [Muslim].

    And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 
    “Whoever has intercourse with a menstruating woman or with a woman in her 
    back passage, or goes to a fortune-teller and believes him, has disbelieved 
    in what Allah revealed to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon 
    him).” [Ahmad, Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Maajah]. 

    Al-Baghawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The 
    fortune-teller is the one who claims to have knowledge of things by means of 
    certain practices which will lead him to know where stolen and lost items 
    are, etc. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The 
    fortune-teller (al-‘arraf): it was said that this refers to the soothsayer 
    (al-kahin), who is the one who foretells the future. 

    And it was said that this is a general term which includes 
    soothsayers, astrologers, geomancers and the like, who claim to have 
    knowledge of the unseen by means of certain practices that they use. This is 
    a more general meaning and is indicated by the derivation of the word, which 
    is derived from m’arifah (knowledge), so it applies to all those who deal 
    with these things and claim to have knowledge of them. Trying to find out 
    the identity of the thief in the manner described is a kind of soothsaying 
    and fortune-telling which is haram, as it relies on using the services of 
    the jinn and trusting them. You should not be deceived by the fact that the 
    fortune-teller recites the Quran, because this is just a trick that these 
    followers of falsehood use. 

    See question no. 
    
    21124 for information on the signs of witches (practitioners of 
    witchcraft), fortune-tellers and soothsayers. 

    Secondly: 

    Some scholars are of the view that the one who claims to have 
    knowledge of stolen things, or who claims that the jinn will tell him about 
    them is a kafir (disbeliever). Ibn Nujaym (may Allah have mercy on him) said 
    in Bayan al-Mukaffirat: Going to a soothsayer and believing him when he 
    says, I know where stolen things are, and what I say is based on what the 
    jinn tell me. And he is guilty of kufr (disbelief) by saying, what I say is 
    based on what the jinn tell me, because the jinn, like humans, do not have 
    knowledge of the unseen, as Allah says of them (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “So when he fell down, the jinn saw clearly that if they had 
    known the unseen, they would not have stayed in the humiliating torment.” 
    [34:14] 

    With regard to going to a fortune-teller and asking him 
    something, this is subject to further discussion. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
    Asking fortune-tellers and the like falls into different categories:  

    1 – Merely asking him a question. This is haram because the 
    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever goes to a 
    fortune-teller and asks him something, his prayer will not be accepted for 
    forty days.” The fact that he will be punished for asking him indicates that 
    it is haram, because there is no punishment except for doing something 
    haram. 

    2 – Asking him and believing him and accepting what he says. 
    This is kufr, because believing him with regard to knowledge of the unseen 
    represents disbelief in the Quran, where Allah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “Say: None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib 
    (unseen) except Allah.” [27:65] 

    3 – Asking him in order to test him and find out whether he 
    is telling the truth or lying, not in order to accept what he says.  There 
    is nothing wrong with this. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be 
    upon him) asked Ibn Sayyad: “What am I hiding from you?” He said: al-Dukh. 
    He said: “Be quiet! You can never go beyond your station.” 

    The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked 
    him about something that he was thinking of in order to test him, and he 
    told him of it. 

    4 – Asking him in order to demonstrate his inability and 
    lies, so he tests him about some things. This may be obligatory or required.
    

    The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas 
    were asked: Sometimes we lose some money or gold in the house, and we think 
    that it has been stolen. So we got to one of the people (a “mukhbir”) and we 
    tell him the story and explain that to him, and he promises to help us. 
    Sometimes we get the lost item back and sometimes we do not. What is the 
    ruling on our going to these people? 

    They replied: It is not permissible to go to him because he 
    is a soothsayer, and it is narrated in saheeh (authentic) reports that the 
    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade going to 
    soothsayers and the like and asking them questions and believing them. End 
    quote. 

    They were also asked: You said in the previous question that 
    going to a “mukhbir” is not permissible because he is a soothsayer. I would 
    like to point out here that the people to whom we go are known for their 
    adherence to the teachings of Islam. They do not recite anything except the 
    Quran and hadeeth (prophetic narrations) with regard to matters such as 
    those that I have mentioned in my question. What is the ruling on our going 
    to them? 

    They replied: Simply reciting the Quran and hadeeth will not 
    show them where the lost item is or bring it back. Whoever goes to someone 
    who claims to know where lost items are just by reading the Quran and 
    ahadeeth is going to a soothsayer and charlatan, even if he claims to be 
    righteous and religious. He may make an outward show of reciting the Quran 
    and hadeeth in order to mislead and deceive, but inwardly they are 
    soothsayers and fortune-tellers. End quote. 

    Thirdly: 

    The one who goes to the fortune-teller and asks him something 
    has to repent to Allah and regret what he has done, and resolve not to do it 
    again. He should not accuse anyone of stealing on the basis of what the 
    fortune-teller and his helpers among the jinn say, because the jinn tell 
    lies. They may accuse an innocent person in order to spread corruption among 
    the Muslims. Repentance in this case is required from the one who went to 
    the fortune-teller and asked him, and it is also required from the one who 
    told him to do so, because they have all fallen into sin. See question no.
    
    
    32863 with regard to repentance from asking fortune-tellers and 
    believing them. 

    The Muslim should beseech Allah and turn to Him when problems 
    and calamities befall him, because all things are in His hand, as he says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Is not He (better than your gods) Who responds to the 
    distressed one, when he calls on Him, and Who removes the evil, and makes 
    you inheritors of the earth, generations after generations? Is there any 
    ilah (god) with Allah? Little is that you remember!” [27:62] 

    It is not appropriate at all for a Muslim to put his 
    religious commitment at risk for the sake of finding something that he has 
    lost, because the most precious thing that the Muslim should guard is his 
    religious commitment, and he should do whatever he can to protect it as it 
    is more precious than money or anything else. And it should never be the 
    other way round, under any circumstances whatsoever.

60442,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60442,Is she sinning by attending wedding parties that involve reprehensible things if she sits far away and helps them with cooking etc?,"The wedding parties in our country include drums, singing and dancing. Is there any sin on me if I go to the party and sit far away from where the singing is taking place, especially at weddings of my husband’s family and my family, where I can’t not go and help with permissible things such as cooking etc?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    It is not permissible to attend wedding parties that include 
    reprehensible things such as singing accompanied by drums or other musical 
    instruments, apart from the daff, or mixing between men and women, or other 
    evils, except for one who is able to denounce that and thinks it most likely 
    that he will be able to put a stop to the evil by denouncing it. 

    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If a person 
    is invited to a waleemah in which there is sin, such as alcohol and musical 
    instruments, etc, and he can denounce it and put an end to the evil, then he 
    must attend and denounce it, because then he will be fulfilling two 
    obligations: accepting the invitation of his Muslim brother and putting a 
    stop to evil. But if he is unable to denounce it, then he should not attend. 
    If he does not know of the evil until he gets there, then he should put a 
    stop to it, and if he is not able to, then he should leave. Something 
    similar to this was said by al-Shaafa’i. End quote from al-Mughni, 
    7/214. 

    It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah: If the 
    wedding party is free of evils such as mixing between men and women, 
    promiscuous singing and so on, or if she attends she will be able to change 
    the evils, then it is permissible for her to attend in order to share in the 
    joy. Rather attendance is obligatory if there is some evil that she is able 
    to put a stop to. 

    But if the party involves evils that she cannot denounce, 
    then it is haraam for her to attend, because of the general meaning of the 
    verses in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And leave alone those who take their religion as play and 
    amusement, and whom the life of this world has deceived. But remind (them) 
    with it (the Qur’aan) lest a person be given up to destruction for that 
    which he has earned, when he will find for himself no protector or 
    intercessor besides Allaah”

    [al-An’aam 6:70]  

    “And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. 
    music, singing) to mislead (men) from the path of Allaah without knowledge, 
    and takes it (the path of Allaah, or the Verses of the Qur’aan) by way of 
    mockery. For such there will be a humiliating torment (in the Hell‑fire)”

    ahaadeeth which condemn singing and musical instruments. End quote from 
    Fataawa al-Mar’ah, compiled by Muhammad al-Musnad, p. 92 
Secondly: 
If your going to the 
    wedding and taking part in the cooking etc will not result in your listening 
    to the evils, or approving of them or helping in them, such as if the place 
    where the evil actions are being committed is far away from you, or you will 
    be able to leave before they start the reprehensible actions, then there is 
    nothing wrong with your going in that case, but you should offer them advice 
    and explain to them the rulings on these evils, and tell them that it is 
    haraam to take part in them. 
In his commentary on the 
    verse (interpretation of the meaning):  
“And it has already 
    been revealed to you in the Book (this Qur’aan) that when you hear the 
    Verses of Allaah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until 
    they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) 
    certainly in that case you would be like them. Surely, Allaah will collect 
    the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell”
[al-Nisa’ 4:140]
al-Qurtubi (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: “then sit not with them, until they engage in a 
    talk other than that” means, talk other than kufr; “certainly in that 
    case you would be like them”. This indicates that it is obligatory to 
    avoid those who commit sin if they openly commit an evil action, because 
    whoever does not avoid them is approving of what they are doing, and 
    approving of kufr is itself kufr. Allaah says “certainly in that case you 
    would be like them”. So whoever sits in a gathering where sin is 
    committed and does not denounce it has a burden of sin just like them. 
They should be denounced 
    if they speak of or do sinful things; if a person is not able to denounce 
    them, then he should get up and leave them, so that he will not be one of 
    those mentioned in this verse. End quote. 
Al-Sa’di (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him) said: 
This also includes 
    attending gatherings where sin and immorality take place, where the commands 
    and prohibitions of Allaah are taken lightly and the limits that He has set 
    for His slaves are transgressed. It is forbidden to sit with them “until 
    they engage in a talk other than that”, i.e., other than disbelieving in 
    the verses of Allaah and mocking them. “certainly in that case” 
    means, if you sit with them in those circumstances, “you would be like 
    them” because you have approved of their kufr and mockery of Islam, and 
    the one who approves of a sin is like the one who does it. 
To conclude, the one who 
    attends a gathering in which Allaah is disobeyed is obliged to denounce them 
    if he is able to, or to leave if he is not. End quote.

And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
60459,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60459,Is it permissible for him to lie to his parents in order to go out and seek (Islamic) knowledge?,"Allah has favoured me by islam. And I love to seek knowledge, but my parents stopped me, they are strongly against seeking Islamic knowledge. I had then to travel and seek knowledge in another city without their permission. When they ask me after I come home late, I lie to them. I spend a full day every week away from home, they think that I am studying with friends, but I am not, I lie to them a lot. 

My questions are: 

Is it permissible for me to lie to them, although I know that lying is a great sin and crime, but it is the only way for me to continue seeking knowledge? 

What shall I do if they know what I was hiding? They will, for sure, stop me seeking islamic knowledge, shall I obey them then or continue what I am doing? They may tell me to leave home if I do not stop, I am a medical student, I cannot do anything else outside to spend on myself, what shall I do?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    Seeking shar’i (Islamic) knowledge is one of the greatest 
    means of drawing closer to Allaah, and is a sign that Allaah is guiding and 
    loves His slave, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “When Allaah wills good for a person, He causes him to 
    understand the religion.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (71) and Muslim (1037). 

    This knowledge may be divided into fard ‘ayn (individual 
    obligation) and fard kifaayah (communal obligation). That which is an 
    individual obligation is that which the Muslim needs to know in order for 
    his ‘aqeedah (belief), worship and interactions with others to be sound. 

    Everything other than that is naafil or supererogatory for 
    the individual, but it is a communal obligation for the ummah as a whole. 

    The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas 
    were asked: Is studying shar’i knowledge obligatory? 

    They replied: Shar’i knowledge falls into two categories. 
    There is that which is obligatory for every Muslim, male and female, to 
    know, which is knowledge of the basics of faith, the pillars of Islam, the 
    rulings on prayer, how to do wudoo’ and purify oneself from janaabah and so 
    on. It is in this sense that the famous hadeeth, “Seeking knowledge is a 
    duty on every Muslim” is to be understood. 

    The second category is fard kifaayah (a communal obligation), 
    which is learning all aspects of Islamic knowledge, the details of various 
    cases and the evidence for them. If some people undertake this, the rest of 
    the ummah is absolved of sin. End quote. 

    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah 
    (12/90). 

    Secondly: 

    The basic principle concerning lying is that it is haraam and 
    it is only permissible in specific cases that have been explained in 
    sharee’ah, in order to attain major benefits or ward off harm. For more 
    information on these cases please see the answer to question no. 
    47564. 

    Thirdly: 

    Going out to seek knowledge without one’s parents’ permission 
    or against their wishes is something that is subject to further discussion. 

    1 – If acquiring the knowledge is an individual obligation, 
    then it is not essential to have one’s parents’ permission, and if they try 
    to stop you then you do not have to obey them with regard to that. But lying 
    is a serious matter, and equivocation or ambiguity is a safe way to avoid a 
    lie. Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his Saheeh: 
    Chapter: Equivocation or ambiguity is a safe way to avoid a lie. Ishaaq 
    said: I heard Anas (say): A son of Abu Talhah died, and he said: How is the 
    boy? Umm Sulaym said: He has calmed down, and I hope that he has found 
    relief. And he thought that she was telling the truth. 

    Equivocation or ambiguity is the opposite of clarity. What is 
    meant is saying one thing and meaning something else, or deliberate 
    ambiguity; it is a way out of lying. 

    Al-Haafiz said: The point of quoting what Umm Sulaym said, He 
    has calmed down, and I hope that he has found relief., is that Abu Talhah 
    understood from that that the sick child had recovered, because she said 
    “calmed down” in the sense of quietening down, and gave the impression that 
    he had fallen asleep. When a sick person falls asleep, it may be a sign that 
    the sickness has gone or is reduced. But what she actually meant was that 
    the child had died. This is reflected in her words, “I hope that he has 
    found relief”. He understood that the child had found relief by recovering 
    whereas she meant that he had found relief from the problems of this world 
    and the pain of sickness. She was telling the truth as far as what she meant 
    is concerned, but what she told Abu Talhah was something other than what he 
    understood. So the narrator said: He thought that she was telling the truth, 
    i.e., based on what he understood. End quote from Fath al-Baari 
    (10/594). 

    Ibn Qutaybah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: An example 
    of equivocation is what Ibraaheem al-Khaleel (peace be upon him) said 
    concerning his wife, “She is my sister,” meaning that the believers are 
    brothers and sisters of one another. End quote from Ta’weel Mukhtalif 
    al-Hadeeth, p. 35. 

    If you are asked why you are late, for example, you can say 
    that you were studying with a friend, and they will think that you mean you 
    were studying medicine, when in fact you mean that you were studying Islam. 
    Or you can say that you were with a classmate, meaning a fellow student of 
    Islam, or that you passed by your friend, meaning on your way back from the 
    Islamic class. This ambiguity is only to be used when necessary and you 
    should not do it a great deal when there is no need for it, because that may 
    lead to lying, loss of respect and loss of trust in what a person says. 

    The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas 
    were asked: It is essential to have parents’ permission for seeking 
    knowledge that is obligatory, or not?  

    They replied: Seeking knowledge on which the validity of your 
    faith and performance of obligatory duties depend does not require parents’ 
    permission, but when it comes to knowledge that is a communal obligation, 
    then parents’ permission should be sought. End quote. 

    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah 
    (12/78).

     2 – If the parents do not let you attend religious study 
    circles because they dislike your seeking Islamic knowledge, then you should 
    not ask their permission and you are not obliged to obey them in that case. 
    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: … But if he knows 
    that his parents dislike him seeking Islamic knowledge, then he should not 
    obey them, and he should not ask them for permission if he goes out, because 
    their motive is dislike of Islamic knowledge. See his comments in full in 
    the answer to question no. 11558. 

    3 – If going out to seek knowledge requires travel and being 
    absent from them when they need you to help them and so on, then you must 
    ask their permission. But if seeking knowledge is in the same city where you 
    live, and they do not need you during the period when you are outside the 
    home, then their permission is not essential. 

    Al-Khallaal narrated that a man asked Ahmad (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him): I am seeking knowledge, but my mother has told me not to do 
    that; she wants me to work in trade. He said to me: Be kind to her and say 
    something pleasing to her, but do not stop seeking knowledge. 

    Ibn Muflih said in al-Adaab al-Shar’iyyah (1/646): The 
    author of al-Nuzum said: Do not obey them in forsaking a confirmed 
    naafil action such as seeking knowledge that will not harm them. End quote. 

    Fourthly:  

    You should note that there are many ways of acquiring 
    knowledge, especially nowadays when tapes, CDs and books are widely 
    available. For example: 

    1-You can make use of books, 
    tapes and information available on the internet.

    2-You can make use of the 
    programs on some satellite channels such as beneficial lessons which are 
    presented on the educational Majd  channel.

    3-You can read books and ask 
    knowledgeable people via the internet or through other means, about things 
    you are confused about.

    We ask Allaah to help and guide you.
