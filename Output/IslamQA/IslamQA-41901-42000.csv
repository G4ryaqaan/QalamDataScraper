Can I fast the first ten days of Dhu’l-Hijjah?","Whoever fasts on the day of `Arafah or `Ashura, and still owes some days from Ramadan, his fast is valid. But if he has the intention of fasting this day to make up for a missed Ramadan fast, he will have two rewards – one for the day of `Arafah or `Ashura and another for making up the missed fast.",,"Praise be to Allah.This issue is known to the scholars as observing nafll fasts before making up missed Ramadan fasts . There is a difference of scholarly opinion concerning this matter. Some scholars say that it is haram to observe nafll fasts before making up days that one owes, because it is more important to start with an obligatory action than a nafll one. Some of the scholars say that it is permissible. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about combining making up a missed obligation and doing something that is mustahabb: is it permissible for a person to do the mustahabb action and make up the obligatory action later on, or should he do the obligatory action first, such as fasting the day `Ashura which coincides with making up a missed Ramadan fast? 
He replied:
“With regard to obligatory and voluntary fasts, what is prescribed in the Shari`ah and what makes sense is to start with the obligatory fasts and then do the nafll ones, because the obligatory fast is a debt which must be paid, whereas the nafll fast is voluntary and is to be done if one can manage it, otherwise there is no sin on one. Based on this, we say to the one who owes a missed Ramadan fast: make up what you owe before you observe a voluntary fast. If he observes a voluntary fast before making up what he owes then the correct view is that his voluntary fast is valid so long as there is still enough time to make up the missed fasts, because a person may make up missed Ramadan fasts so long as there is still enough time for him to do so before the next Ramadan comes. So long as there is still plenty of time, it is permissible for him to observe voluntary fasts. This is similar to the case of obligatory prayers, such as if a person offers a nafll prayer before an obligatory prayer when there is still plenty of time, this is permissible. Whoever fasts on the day of `Arafah or `Ashura , and still owes some days from Ramadan, his fast is valid. But if he has the intention of fasting this day to make up for a missed Ramadan fast, he will have two rewards – one for the day of `Arafah or `Ashura and another for making up the missed fast. This applies to all voluntary fasts that are not connected to Ramadan. With regard to fasting the six days of Shawwal, these are connected to Ramadan and can only be done after making up missed Ramadan fasts. If a person fasts these days before making up his missed Ramadan fasts, he will not get the reward for them, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever fasts Ramadan then follows it with six days of Shawwal , it will be as if he fasted for a lifetime.” It is known that the one who still has some days to make up is not regarded as having fasted Ramadan until he makes up those days. Some people think that if they fear Shawwal is going to end soon and they fast the six days even though they still owe some days from Ramadan, that this is acceptable. This is a mistake, because these six days cannot be fasted until a person has made up the days that he owes from Ramadan.” (Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 20/438) 
Based on this, it is permissible for you to fast the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah as a nafll fast, but it is better for you to fast them with the intention of making up what you owe of Ramadan, and you will have two rewards in sha Allah.

41936,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41936,Ruling on using the name ‘Abd al-Ilaah,What is the ruling on using the name ‘Abd al-Ilaah? Is this (al-Ilaah = the God) one of the names and attributes of Allaah? I hope you will give a detailed answer.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: One of the things that is liked in giving names is to choose a name that indicates servitude to Allaah i.e., ‘Abd [slave] plus one of the names of Allaah, whether that is ‘Abd-Allaah [slave of Allaah] or the word ‘Abd plus any of the beautiful names of Allaah. The most beloved of such names to Allaah are the names ‘Abd-Allaah and ‘Abd al-Rahmaan (slave of the Most Merciful]. 
Secondly: It is haraam to give such names that indicate servitude to anyone or anything other than Allaah, such as ‘Abd al-Rasool [slave of the Messenger] or ‘Abd al-Nabi (slave of the Prophet] and so on. See also the answer to question no. 7180. 
Thirdly: al-Ilaah in Arabic means “the One Who is worshipped” or “the One Who deserves to be adored and worshipped”. The idols were called aalihah (gods) because the mushrikeen worshipped them instead of Allaah, and claimed that they were deserving of that. See Ishtiqaaq Asma’ Allaah by Abu’l-Qaasim al-Zujaaji, p. 30; Lisaan al-‘Arab, entry for aliha. Some scholars said that the word “Allaah” is derived from the word “al-Ilaah” (the God). This is the view favoured by Ibn al-Qayyim and other scholars, and the initial alif of the word ilaah was elided. 
Fourthly: is al-Ilaah one of the names of Allaah, and is it permissible to use it in a name signifying servitude to Him, or not?  
The name al-Ilaah is included among the beautiful names of Allaah which are listed in some versions of the hadeeth, “Allaah has ninety-nine names…”, as we see it narrated by al-Bayhaqi in al-Asma’ wa’l-Sifaat, and by al-Haakim. But the list of names in this hadeeth is not the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), according to the scholars who are well-versed in hadeeth, as was mentioned by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, Ibn Katheer, Ibn Hajar and other scholars. See Asma’ Allaah al-Husna by ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Saalih al-Ghusn, p. 170-173 
Because the reports which list the names of Allaah are not reliable, many scholars have tried to find these names in the Qur’aan and Sunnah. Among those who included the name al-Ilaah in their lists of the beautiful names of Allaah are: Ibn Mandah, Ibn Hazm, Ibn Hajar, Ibn al-Wazeer and Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on them). See op. cit., 352. 
Based on that, it is permissible to use the name 'Abd al-Ilah, and there is nothing wrong with that, in sha Allah. However, it seems that this name was not known in the past.""
We do not find this name among the Sahaabah, based on what we see in al-Isaabah by Ibn Hajar. We do not find it among the names mentioned in biographies by various authors, such as Fahaaris al-Siyar by al-Dhahabi, Tabaqaat al-Shaafa’iyyah by Ibn al-Subki, Wafiyaat by Ibn Khalkaan, al-Tahdheeb by Ibn Hajar, and others. The first usage of this name that we have come across is ‘Abd al-Ilaah ibn ‘Ali ibn al-Husayn al-Haashimi, who was born in 1331 AH and died in 1377, as mentioned by al-Zarkali in al-A’laam. This is obviously very recent.",Islam Q&A
41949,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41949,"The status of Hajj in Islam, and the conditions of it being obligatory",What is the status of Hajj in Islam? And for whom is it obligatory?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Hajj to the sacred House of Allah is one of the pillars of Islam and one of its most important fundamentals, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Islam is built on five (pillars): the testimony that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, establishing regular prayer, paying zakaah, fasting Ramadaan and performing pilgrimage to the sacred House of Allah.”  
It is obligatory according to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and according to the consensus of the Muslims. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence) ; and whoever disbelieves [i.e. denies Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah), then he is a disbeliever of Allah], then Allah stands not in need of any of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists)”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:97]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has enjoined the Hajj upon you, so perform Hajj.” And the Muslims are unanimously agreed upon that. It is something that no Muslim has any excuse for not knowing. Whoever denies that it is obligatory and he is one of those who live among the Muslims, is a kaafir. A person who fails to do it out of negligence is in grave danger, because some of the scholars said that such a person is a kaafir. This view is narrated in one report from Ahmad, but the correct view is that neglecting deeds does not make a person kaafir except in the case of prayer. ‘Abd-Allah ibn Shaqeeq (may Allah have mercy on him) – who was one of the Taabi’een – said: “The companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not regard omitting any action as kufr except prayer.” The one who neglects to do Hajj until he dies is not a kaafir according to the correct view, but he is in grave danger. 
The Muslim has to fear Allah and hasten to perform Hajj once he meets the conditions of it being obligatory, because we must hasten to perform all obligatory duties unless there is evidence to the contrary. How can a Muslim accept to forsake going to Hajj to the sacred House of Allah when he is able to do it and it is easy for him to get there? How can he delay it when he does not know whether he will be able to get there after this year? He may become unable to go after he was able, or he may become poor after being rich, or he may die when Hajj was obligatory for him, then his heirs may neglect to make it up on his behalf. 
The conditions of Hajj being obligatory are five: 
1 –  Being Muslim, the opposite of which is being a kaafir. The kaafir is not obliged to do Hajj, rather if a kaafir were to do Hajj, it would not be accepted from him. 
2 – Being an adult. If a person has not yet reached the age of puberty, Hajj is not obligatory for him. If he does Hajj it is valid and counts as a voluntary Hajj, and when he reaches adulthood he must do the obligatory Hajj, because Hajj before puberty does not fulfil the obligation. 
3 – Being of sound mind, the opposite of which is insanity. The one who is insane is not obliged to do Hajj, and Hajj cannot be done on his behalf. 
4 – Being free. A slave is not obliged to perform Hajj, but if he does Hajj it is valid and counts as a voluntary Hajj. If he is set free, it is obligatory for him to perform the obligatory Hajj, because Hajj done before being set free does not fulfil the obligation. Some of the scholars said that if a slave performs Hajj with the permission of his master, this is valid and he does not have to repeat it. This view is more correct. 
5 – Being able, financially and physically. In the case of a woman, this includes having a mahram. If she does not have a mahram, then she is not obliged to do Hajj. End quote.","Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 21/9-11"

    If it is the obligatory Hajj then it is not essential to have 
    their approval or permission. Rather if they try to stop him going to Hajj 
    and it is the obligatory Hajj, then he has to go for Hajj and not obey them, 
    because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

    “But if they (both) strive with you 
    to make you join in worship with Me others that of which you have no 
    knowledge, then obey them not; but behave with them in the world kindly”

    [Luqmaan 31:15]

    And the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no obedience to 
    any created being if that involves disobedience towards the Creator.”

     But if it is a naafil Hajj, then he should look at what is 
    better. If his father and mother cannot do without him and cannot bear his 
    absence, then it is better for him to stay with them, because a man asked 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) for permission 
    to go for jihad and he said to him: “Are your parents alive?” He said: 
    “Yes.” He said: “Then your jihad is with them.” So in the case of the

    should see what is better. End quote.","Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 21/68"

Can women go to Hajj without a mahram?


Should the wife ask for her husband’s permission to go to Hajj?","Praise be to Allah.Conditions of Obligation of Hajj
The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) have stated the conditions of Hajj being obligatory , which, if they are met, make it obligatory for a person to perform Hajj, and without them Hajj is not obligatory. 
There are five such conditions: being Muslim, being of sound mind, being an adult, being free and being able to do it. 
Being Muslim 
This applies to all acts of worship, because worship done by a disbeliever is not valid. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And nothing prevents their contributions from being accepted from them except that they disbelieved in Allah and in His Messenger.” [al-Tawbah 9:54]
According to the hadith of Mu’adh, when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent him to Yemen, he said: “You are going to people from among the people of the Book. Call them to bear witness that there is no god but Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah. If they obey you in that, then tell them that Allah has enjoined on them five prayers each day and night. If they obey you in that, then tell them that Allah has enjoined on them charity (zakah) to be taken from their rich and given to their poor.” (Agreed upon)
So the disbeliever is commanded first of all to enter Islam. If he becomes Muslim, then we tell him to pray, give zakah, fast, perform Hajj and all the other duties of Islam. 
Being of sound mind and being an adult 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The pen is lifted from three [and does not record their deeds]: from one who is sleeping, until he wakes up; from a child until he reaches puberty, and from one who is insane until he comes to his senses.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4403; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud) 
So a child is not obliged to perform Hajj, but if his parents take him for Hajj, his Hajj is valid; the child will have the reward of Hajj and his parents will also have a reward. When a woman lifted up a child and asked, “Is there Hajj for this one?” the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Yes, and you will have the reward.” (Narrated by Muslim)
Being free 
Hajj is not obligatory for a slave, because he is distracted by his duties towards his master.
Being able to do it 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence).” [Aal 'Imran 3:97]
This includes being able both physically and financially. 
What is meant by being physically able is that one is sound in body and can bear the hardship of travelling to the sacred House of Allah. 
Meaning of financial ability in Hajj
Being financially able means that one has enough funds to get to the sacred House of Allah and back again. 
The Standing Committee said (11/30): 
“Being able to do Hajj means that one is sound in body and has means of transportation to reach the sacred House of Allah whether by plane, car or riding animal, or by renting such means, according to his situation, and that he has sufficient provisions to get there and back. That should be surplus to what he needs to spend on those on whom he is obliged to spend, until he returns from Hajj. A woman should also have a husband or mahram with whom to travel to Hajj or ‘Umrah.”
The money that he uses to reach the sacred House should be surplus to his basic needs, the spending enjoined on him by Shari’ah, and what he needs to pay off his debts. 
What is meant by debts here is things that he owes to Allah, such as expiations, and what he owes to other people.
Hajj of one who is in debt
If a person has a debt , and he does not have enough money to both do Hajj and pay off the debt, then he should pay off the debt first and he does not have to go for Hajj. 
Some people think that the reason is that he did not ask permission from the one to whom he owes the money, and that if he gives him permission, then there is nothing wrong with it.  
There is no basis for this thinking, rather the reason is being in debt. It is known that if the lender gives the debtor permission to go for Hajj, that does not mean the debt is waived, and he will not have discharged his duty because of this permission. Hence it should be said to the debtor: Pay off your debt first, then if you have enough left, go for Hajj; otherwise Hajj is not obligatory in your case. 
If the debtor who did not go for Hajj because of his debt dies, then he will meet Allah with his Islam complete and not lacking, because Hajj was not obligatory for him, just as zakah and also Hajj are not obligatory for one who is poor. 
But if he does Hajj before paying off his debt and then dies before paying it off, then he is in danger, because even the martyr is forgiven for everything except debt, so what about anyone else? 
Meaning of spending enjoined by Shari’ah
What is meant by the spending enjoined on him by Shari’ah is what he is obliged by shari’ah to spend on himself and his family, without being either extravagant or stingy. If he is of average means and wants to show signs of richness such as buying an expensive car so that he will look rich, and he does not have enough money to perform Hajj, then he has to sell the car and use that money to perform Hajj, and he should buy a car that suits his situation. His spending on this car is not a kind of spending that is approved of in shari’ah, rather it is extravagance, which is forbidden in Islam. 
What is meant by financially able is that he should have enough for his family until he returns, and he should have an income after he returns to take care of himself and those on whom he spends, such as rent from property, a salary and business earnings, etc.  
Hence he does not have to use the capital of his business, the profit of which he spends on himself and his family, to do Hajj, if that loss of capital will result in a loss of profits which in turn will mean that his family does not have enough. 
The Standing Committee (11/36) was asked about a man who has a sum of money in an Islamic bank and his income came from the profits on that money which gave him enough to live a moderate lifestyle. Is he obliged to do Hajj using that capital, knowing that this would affect his monthly income and stretch his finances unbearably? 
They replied: 
“If your situation is as you describe, you are not obliged to perform Hajj because you are not able to in the manner required by shari’ah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence).” [Al 'Imran 3:97]
And He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and [Allah] has not laid upon you in religion any hardship.” [al-Hajj 22:78]”  
Meaning of basic needs
What is meant by basic needs is what a person needs a great deal of in his life, and which it is too hard for him to do without, such as books for the seeker of knowledge. So we do not tell him: Sell your books and use the money to go for Hajj, because these are basic needs for him. Similarly if a person needs his car, we do not tell him, Sell it and use the money to go to Hajj. But if he has two cars and he does not need one of them, then he has to sell one of them and use the money to go to Hajj. 
Similarly, a craftsman does not need to sell his tools, because he needs them. And if a man has a car which he uses for work and spends on himself and his family from the money he earns for hiring it out, he does not have to sell it in order to go for Hajj. 
Another basic need is the need to get married. 
If a person needs to get married, that takes precedence over Hajj , otherwise Hajj takes precedence. 
What is meant by being financially able is that a person should have surplus funds that are sufficient for doing Hajj after paying off debts and taking care of shar’i obligations and basic needs. 
If a person is physically and financially able to do Hajj, then he is obliged to hasten to do Hajj. 
If he is not physically and financially able, or if he is physically able but he is poor and has no wealth, then he is not obliged to do Hajj. 
If a person is financially able but he is not physically able, then we look at the matter further. 
If his problem is something that he hopes will disappear, such as a sickness from which he hopes to recover, then he should wait until Allah heals him, then do Hajj.   
If his problem is one for which there is no hope that it will disappear, such as a person with cancer or an old person who cannot do Hajj, then he has to appoint someone to do Hajj on his behalf, and the duty to perform Hajj is not waived because of his physical inability if he is financially able.  
The evidence for that is the report narrated by al-Bukhari (1513) according to which a woman said: “O Messenger of Allah, Allah’s command to the people to perform Hajj has come when my father is an old man and cannot sit firmly in the saddle. Can I perform Hajj on his behalf?” He said: “Yes.” 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) agreed with her comment that Hajj was obligatory for her father even though he was physically unable to perform Hajj. 
Can women go to Hajj without a mahram?
In order for Hajj to be obligatory for a woman, it is essential for her to have a mahram with her , and it is not permissible for her to travel for Hajj, whether that is an obligatory or nafl Hajj, without a mahram. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No woman should travel except with a mahram.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1862; Muslim 1341) 
The mahram is her husband or one whom it is permanently forbidden for her to marry because of blood ties, breastfeeding or ties through marriage. The husband of a sister, maternal aunt or paternal aunt is not a mahram. 
Some women take this matter lightly and travel with their sister and sister’s husband, or with a maternal aunt and the aunt’s husband, but this is haram, because the sister’s husband or the maternal aunt’s husband is not a mahram, so it is not permissible for her to travel with him. So there is the fear that her Hajj is not proper, for the proper Hajj (Hajj mabrur) is that which is not mixed with any sin, but this woman is sinning throughout her journey until she returns home. 
It is also essential that the mahram be an adult of sound mind, because the aim of the mahram is to protect the woman, and a child or one who is insane cannot do that. 
If a woman does not have a mahram, or she has one but he is unable to travel with her, then she is not obliged to do Hajj. 
Should the wife ask for her husband’s permission to go to Hajj? 
The husband’s permission is not an essential condition of it being obligatory for a woman to do Hajj, rather she is obliged to do Hajj when the conditions of it being obligatory are met, even if her husband does not give permission. 
The Standing Committee said (11/20): 
“The obligatory Hajj is obligatory when the conditions of being able to do it are met, and the husband’s permission is not one of them. It is not permissible for him to forbid her, rather it is prescribed for him to cooperate with her in fulfilling this duty. End quote. 
This has to do with the obligatory Hajj. As for nafl Hajj, Ibn al-Mundhir narrated that the scholars were unanimously agreed that a husband has the right to forbid his wife from doing a nafl Hajj, because the husband’s rights are binding upon her and are not superseded by something that is not obligatory for her. (Al-Mughni, 5/35)

Al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Sh. Ibn Uthaymin, 7/5-27.",Islam Q&A
41959,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41959,Ruling on making death announcements from mosque minarets via loudspeaker,Is announcing a person’s death in the mosque haram?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade making death announcements; what is meant by this prohibition is what the people of the Jaahiliyyah used to do, when they used to send someone to announce a death in a loud voice. Hence the majority of scholars are of the view that if making an announcement involves raising the voice, it is not allowed. 
Some of the Hanafis are of the view that it is not makrooh to call out news of a death in the alleys and markets, if it is a simple announcement which does not speak of the person’s good characteristics. 
They said: Because that will increase the number of people who offer the funeral prayer for the deceased and pray for forgiveness for him. It is not like the death announcements of the Jaahiliyyah, for they used to send people to the tribes, announcing the death with screaming, weeping, wailing, elegizing, etc. My response to that is that the aim of increasing the number of people who offer the funeral prayer for the deceased and pray for forgiveness for him can be achieved without calling out and raising the voice. 
Moreover, raising the voice with news of a death is like the Jaahili way of making death announcements, which is forbidden. 
See al-‘Inaayah Sharh al-Hidaayah, 3/267; Fath al-Qadeer, 2/128; al-Khurashi ‘ala Mukhtasar Khaleel, 2/139; al-Muhadhdhab, 1/132; al-Sharh al-Kabeer, 6/287; Fath al-Baari, 3/117 
Al-San’aani said in Subul al-Salaam (1/482): 
In al-Nihaayah it says that it was well known among the Arabs that when a nobleman among them died or was killed, they would send a rider to the tribes to announce his death to them, and he would say, “I announce the death of So and so, I announce the death of the Arabs; or So and so has died, the Arabs are doomed because of the death of So and so.” 
Then al-San’aani said: It seems more likely to me that this is what is forbidden, and that includes announcing deaths from the top of the minarets as is done nowadays when leaders die. End quote. 
Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining what is forbidden for the relatives of the deceased: 
Announcing the death from the tops of the minarets and the like, because that is a kind of death announcement (al-na’i), and it is proven from Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan that when one of his relatives died he would say, “Do not tell anyone, for I fear that this would be a death announcement, and I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbidding death announcements.” 
In Arabic, the word al-na’i (translated here as death announcement) means informing others of the death of a person. This includes all forms of giving this information. But the saheeh ahaadeeth indicate that some kinds of informing others of a death are permissible, and the scholars gave a specific definition to the general term al-na’i. They said: what is meant by al-na’i is announcements that are similar to what the people of the Jaahiliyyah used to do, where they would shout at the doors of houses and in the marketplace. 
Al-Haafiz said: What we learn from this is that not all kinds of death announcements are forbidden, rather what is forbidden is what the people of the Jaahiliyyah used to do; they used to send out people to announce the death of a person at the doors of houses and in the markets. 
I (al-Albaani) say: Once this is understood, shouting news of a death from the tops of minarets is certainly a form of al-na’i, hence we are certain that it is haram. It may be accompanied by other things that are haram in and of themselves, such as accepting payment for that shouting, or praising the deceased person by saying things that are known to be untrue, such as saying, “Pray for one who was most noble and generous, or Pray for one who followed in the footsteps of the righteous salaf.”  
Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz, p. 44-46. 
This is the answer if what is meant in the question is making death announcements from the minaret over loudspeakers. 
If what is meant is simply informing the worshippers in the mosque of the death without raising the voice, there is nothing wrong with that in sha Allah. This is like what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did after the death of the Negus, when he informed the Sahaabah of his death and announced it to them so that they could offer the funeral prayer for him. 
Al-Bukhari (1333) and Muslim (951) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) announced the death of al-Najaashi (the Negus, the ruler of Abyssinia) on the day on which he died. He took them out to the prayer place, arranged them in rows and said four takbeers (i.e., offered the funeral prayer for him). According to a report narrated by al-Bukhari, 1328: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) announced to us the death of the Negus, the ruler of Abyssinia, on the day on which he died, and said, “Pray for forgiveness for your brother.” 
Al-Nawawi said in Sharh Muslim: 
This shows that it is mustahabb to announce the death of a person, but not in the manner in which deaths were announced in the Jaahiliyyah; rather it should be done simply for the purpose of notifying people so that they can come to the prayer, and to encourage people to attend his funeral and to fulfil their duty towards him in that regard. The prohibition on death announcements does not apply to this, rather it applies to the jaahili forms of death announcements which includes mention of the good qualities of the deceased and so on.

    because the texts point to the virtue of Hajj. It was narrated that the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Follow one 
    Hajj or ‘Umrah with another, for they erase poverty and sin as the bellows 
    erases the dross of iron and gold and silver.” A wise person can go for Hajj 
    and not annoy others or be annoyed if he deals kindly with people. If he 
    finds enough room he can do whatever acts of worship he is able to, and if 
    there is not much room then he should treat himself and others in the manner 
    dictated by the crowded conditions. Hence when the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) moved on from ‘Arafah he urged the people 
    to be tranquil and dignified, and he pulled his camel’s reins tight so that 
    it would not walk fast. But when he found that he had room, he would hasten. 
    This indicates that the pilgrim should deal with the situation as he finds 
    it. If there is not much room he should walk slowly and be kind to people. 
    In this way he will not be annoyed or annoy others. This is what we think he 
    should do in this situation: he should go for Hajj and seek Allaah's help to 
    do Hajj; he should do what he is obliged to do and should strive not to 
    annoy anyone or to be annoyed as much as he can.  

    If we assume that there is an interest that outweighs Hajj, 
    such as if the Muslims need money for jihad for the sake of Allaah, then 
    jihad for the sake of Allaah takes precedence over a naafil Hajj. In that 
    case he should donate this money to the mujaahideen. Or if the Muslims are 
    experiencing a famine, he should donate this money to the Muslims. In that 
    case using the money to help relieve the famine is better than using it for 
    Hajj. End quote.","Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 21/28, 29"
41978,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41978,"The meeqaat for the people of Sudan, Somalia and Ethiopia","From where should the people of Sudan, Somalia and Ethiopia enter ihraam? 

What is the ruling on those of them who come for Hajj or ‘Umrah without ihraam, then they enter ihraam after a few days and go straight to Makkah?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The meeqaat for the people of Ethiopia and Somalia: if they 
    come from the south, when they are parallel with Yalamlam, which the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) decreed as the meeqaat for 
    the people of Yemen, they should enter ihraam when they are parallel with 
    it. If they come from the north of Jeddah, their meeqaat is al-Juhfah which 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) decreed was the 
    meeqaat for the people of Syria. The people substituted Raabigh for it 
    because it fell into ruin. If they are coming from between those points, 
    heading for Jeddah, then their meeqaat is Jeddah, because they are reaching 
    Jeddah before they come in line with either of the two meeqaats mentioned 
    above.  

    Similarly if the people of Sudan are coming to Jeddah, then 
    their meeqaat is Jeddah. If they are coming from the north, their meeqaat is 
    when they come in line with al-Juhfah or Raabigh. If they are coming from 
    the south then their meeqaat is when they come in line with Yalamlam. So the 
    meeqaat of the people of these countries varies according to the route by 
    which they are coming. This applies if they are coming for ‘Umrah or for 
    Hajj. 

    But if a person is coming for work and he has already done 
    the obligatory ‘Umrah and Hajj, then he does not have to enter ihraam, 
    because Hajj and ‘Umrah are only obligatory once in a lifetime. If a person 
    has already done them, they are not obligatory a second time, except in the 
    case of a vow. 

    If a person comes for Hajj or ‘Umrah and does not enter ihram 
    until after he passed the two meeqaats or one of them, then the scholars say 
    that his ihraam is valid, but he has to offer a sacrifice, to be slaughtered 
    in Makkah and distributed to the poor, because he has omitted one of the 
    obligatory duties of ihraam, which is entering ihraam from the meeqaat. If 
    this happens to a person, he has to offer a sacrifice to be slaughtered in 
    Makkah and distributed to the poor if he is rich; if he is poor, he does not 
    have to do anything, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you 
    can”

    [al-Taghaabun 64:16]
See Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 21/283, 284 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked 
    about the meeqaat for the people of Sudan. He replied: 

    It depends on the route taken. If their route takes them past 
    the meeqaat of al-Juhfah, they have to enter ihraam when they come in line 
    with it. If their route does not take them past any meeqaat until they reach 
    Jeddah, then they should enter ihraam from Jeddah, if they want to perform 
    Hajj and ‘Umrah. End quote.
