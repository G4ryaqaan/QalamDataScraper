13702,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13702,A wife giving up her right to maintenance; and is the first wife’s approval needed before one can marry a second wife?,"Is it halal to have a second wife who says she does not need financial support. If so, what if the first wife does not allow the marriage..can a man still get married again?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Maintenance 
          is one of the rights of the wife which is an obligation upon her husband. 
          Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“Men 
          are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made 
          one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) 
          from their means.” 
[al-Nisaa’ 
          4:34]
If the 
          woman foregoes this right, to which she is entitled – which is her maintenance– 
          then it is no longer obligatory upon her husband.  
Ibn 
          Qudaamah said: If she agrees to forego some part of her share (of her 
          husband’s time) or her maintenance, or all of that, this is permissible. 
          (al-Mughni, vol. 7, p. 244).  
With 
          regard to the permission and approval of the first wife for a plural 
          marriage, this is not a condition and the husband does not have to seek 
          the permission of his first wife to marry a second. But it is prescribed 
          for him to be kind to her and to spend money and to say kind words so 
          as to calm her down and reduce her jealousy. The Standing Committee 
          was asked about the first wife’s approval for one who wants to marry 
          another wife. Their response was:  
It is not obligatory for the husband, 
          if he wants to take a second wife, to have the approval of the first 
          wife, but it is the matter of good manners and kind treatment that he 
          should speak to her kindly in such a way as to reduce the feelings of 
          hurt which are natural in women in such cases.  That is by smiling 
          at her, showing that he is happy to see her, being kind, speaking nicely 
          and by spending money on her if necessary.

If possible, I would like a response to my question through email... Insha-ALLAH. If not, just answering this question would be of a ""BIG"" help to me, since my parents don't know the answer to this question....",It is not permissible to talk to your fiancé except in a case where both parties trust one another and where the parents agree to the marriage and have no objections.,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to talk to your fiancé except in a case where both parties trust one another and where the parents agree to the marriage and have no objections. In this case it is acceptable for them to speak to one another in a normal manner, discussing matters of life that concern them . But if they know that their parents do not agree to that, then it is not permissible for them to speak to one another in this case.
 Shaykh `Abullah ibn Jibrin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“The fiancée is still a non-Mahram woman and speaking to her is still speaking to a non-Mahram woman , so it must be done properly and only as much as is necessary, such as agreeing on specific matters to do with after they get married. Attention must also be paid to the following:

It must be done with the agreement of the woman’s guardian and with no objection on his part to the marriage.
The talk should not involve anything that may provoke desire or cause temptation.
There should be no other way of telling her what he wants to say, such as through his sister or her brother, or by letter.
It should not go beyond what is essential.”

13705,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13705,He wants to pray in school but he cannot find a place to pray in,"what if you at school and you dont get home tell 4:00 p.m and you have to pray for salat althoher, what can you do if their is no room for muslems to pray?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
Allaah has blessed this ummah with many great blessings, among which is the fact 
that Allaah has bestowed upon this ummah unique privileges which He did not 
bestow upon the previous nations. These unique privileges include the fact that 
they may pray in any place so long as that place is taahir (pure, clean) and not 
naajis (unclean) and is not a place where it is forbidden to pray. It says in a 
hadeeth whose authenticity is agreed upon, which was narrated from Jaabir ibn 
‘Abd-Allaah, that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
him) said: “I have been given five things that were not given to any of the 
Prophets before me. I have been granted victory by means of awe, (by His 
frightening my enemies) for a distance of one month’s journey; the earth has 
been made a mosque (place of worship) for me and a means of purification, 
therefore anyone of my ummah can pray whenever the time for prayer is due; the 
spoils of war have been made permissible for me; and each Prophet was sent only 
to his own people, but I have been sent to all of mankind; and I have been 
granted (the power of) intercession.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 419; Muslim, 810). 
Undoubtedly this is a great blessing which makes things easier for the Muslims. 
So you may pray anywhere in the school, so long as it is a clean place. 
Please see also Question No.
9455. 
With regard to the places where it is forbidden to pray, such as graveyards and 
washrooms, it was narrated in a saheeh report that the Prophet (peace and 
blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “All of the earth is a mosque, apart from 
graveyards and washrooms.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, al-Salaah, 291; classed as 
saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 262). 
It was also narrated that it is forbidden to pray in the places where camels 
sit, and other places where there is evidence (daleel) to say that it is 
forbidden to pray in them. 
Undoubtedly the matter of prayer is one of the matters which cannot be taken 
lightly. So you must strive to pray before the time of that prayer is over. May 
Allaah help you to obey Him. And Allaah knows best. May Allaah bless our Prophet

    Homosexuality is a major sin which deserves the most severe 
    of punishments in this world and in the Hereafter. See Question no.
    5177. But the person who does that cannot be 
    described as a kaafir because of that, unless he thinks that it is 
    permissible and claims that it is halaal – in which he is to be denounced as 
    a kaafir. But simply doing it whilst admitting that it is haraam does not 
    put a Muslim beyond the pale of Islam. He is still a Muslim, but he is 
    exposed to the wrath of Allaah and is committing a major sin. It is not 
    permissible for you to go ahead and marry him until he repents sincerely. 
    Simply promising does not count as repentance. My advice to you is not to go 
    ahead and marry him, rather you have to look for a righteous man who will be 
    the means of bringing you happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. 
    Homosexuality, just like other major sins, is open to repentance: whoever 
    repents, Allaah will accept his repentance.",Shaykh ‘Abd al-Kareem al-Khudayr

          Firstly: 
 
          It is not permissible for your father to neglect prayer, 
          because neglecting prayer is kufr (disbelief). See the answer to Question 
          # 2182 and 10094.
 
           Secondly: 
 
          Your father must beware of the consequences of this action, 
          which is that he is telling others to do what is right but not doing 
          it himself, and forbidding them to do what is wrong but doing it himself. 
          There are severe warnings to those who do this. 
 
          It was narrated that Usaamah ibn Zayd said: “I heard 
          the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, ‘A man will be brought 
          on the Day of Resurrection and will be thrown into Hell, where his intestines 
          will be spilled out and he will go around like a donkey goes around 
          a millstone. The people of Hell will gather around him and say: O so-and-so! 
          What is wrong with you? Didn't you use to order us to do good deeds 
          and forbid us to do bad deeds? He will reply: Yes, I used to order you 
          to do good deeds, but I did not do them myself, and I used to forbid 
          you to do bad deeds, yet I used to do them myself.’”
 
          (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3027; Muslim, 5305) 
 
          Thirdly:
 
          Your duty towards your father is to try your best to 
          call him (da’wah) and tell him that it is obligatory to do the prayers, 
          with wisdom and beautiful preaching. Your eagerness to guide your father 
          is one of the greatest ways in which you can honour him. You have to 
          be patient when doing that, and strive hard in making du’aa’ that he 
          will be guided. 
 
          Remember the story of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) and 
          his father, who was calling him to shirk, and how Ibraaheem replied 
          to him and was kind and gentle in the way that he spoke to him. 
 
          And remember the story of Abu Hurayrah with his mother, 
          and how keen he was to call his mother and guide her to Islam. Perhaps 
          (these stories) may encourage you to strive in calling your father. 
 
          It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: “I used to call my mother (to 
          Islam) when she was still a mushrikah. I called her one day and she 
          said something about the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of  Allaah be upon him) that upset me. I went 
          to the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaaah be upon him), weeping. I said, ‘O Messenger 
          of Allaah, I was calling my mother to Islam and she refused. I called 
          her today and she said something about you that I upset me. Pray to 
          Allaah to guide the mother of Abu Hurayrah.’ So the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaaah be upon him) said, ‘O Allaah, guide 
          the mother of Abu Hurayrah.’ I left, feeling hopeful because of the 
          du’aa’ of the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). When I got home, I went 
          to the door and found it slightly ajar. My mother heard my footsteps 
          and said, ‘Stay where you are, O Abu Hurayrah!’ I could hear the sound 
          of water. She bathed and put on her garment, and hastened to put on 
          her khimaar, then she opened the door and said, ‘O Abu Hurayrah, I bear 
          witness that there is no god but Allaah and I bear witness that Muhammad 
          is the Messenger of Allaah.’ I went back to the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) weeping with joy. I said, 
          ‘O Messenger of Allaah, Allaah has answered your prayer and guided the 
          mother of Abu Hurayrah. He praised and thanked Allaah, and said good 
          words. I said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, pray to Allaah to make me and 
          my mother beloved to the believers and make them beloved to us.’ The 
          Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaaah be upon him) said, ‘O Allaah, make this 
          little slave of Yours – meaning Abu Hurayrah – and his mother beloved 
          to Your believing slaves and make the believers beloved to them.’ No 
          believer heard of me or saw me but he loved me.”
 
          (Narrated by Muslim, Fadaa’il al-Sahaabah, 4546)

13711,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13711,Fasting the Day of Doubt,"On the night of the thirtieth of Sha’ban we went out to sight the crescent, but the weather was cloudy so we could not see it. Should we fast the thirtieth day of Sha’ban, because it is a day concerning which there is some doubt?",Fasting the day of doubt is haram because the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the Companions to fast it,,"Praise be to Allah.This is what is called the “day of doubt ”, because there is doubt concerning it – is it the last day of Sha’ban or the first day of Ramadan?
Fasting the day of doubt is haram because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Fast when you see the new moon and break your fast when you see the new moon , and if you are not sure, then complete the number of Sha’ban as thirty days.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1909) 
‘Ammar ibn Yasir said: “Whoever fasts on the day concerning which there is doubt has disobeyed Abu’l-Qasim (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” This was narrated by al-Tirmidhi and classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 553. 
Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar said: “It was understood from this that it is haram to fast the day of doubt, because the Sahabah would not say such a thing based on personal opinion, so a report such as this has the same status as a marfu’ hadith.” 
The scholars of the Standing Committee said concerning the day of doubt, “The Sunnah indicates that it is haram to fast this day.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah, 10/117) 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, after mentioning the difference of opinion concerning the ruling on fasting the day of doubt: 
“The most correct of these views is that it is haram, but if it is proven to the ruler that it is obligatory to fast this day and he commands the people to fast, then no one should go against his opinion, and that means that no one should show that he is not fasting on that day, rather a person (who has a different opinion) may not fast, but he should do so secretly.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/318)

13713,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13713,The view of Ahl al-Sunnah towards the Sahaabah and the leadership of Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq,what evidence do you have that tells you Imama Ali(A.S.) isnt suppose to be  the leader after th Prophet muhammed(A.S).,,,"Praise be to Allah.One of the basic principles of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah is that they have nothing against the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and they do not say anything against them. Their hearts are free of any hatred, resentment and rancour (towards them) and they do not say anything (about them) that is not appropriate or befitting, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who came after them say: ‘Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith, and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful’”[Al-Hashr :10]
And they obey the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: “Do not revile my companions, for by the One in Whose hand is my soul, if one of you were to spend in charity gold equal to the size of Mount Uhud, he would not achieve the status of one of them, or even come halfway.” (narrated by al-Bukhari, 3637; Muslim, 2541).
One of the basic principles of Ahl al-Sunnah is that they accept that which has been narrated in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and the consensus of the scholars, concerning the virtues and status (of the Sahaabah). They give precedence to those who spent and fought before the victory – the treaty of al-Hudaybiyah – over those who spent and fought afterwards, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Not equal among you are those who spent and fought before the Victory. Such are higher in degree than those who spent and fought afterwards. But to all Allah has promised the best (reward). And Allah is All-Aware of what you do” [Al-Hadeed 57:10]
They give precedence to the Muhaajireen over the Ansaar, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And the foremost to embrace Islam of the Muhaajiroon and the Ansaar and also those who followed them exactly (in Faith). Allah is well-pleased with them as they are well-pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success”
[Al-Tawbah 9:100.] So the aayah gives precedence to the Muhaajireen over the Ansaar.
They believe that Allah said concerning the people of Badr – who numbered three hundred and umpteen – “Do whatever you like, for I have forgiven you,” because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Maybe Allah looked at the people of Badr and said, ‘Do whatever you like, for I have forgiven you.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3007; Muslim, 2494 - from the hadith of ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib) 
They believe that no-one who gave the oath of allegiance (bay’ah) under the tree will enter Hell, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said. Rather Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him, and they numbered more than one thousand and four hundred. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Indeed, Allah was pleased with the believers when they gave the Bay‘ah (pledge) to you (O Muhammad) under the tree, He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent down As-Sakeenah (calmness and tranquillity) upon them, and He rewarded them with a near victory”[Al-Fath 48:18]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “In sha Allah, no one among the companions of the tree, those who gave their oath of allegiance beneath the tree, will enter Hell.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2496). Among those who pledged allegiance beneath the tree were Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthmaan and ‘Ali, may Allah be pleased with them all. 
And they (Ahl al-Sunnah) bear witness that those will enter Paradise who the Messenger of Allah bore witness that they would enter, such as the ten (who were given the glad tidings of Paradise), and Thaabit ibn Qays ibn Shammaas, and others among the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Abu Bakr will be in Paradise, ‘Umar will be in Paradise, ‘Uthmaan will be in Paradise, ‘Ali will be in Paradise, Talhah will be in Paradise, al-Zubayr will be in Paradise, ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Awf will be in Paradise, Sa’d will be in Paradise, Sa’eed will be in Paradise and Abu ‘Ubaydah ibn al-Jarraah will be in Paradise.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4649; al-Tirmidhi, 3747; classed as saheeh by al-Albani). 
They affirm that which has been narrated in mutawaatir reports from ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) and others, that the best among this ummah after its Prophet is Abu Bakr, then ‘Umar. It was narrated that Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah said: “I said to my father (‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib), ‘Which of the people is the best after the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)?’ He said, ‘Abu Bakr.’ I asked, ‘Then who?’ He said, ‘ ‘Umar.’ I was worried that he would say ‘Uthmaan, so I said, ‘Then is it you?’ He said, ‘I am just a man among the Muslims.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3671). So they (Ahl al-Sunnah) list ‘Uthmaan as the third and ‘Ali as the fourth, may Allah be pleased with them. 
See al-Waasitiyyah by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, with commentary. 
Secondly: it is part of the belief of Ahl al-Sunnah that the most deserving of the people to succeed the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him). The evidence for the leadership of Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) is as follows: 
1 – It was narrated from Muhammad ibn Jubayr ibn Mut’im that his father said: “A woman came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he told her to come back later. She said, ‘What if I come back and do not find you?’ as if she was referring to death. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘If you do not find me, then go to Abu Bakr.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3659). 
2 – It was narrated that Ibn Mas’ood said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Take as your leaders those who come after me, Abu Bakr and ‘Umar.’” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3805; classed as saheeh by al-Albani). 
3 – It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Whilst I was standing by a well, drawing water from it, Abu Bakr and ‘Umar came. Abu Bakr took the bucket and drew one or two buckets, but there was some weakness in his drawing. May Allah forgive him. Then ‘Umar bin Al-Khattaab came and the bucket turned into a very large one in his hands. I had never seen such a mighty person as he in doing such hard work till all the people drank to their satisfaction and watered their camels that knelt down there.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3676).  
Ibn Hajar said in his commentary on this hadith: 
“Whilst I was standing by a well” means, in a dream. “Drawing water from it” means, filling a bucket with water. “He drew one or two buckets (dhanooban aw dhanoobayn)”: dhanoob refers to a large bucket when it is full of water. It seems to me that this refers to the major conquests which took place during his reign (as khaleefah), which numbered three. Hence the hadith does not refer to the number of buckets in the case of ‘Umar, rather it describes his drawing of water as ‘mighty’, referring to the many conquests that would occur during his reign as khaleefah. And Allah knows best. 
Al-Shaafa’i mentioned the interpretation of this hadith in al-Umm, where after quoting it he said: The meaning of the phrase “but there was some weakness in his drawing” is that his time of leadership was short, because of his untimely death and the fact that the war against the apostates (ahl al-riddah) kept him from reaching the level of conquests attained by ‘Umar during his lengthy reign as khaleefah. 
With regard to the phrase “May Allah forgive him,” al-Nawawi said: This is a du’aa’ on the part of the one who is speaking, i.e., there can be no other interpretation. Others said that it was an indication that the death of Abu Bakr was close. A similar case is to be seen in the aayah in which Allah says to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): 
“So glorify the Praises of your Lord, and ask His forgiveness. Verily, He is the One Who accepts the repentance and Who forgives”[Al-Nasr 110:3 – interpretation of the meaning]
This aayah was an indication that the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was close. I say: it may be that it was an indication that the small number of conquests during his time was not his fault, because the reason for that was the brevity of his rule, and the meaning of forgiveness is to remove any blame from him. 
“And the bucket turned into a very large one in his hands” means, it became a huge bucket. “I had never seen such a mighty person as he” means that he achieved the ultimate. 
4 – It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to me when he was sick, ‘Call Abu Bakr for me, your father and your brother, so that I may dictate a letter. For I am worried lest someone who is ambitious says that he is more entitled to the position of leadership, but Allah and the believers will not accept anyone other than Abu Bakr.’” (Narrated by Muslim, 2387). 
5 – During his final illness, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) appointed Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq to lead the Muslims in prayer and he did not accept anyone else to take his place. The fact that he was appointed to take his place in the case of minor leadership (leading the prayers) indicates that he would succeed him in the case of major leadership (as imam or khaleefah).

13717,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13717,Rulings on trusts,Can you tell us some of the rulings that have to do with trusts (wadee’ah) or things entrusted to someone’s care?,,,"Praise be to Allah.This refers to entrusting something to someone to keep it for you voluntarily.
Wadee’ah in Arabic means leaving a thing (with someone). In sharee’ah it means the property which is left with someone to take care of it for nothing in return.
In order for this action to be valid, the person with whom it is left must be a sane, mature adult, because this means entrusting the thing to him to take care of it.
It is mustahabb for the person who knows himself to be trustworthy and able to take care of the thing to accept the trust, because that will being a great reward, as it says in the hadeeth of the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Allah will help His slave so long as the slave helps his brother.” And because people need this. But if he knows that he is not able to take care of it, then it is makrooh for him to accept this trust.
One of the rules concerning trusts is that if it is destroyed or damaged whilst in the care of the one to whom it has been entrusted, through no negligence on his part, then he is not responsible for replacing it, such as if it is destroyed or damaged along with some of his own property, because it was something entrusted and the one to whom it was entrusted is not responsible for replacing it if he did not overstep the mark. It was narrated in a hadeeth which is da’eef (weak) to some extent that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever is entrusted with something, is not responsible for replacing it.” This was narrated by Ibn Maajah. Al-Daraaqutni narrated a slightly different version: “The one to whom something is entrusted is not responsible for replacing it, except in the case of one who betrays that trust.” According to another version: “The one who is entrusted with something is not obliged to replace it,” because the one who is keeping it is doing so voluntarily.
If he were to be held responsible, people would refuse to accept trusts of this nature, which would cause a lot of harm for people and would not serve their interests.
But the one who oversteps the mark with regard to something that has been entrusted to him, or who is negligent in looking after it, is responsible for replacing it if it is damaged or destroyed, because he has caused the property of another person to be damaged or destroyed.
Another of the rulings concerningtrusts is that the one to whom it has been entrusted has to keep itin a place where things of that nature are usually kept, just as he looks after his own property, because Allah has commanded that trusts should be rendered back, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, Allah commands that you should render back the trusts to those, to whom they are due” [al-Nisaa’ 4:58]
And they can only be rendered back by taking care of them. When the one to whom it is entrusted accepts that trust, he is obliged to take care of it and to do what is expected of him. If the thing entrusted is an animal, then the one to whom it is entrusted has to feed it. If he stops feeding it without being given permission by the owner and it dies, then he is obliged to replace it, because feeding the animal is essential. Along with being responsible for replacing it, he is also guilty of sin for not feeding it or giving it water until it died, because he is obliged to give it food and water as is enjoined by Allah, because its rights are sacred and are protected (by sharee’ah).
It is permissible for the person to whom something has been entrusted to give it to a person who usually takes care of his property, such as his wife, slave, storekeeper or servant. If it gets damaged or destroyed when in the care of one of these people, through no transgression or negligence on their part, then he is not responsible for replacing it, because he has the right to take care of it himself or to delegate that to his deputy. The same applies if he gives it to a person who takes care of the property of its owner; he is not responsible for replacing it, because this is the custom.","From al-Mulakhkhas al-Fiqhi by Shaykh Saalih ibn Fawzan Aal Fawzaan, p. 137"
13718,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13718,Rulings on missing persons,What should a person do if he finds a lost child?,,,"Praise be to Allah. Rulings 
          on missing or lost persons are connected to a large extent to the rulings 
          on lost property, because (in Arabic) luqtah (lost property) refers 
          to property that is lost, and laqeet (lost person) refers to a person 
          who is lost. This indicates how the rulings of Islam cover all aspects 
          of life in a way that is far superior to what is known in the modern 
          world where orphanages and refuges are set up to take care of orphans 
          and old people. An example of this is how Islam takes care of the laqeet 
          (lost person), i.e., the child who is found cast out or having wandered 
          away from his family, and his lineage is unknown in either case. The 
          person who finds him in this case is obliged to take him in, as this 
          is fard kifaayah – if some Muslims do it then the rest will not be counted 
          as having sinned, but if none of them do it then they will all be sinners, 
          if they could have taken him in, because Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning): 
 “Help 
          you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness 
          and piety)”
 [al-Maa'idah 
          5:2]
 The 
          general meaning of the aayah indicates that the lost child should be 
          taken in, because this is part of cooperating in righteousness and piety, 
          and because taking him in is saving his life, so it is obligatory, like 
          feeding him if he is in need and saving him if he is drowning. 
 The 
          lost child is free in all aspects, because the basic principle is that 
          people are free, and slavery is the exception; if a person is not known 
          to be a slave then the basic principle is that he is not a slave.
 Whatever 
          money is found on him or around him belongs to him, based on what appears 
          to be the case, because he has it in his possession. The one who found 
          him should spend on him from this money, within reason, because he is 
          his guardian. If he did not find any money with him then his keep should 
          be paid for from Bayt al-Maal (the treasury of the Muslims), because 
          ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said to the one who took in a 
          lost child when he found him, “Go, he is free and you are his guardian, 
          and we will spend on him” – i.e., from the Bayt al-Maal of the Muslims. 
 According 
          to another version, ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “And 
          we will pay for his breastfeeding,” i.e., from the Bayt al-Maal. So 
          the one who finds a lost child does not have to spend on him or on his 
          breastfeeding; that is an obligation on the Bayt al-Maal. If that is 
          not possible, then those Muslims who know about him have to spend on 
          him, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 “Help 
          you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness 
          and piety)”
 [al-Maa'idah 
          5:2]
 And 
          because not spending on him will lead to his death, and because spending 
          on him is like supporting him or offering hospitality to a guest. 
 The 
          ruling with regard to his religion is that if he is found in a Muslim 
          country or in a kaafir country in which there are many Muslims, then 
          he is a Muslim, because the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Every child is born 
          in a state of fitrah (the natural sate of man, i.e., Islam).” If he 
          is found in a country which is completely kaafir, or where there are 
          very few Muslims, then he is a kaafir, following the (religion of) that 
          country. Custody of him belongs to the one who found him, if he is trustworthy, 
          because ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) approved of Abu Jameelah 
          keepinb the lost child when he found out that he was a righteous man, 
          and he said, “You are his guardian,” i.e., he had guardianship of him 
          because he found him first and thus was more entitled to that. 
 The 
          who finds him should spend on him from what he found with him of money 
          or other things, because he is his guardian, so he should spend on him 
          in a reasonable manner. 
 If 
          the one who found him is not fit to take him into his care, because 
          he is immoral or a kaafir, and the lost child is a Muslim, then he should 
          not be left in his care, because the immoral person has no right of 
          guardianship and the kaafir has no right of guardianship over a Muslim; 
          and because he will tempt him away from his religion. Similarly the 
          child should not be left in the care of his finder if the latter is 
          a Bedouin (nomad) who travels from place to place, because that is tiring 
          for the child. So he should be taken from him and given to one who is 
          settled in one place, because placing the child in a settled environment 
          is better for his worldly and religious interests, and it provides a 
          better chance for him to find his family and know where he comes from. 
 In 
          the case where a lost person dies or is killed and diyah (blood money) 
          is to be paid, whatever wealth he leaves behind and the diyah, if applicable, 
          are to be given to the Bayt al-Maal, if he has no heirs to inherit from 
          him such as his own children. If he has a wife, she gets one-quarter 
          of the inheritance. 
 In 
          the case of murder and aggression, his wali (next of kin) is the ruler, 
          because the Muslims will inherit from him, and the ruler is their deputy. 
          So he may choose between qasaas (retaliation in kind) or diyah (blood 
          money) to be given to Bayt al-Maal, because the ruler is the next of 
          kin of the one who has no next of kin. 
 If 
          (a lost child) is deliberately injured, but not killed, he should wait 
          until he reaches maturity, then he may retaliate in kind or forgive. 
          If a man or woman claims that the lost child is his or her child, he 
          should be regarded as such, because that is in his best interests, as 
          it connects him to his lineage and no harm is caused to anyone by doing 
          so. This is subject to the conditions that only one such claim is made 
          and that it is possible that the child belongs to him. But if more than 
          one person claims him, then priority should be given to one who has 
          evidence. If none of them have evidence, or they have conflicting evidence, 
          then he and they should be shown to people who have experience in detecting 
          family resemblances, and whoever they decide he most closely resembles 
          is the one to whom he should be given, because ‘Umar (may Allaah be 
          pleased with him) passed a judgement to that effect in the presence 
          of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them). Those who have experience 
          in detecting family resemblances can tell lineage by resemblance, and 
          the word of one such person is sufficient; this is subject to the condition 
          that he be male, of good character and with a good track record.","From al-Mulakhkhas al-Fiqhi by Shaykh Saalih ibn Fawzan Aal Fawzaan, p. 155"
13720,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13720,Rulings on Waqfs,What is the Islamic ruling on the issue of waqfs?,Waqf is an act of worship which is recommended in Islam (mustahabb). The one who establishes the waqf should be one who has the authority to dispose of this wealth. The property given as waqf should be something from which ongoing benefit may be derived whilst its original essence remains. It is obligatory to act in accordance with the wishes of the one who set up the waqf so long as it does not go against the Shari`ah.,"What is waqf?


Is waqf recommended?


Forms of waqf contract


Types of wording of waqf


Conditions of the validity of wqaf


Some rulings of waqf","Praise be to Allah.What is waqf?
Waqf means putting aside the original property and donating its benefits for the sake of Allah. What is meant by the original property is something from which benefit may be derived while its essence remains, such as houses, shops, gardens, etc. What is meant by benefits is beneficial produce that comes from the original property, such as crops, rents, provision of shelter, etc. 
Is waqf recommended?
The ruling concerning waqfs is that the waqf is an act of worship which is recommended in Islam (mustahabb). The evidence for that is the sahih Sunnah. 
In al-Sahihayn, it is narrated that ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “O Messenger of Allah, I have got wealth from Khaybar and I have nothing that is more precious to me than that. What do you command me to do with it?” He said, “If you wish, you can put it aside and give in charity from it (from what it produces), but the original property should not be sold, given away or inherited.” So ‘Umar gave it in charity to the poor and to relatives, used it to set slaves free, gave it for the sake of Allah, helped wayfarers and honoured his guests. Muslim narrated in his Sahih that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When the son of Adam dies, all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity, knowledge from which others may benefit after he is gone, and a righteous son who will pray for him.” Jabir said: “There was no one among the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who had the means, but he set up a waqf.” 
Qurtubah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “There is no dispute among the scholars concerning waqfs of aqueducts and mosques in particular, but they differed concerning other types of waqfs.” 
There is the condition that the one who establishes the waqf should be one who has the authority to dispose of this wealth, i.e., he should be an adult, free and mature, because a waqf made by a minor, a fool or a slave is not valid. 
Forms of waqf contract
The contract of the waqf is done in either of two ways: 

By saying something that indicates that a waqf is being established, such as saying, “I make this place a waqf” or “I make it a mosque.”
By doing something that customarily indicates a waqf, such as making a house into a mosque, or giving general permission to the people to pray there, or making one’s land into a graveyard and giving people permission to bury their dead there. 

Types of wording of waqf
Words which indicate a waqf are of two types: 

Clear words, such I saying “I make this a waqf,” or “I make this for the sake of Allah,” and so on… these words are clear, because they cannot be interpreted as meaning anything other than a waqf. When he utters these words it becomes a waqf with no need to add anything further.
Words which are indirect, such as “I give this in charity,” or “I deny myself its benefits” or “This is for the sake of Allah in perpetuity”. These are called indirect because they may be interpreted as meaning a waqf or something else. If he says an expression such as this, it has to be accompanied by the intention to set up a waqf, or one of the clear phrases, or one of the other indirect phrases. The clear phrases include “I give such and such in charity as a waqf, or for the sake of Allah, or denying myself its benefits, or in perpetuity.” Or the indirect words may be accompanied by the ruling on waqfs, such as saying, “I give such and such in charity and it is not to be sold or inherited.” 

Conditions of the validity of wqaf
Certain conditions apply in order for the waqf to be valid. These include: 

That the person who is setting up the waqf is one who has the authority to dispose of this wealth, as stated above.
That the property given as a waqf should be something from which ongoing benefit may be derived whilst its original essence remains. Things which do not remain after they have been used cannot be given as a waqf, such as food.
That the property given as a waqf should be something specific. A waqf consisting of something unspecified is invalid, such as saying, “I give one of my slaves or one of my houses as a waqf.”
The waqf should be for a good purpose, because the purpose behind it is to draw closer to Allah – such as mosques , aqueducts, waqfs for the poor, books of knowledge and waqfs to benefit relatives. It is not permissible to set up a waqf for purposes that are not good, such as waqfs for places of worship of the kuffar, or the books of the heretics, or for installing lights on tombs or perfuming them with incense, or to support those who look after tombs, because that is helping people to commit sin, shirk and kufr.
In order for the waqf to be valid if it refers to a specific thing, that thing should be in the firm possession of the one who is setting up the waqf. So one who cannot possess anything, such as the dead and animals, cannot set up a waqf.
In order for the waqf to be valid it must be executable with immediate effect. A waqf which is temporary or suspended is not valid, except when a person connects it to his death, such as saying, “When I die, my house will be a waqf for the poor,” because of what Abu Dawud narrated: “‘Umar made a will that if anything were to happen to him, then Samagh – some land which he owned – would be given in charity.”This became well known and no one denied this action, which amounted to unanimous agreement on this point. The waqf which is connected to a person’s death should be (no more than) one-third of the wealth, because it comes under the rulings of wills (wasiyyah).  

Some rulings of waqf

Among the rulings on waqfs is that it is obligatory to act in accordance with the wishes of the one who set up the waqf, so long as it does not go against the Shari`ah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Muslims are bound by their conditions, except for conditions which make haram things permissible or halal things forbidden.” 

`Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) set up a waqf and stipulated certain conditions, and if it had not been obligatory to adhere to the conditions there would have been no point in stipulating them. So if (the person setting up the waqf) stipulates a certain amount, or that some deserving people should be given precedence over others, or that those who are to benefit should have certain qualities or be free of certain qualities, etc., then it should be done in accordance with his conditions, so long as that does not go against the Quran or Sunnah. 

If he does not stipulate any conditions, then rich and poor, male and female, should be treated equally when given the benefits of the waqf . 
If he does not designate a specific person to be in charge of the waqf, or if he designates a specific person then that person dies, then the one to look after the waqf should be the one for whom it was set up. If the waqf was not set up to benefit a particular person, such as a waqf set up for a mosque, or for people who cannot be counted, such as the poor and needy, then the ruler should take care of the waqf, either in person or by delegating someone else to do it. 
The person who takes care of the waqf has to fear Allah and do a good job in taking care of the waqf, because that is something that has been entrusted to him (amanah).  
If a person sets up a waqf for his children , he must treat males and females equally, because he has included all of them in that, which implies that they all have an equal share. Just as if he were to give something to them, it should be shared equally among them, so too if he sets up a waqf for them, they should have equal shares. After his own children, the waqf should pass to the children of his sons, and not the children of his daughters, because they belong to another man and should be attributed to their father, because they are not included in the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah commands you as regards your children’s (inheritance):” [al-Nisa 4:11]. Some of the scholars think that they (daughter’s children) are included in the word “children”, because the daughters are also his children, so their (daughter’s) children are also his children in a real sense. And Allah knows best. 
If he says “I set up a waqf for my sons , or for the sons of So and So,” then the waqf is for the males only, because the word sons is used in the specific sense, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Or has He (Allah) only daughters and you have sons?.” [Al-Tur 52:39] 

Unless those for whom the waqf is set up are a tribe, such as Bani Hashim or Bani Tamim, in which case the women are also included, because the name of the tribe includes both the males and the females. 
But if the waqf is set up for a group who can be counted, they must all be included and treated equally. If they cannot all benefit from it because they are so many, such as Bani Hashim and Bani Tamim, then they do not all have to be included, because it is impossible, and it is permitted to limit it to some of them and give precedence to some of them over others. 
Waqfs are among the contracts which become binding just by speaking them, and it is not permissible to annul them, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The original property should not be sold, given as a gift or inherited.” Al-Tirmidhi said: “According to the scholars, it is not permissible to annul a waqf, based on this hadith and because it is established in perpetuity and is not to be sold or moved somewhere else unless its benefits cease altogether, such as a house which gets destroyed and cannot be rebuilt using the money of the waqf , or agricultural land which gets ruined and becomes dead and cannot be restored, and there are no funds from the waqf to restore it. In this case the waqf should be sold and the money spent on a similar thing, because this is closer to the aims of the waqf. If it is not possible to spend the money on something that is exactly the same, then it is to be spent on something smaller that is of the same nature, and the replacement becomes a waqf as soon as it is bought. 
If the waqf is a mosque and can no longer be used where it is, such as if the neighbourhood in which it is located is destroyed, then it should be sold and the money spent on another mosque. If a waqf is set up to benefit a mosque and produces more than is needed, it is permissible to spend the extra money on another mosque, because in this way the benefit is given to something similar to the purpose for which the waqf was set up. It is permissible to give in charity to the poor the extra benefits produced by a waqf that was set up to benefit a mosque. 
If a waqf is set up for a specific person, such as saying, “This is for Zayd; he is to be given one hundred of it every year,” and it produces more than that, then the extra amount should be given (in charity). Shaykh Taqiy al-Din (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “If he knows that the produce will always be more, then he has to dispose of it; withholding it is a waste of this extra amount.” 
If a waqf is set up to benefit a mosque, and that mosque is destroyed, and it is not possible to rebuild it from the waqf funds, then they should be given to other mosques.

13721,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13721,Selling by installments may be mustahabb,"I sell by installments, and when I do so I charge more than when selling for cash. Is it possible that I will be rewarded because I am helping the Muslims to buy what they need?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Selling by installments for a higher price is permissible. See Question no. 13973. 
With regard to selling by installments, the ruling as far as the seller is concerned may be that it is mustahabb or permissible. 
It may be mustahabb and he may be rewarded for it if his intention is to be easy-going to the purchaser and to help him to buy what he needs and he does not increase the price in return for allowing payment by installments if the customer is poor and in need, and he does not put pressure on him to pay it when it becomes due. Rather if the time for repayment comes and the customer does not have the money, he should give him more time, or let him off all or part of the price. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if the debtor is in a hard time (has no money), then grant him time till it is easy for him to repay; but if you remit it by way of charity, that is better for you if you did but know” [al-Baqarah 2:280]
Shaykh al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
This means, if the one who owes the money is in difficulty, his creditor must wait until things become easier for him… If the creditor shows charity towards him – by letting him off all or part of the debt – then that is better for him. Tafseer al-Sa’di, p. 168 
Al-Bukhaari (1307) and Muslim (1561) narrated that Abu Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A man from among those who came before you was brought to account, and nothing good was found in him, apart from the fact that he used to deal with the people and he was well off, and he used to tell his slaves to let off the (debtor) who was in difficulty. Allah said, ‘We have more right to that than him, let him off.’” 
But if a dealer sells in installments and he increases the price in return for payment by installments, this is permissible. But some dealers sell only by installments, so that their profits will be greater. Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) stated that this is makrooh, but if the dealer sells both by installments and for cash, there is nothing wrong with that. 
Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah – may Allah have mercy on him) explained the reason for it being makrooh as being that it comes under the heading of exploitation because usually the one who buys with deferred payment is the one who is unable to pay cash, so if a man only sells by installments, it means that he is exploiting people who are in need, but if he sells both for cash and by installments, he is just an ordinary trader.

13722,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13722,Stating one price for a product if paid for in cash and another price if paid for in installments,"Is it permissible to state one price for a product if the purchaser is going to pay for it in cash, and another price if the purchaser is going to pay for it in installments? For example, this car costs fifty thousand in cash and sixty thousand by installments?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If the vendor says: this car costs fifty thousand if paid for in cash and sixty thousand if paid for in installments, one of two scenarios must apply: 
1 – The seller and purchaser part having agreed on one price and method of payment. In this case the transaction is valid. 
2 – If they separate without having agreed on the price. This transaction is haraam and is not valid. 
Al-Baghawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh al-Sunnah – concerning this second type of transaction – This is invalid according to the majority of scholars, because it is not known which of them has stated the price. 
This is how many of the scholars interpreted the Prophet’s prohibition on doing two transactions in one. 
Al-Tirmidhi (1152) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade two transactions in one. This was classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 985. 
Al-Tirmidhi said: this is what the scholars based their views on. Some scholars interpreted it by saying that two transactions in one means that the seller says, “I will sell you this garment for ten in cash or for twenty in installments, but when they part they have not agreed on either of the transactions. If they part having agreed on one of them, there is nothing wrong with that, if the contract is based on one of them. 
Al-Nasaa’i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Two transactions in one means that a person says, “I will sell you this product for one hundred dirhams in cash or for two hundred dirhams in installments.” 
Al-Shawkaani said in Nayl al-Awtaar: The reason why two transactions in one is forbidden is that the price is not fixed because one thing is sold for two prices.

What is your opinion about selling a car of ten thousand in cash or twelve thousand in installments? 
They replied: 
If a person sells a car to another for ten thousand riyals, for example, if he pays cash, or for twelve thousand riyals if payment is deferred, and they part after the transaction is made without having agreed on either of the two options – the cash price or the price for delayed payment – this transaction is not permissible and it is not valid, because of the ambiguity concerning the final transaction and whether the price is to be paid now or later. This is how many of the scholars have understood the Prophet’s prohibition on making two transactions in one. This was narrated by Ahmad, al-Nasaa’i and al-Tirmidhi, and classed as saheeh by the latter. But if they agree before they separate  upon the price and one of the methods of payment, either the price in cash or the price if payment is deferred, and they separate having agreed upon the specific details, then the transaction is permissible and is valid because the price and conditions are known.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 13/192 )
In another question: 
If the vendor says, “This product costs ten riyals if payment is deferred and five riyals if paid in cash, what is the ruling on that? 
The Committee replied: 
If the situation is as you described, then the transaction is not permissible, because it is a kind of two transactions in one. It was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade two transactions in one, because that involves ambiguity that may lead to conflicts and disputes.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah, 13/197)
Among the decisions of the Fiqh Council is the following: 
It is permissible to increase the price for deferred payment as opposed to immediate payment. It is also permissible to state the price if paid in cash and another price if payment is made in installments at known times. But the transaction is not valid unless the two parties decide as to whether this is to be paid in cash or paid later. If there is some confusion as to whether the payment is to be in cash or paid later, then there is no firm agreement on one particular price, so this is not permissible according to sharee‘ah.

13724,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13724,Ruling on selling silver riyals for paper riyals at different rates,What is the ruling on selling silver riyals for paper riyals at different rates?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.There is some confusion concerning this 
    matter. Some modern scholars were certain that this is permissible, because paper money is something other than silver. Others said that it is 
    haraam, because paper money is currency that is common among people, and it has taken the place of silver, so it comes under the same rulings.  As 
    for my own view, at present I am not sure of either opinion, but I think that to be on the safe side it is better not to do that, because the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt.” And he 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever keeps away from ambiguous matters is protecting his religion and his honour.” And 
    he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Righteousness is a good attitude and sin is that which makes you uncomfortable and you 
    do not want people to see you doing it.”
So in order to be on the safe side it is 
    better to sell silver coins for something else, such as gold etc, then buy paper money with that. If the one who has paper money wants to buy 
    silver coins he should sell the paper for gold etc., then use that to buy the silver coins he wants.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat li’l-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 6/400"

Using them is haram even if the user is certain that he will pay the bank within the time limit. 
Credit cards are haram because the bank lends money to the user in return for interest, and this interest is the price of the annual subscription to the credit card, as well as other interest charges which are to be paid to the bank if the user is late in paying . 
The cost of the card is a kind of riba which the user pays to the bank, and this riba is paid by the user whether he pays on time or not.  
Also, the user enters into a contract with the bank which means that he is obliged to pay interest if he delays payment. This is also haram, because it is not permissible for a Muslim to commit himself to doing something that Allah has forbidden. 
The user may think that he can pay up on time, but then something happens to him that prevents him from doing so, so he pays riba to the bank. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning this kind of contract: 
“A contract of this type is not permissible, because it involves riba which is the price of the card, and it also means committing to pay interest if payment is delayed.” 
In another fatwa he said: 
“This transaction is haram, because the one who enters into it commits himself to paying riba if he does not pay on time. This is an invalid commitment, even if he believes or thinks it most likely that he will pay it before the time is up, because circumstances may change and he may not be able to pay it off. This is a matter that is in the future, and no one knows what will happen to him in the future. So dealings of this type are haram.”

Fasting after 15th Shaban: Permissible?


Why is it not allowed to fast after the 15th of Sha’ban?","Praise be to Allah.Hadiths that prohibit fasting after 15th of Sha’ban
Abu Dawud (3237), al-Tirmidhi (738) and Ibn Majah (1651) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Sha’ban is half over, do not fast.” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 590. 
This hadith indicates that it is not allowed to fast after halfway through Sha’ban, i.e., starting from the sixteenth day of the month. 
Hadiths that allow fasting after 15th of Sha’ban
But there are reports that indicate that it is permissible to fast at this time. For example: 
Al-Bukhari (1914) and Muslim (1082) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not anticipate Ramadan by fasting one or two days before it begins, but if a man habitually fasts, then let him fast.” 
This indicates that fasting after halfway through Sha’ban is permissible for someone who has the habit of fasting, such as a man who regularly fasts on Mondays and Thursdays, or who fasts alternate days, and the like. 
Al-Bukhari (1970) and Muslim (1156) narrated that ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fast all of Sha’ban, he used to fast Sha’ban except a few days.” This version was narrated by Muslim. 
Al-Nawawi said: In the words, “He used to fast all of Sha’ban, he used to fast Sha’ban except a few days” the second phrase explains the first, and indicates that the word “all” means “most of”. 
This hadith indicates that it is permissible to fast after halfway through Sha’ban , but only for those who are continuing after fasting before halfway through the month. The Shafi’is followed all of these ahadith and said: 
Fasting after 15th Shaban: Permissible?
It is not permissible to fast after halfway through Sha’ban except for those who have a habitual pattern of fasting, or who are continuing after fasting before halfway through the month. 
According to most of the scholars, the prohibition here means that it is haram. 
See al-Majmu’, 6/399-400; Fath al-Bari, 4/129 
Some, such as al-Ruyani, suggested that the prohibition here is to be understood as meaning that it is makruh, not haram. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Riyad al-Salihin (p. 412): 
“Chapter on the prohibition on anticipating Ramadan by fasting after halfway through Sha’ban, except for one who is continuing after fasting before halfway through the month or who has a regular pattern of fasting such as fasting on Mondays and Thursdays”. 
The majority of scholars are of the view that the hadith which forbids fasting after halfway through Sha’ban is da’if (weak), and based on that they said that it is not makruh to fast after halfway through Sha’ban. 
Al-Hafiz said: The majority of scholars said that it is permissible to observe voluntary fasts after halfway through Sha’ban and they regarded the hadith concerning that as da’if. Ahmad and Ibn Ma'in said that it is munkar. (From Fath al-Bari). Among those who classed it as da’if were al-Bayhaqi and al-Tahhawi. 
Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni that Imam Ahmad said concerning this hadith: 
It is not sound. We asked ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Mahdi about it and he did not class it as sahih, and he did not narrate it to me. He used to avoid talking about this hadith. Ahmad said: al-‘Ala is thiqah and none of his ahadith are regarded as munkar apart from this one. 
The al-‘Ala referred to here is al-‘Ala ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman who narrated this hadith from his father from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him). 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) responded in Tahdhib al-Sunan to those who classed this hadith as da’if and said that this hadith is sahih according to the conditions of Muslim. Even though al-‘Ala is the only one who narrated this hadith, that is not regarded as detrimental to the hadith, because al-‘Ala is thiqah; in his Sahih, Muslim narrated a number of ahadith from him, from his father from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him). Many Sunnahs are narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) only through one person who is thiqah, but they have been accepted and followed by the ummah. 
Then he said: 
With regard to those who think that there is a contradiction between this hadith and the ahadith which speak of fasting in Sha’ban, there is no contradiction. Those ahadith speak of fasting half of it along with the previous half, and of habitual fasting during the second half of the month, whereas the hadith of al-‘Ala speaks of the prohibition on fasting deliberately only after the month is halfway over, not about fasts that a person observes regularly or that are a continuation after fasting during the first part of the month. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the hadith which says that fasting after halfway through Sha’ban is not allowed. He said: 
“This is a sahih hadith as Shaykh Nasir al-Din al-Albani said. What is meant is that it is not allowed to start fasting after halfway through the month. But if a person fasts most or all of the month, then he is following the Sunnah.” (Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 15/385). 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said in his commentary on Riyad al-Salihin (3/394): 
“Even if the hadith is sahih, the prohibition in it does not mean that this is haram, rather it is simply makruh, as some of the scholars have understood it to mean. But whoever has the habit of fasting regularly should fast, even if it is after halfway through Sha’ban.” 
In conclusion, it is not allowed to fast during the second half of Sha’ban, and that is either makruh or haram, except for the one who has the habit of fasting regularly or who is continuing after fasting during the first half of Sha’ban. And Allaah knows best. 
Why is it not allowed to fast after the 15th of Sha’ban?
The reason for this prohibition is that continually fasting may make a person too weak to fast in Ramadan. 
If it is said that if he fasts from the beginning of the month he will become even weaker, the response is that whoever fasts from the beginning of Sha’ban will have gotten used to fasting so it will be less difficult for him to fast. 
Al-Qari said: The prohibition here means that it is disliked, as a mercy to this ummah lest they become too weak to fulfil their duty of fasting during Ramadan in an energetic fashion. But those who fast all of Sha’ban will become used to fasting so it will not be difficult for them.

    wrong with selling them and making images of these things which people may need and which are inanimate. But making pictures of animate beings, 
    whether humans, animals or birds, is not permissible unless that is for a necessary purpose, such as making pictures that people need, such as

This is like a person selling a sword or knife etc., which may be used for good or for evil. The sin is on the one who uses it for evil purposes.

Some of them are proud and arrogant although they understand the ruling, and others are ignorant of the ruling. What is your advice to them?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.What every Muslim must do is not to rely on customs; rather he should refer the matter to the pure sharee’ah. Whatever Islam approves of is permissible and whatever it does not approve of, he should not do it. The fact that people are accustomed to a thing does not constitute evidence that it is permissible. All the customs that people may have in their cities or tribes should be referred to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Whatever Allah and His Messenger have permitted is permissible, and whatever Allah has forbidden must be given up, even if it is the people’s custom. If the people are accustomed to being careless concerning the matter of khulwah (being alone with a non-mahram member of the opposite sex) or of women uncovering their faces in front of non-mahrams, these are false customs which must be given up. Similarly if people are accustomed to adultery, homosexuality and drinking alcohol, they must give up these things. What is customary does not count as proof, rather sharee’ah comes above all things, so the one whom Allah has guided to Islam has to keep away from that which Allah has forbidden of alcohol, adultery, theft, disobedience towards parents, severing the ties of kinship and everything that Allah has forbidden, and he must adhere to that which Allah has enjoined. 
Similarly the family must respect the command of Allah and His Messenger, and keep away from that which Allah and His Messenger have forbidden. If it is their custom for their women folk to appear in front of non-mahrams or to be alone with a non-mahram, they must give up those practices. 
A woman should not uncover her face or anything else in front of her cousin, her sister’s husband, or her husband’s brothers or uncles (paternal or maternal). Rather she must observe hijab and cover her face and head and entire body in front of any non-mahram. With regard to speaking, there is nothing wrong with that, such as returning the greeting of salaam or initiating it, so long as she observes hijab and avoids being alone with any non-mahram, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts” [al-Ahzaab 33:53] 
“O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women. If you keep your duty (to Allah), then be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery) should be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner” [al-Ahzaab 33:32]
Allah forbade the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to be soft in speech, i.e., to speak in a soft and alluring tone that might give hope to the one in whose heart is a disease, i.e., the disease of desire and make him think that she is easy and has no objections. Rather she should speak in a moderate tone that is neither too harsh nor too soft. And Allah tells us that hijab is purer for the hearts of everyone. 
And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed. And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Ahzaab 33:59]
The jilbab (cloak, veil) is a garment which covers the head and body; the woman puts it over her head and covers her body with it, wearing it over her clothes. And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent (like both eyes for necessity to see the way, or outer palms of hands or one eye or dress like veil, gloves, headcover, apron), and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms) and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband’s fathers, or their sons, or their husband’s sons, or their brothers or their brother’s sons, or their sister’s sons, or their (Muslim) women (i.e. their sisters in Islam), or the (female) slaves whom their right hands possess, or old male servants who lack vigour, or small children who have no sense of feminine sex…” [al-Noor 24:31]
With regard to those mentioned in this verse, there is nothing wrong with a woman showing her adornment to them. 
So all Muslim women must fear Allah and avoid that which Allah has forbidden to them of showing their adornment to anyone other than those to whom Allah has permitted them to show it.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Li’l-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 6/406"

Reconciling between the hadiths about the Prophet’s fasting in Sha’ban


Why is it recommended to fast a great deal during Sha’ban?","Praise be to Allah.Is it sunnah to fast the whole month of Sha’ban?
It is mustahabb to fast a great deal in the month of Sha’ban . 
The Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to fast the whole of Sha’ban. 
Ahmad (26022), Abu Dawud (2336), al-Nasai (2175) and Ibn Majah (1648) narrated that Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “I never saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fast two consecutive months apart from the fact that he used to join Sha’ban and Ramadan.” 
According to a version narrated by Abu Dawud: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) never used to fast any complete month in the year, apart from Sha’ban, which he used to join to Ramadan .” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 2048. 
The apparent meaning of this hadith is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fast the entire month of Sha’ban. 
But it was also narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fast all of Sha’ban apart from a few days . 
Muslim (1156) narrated that Abu Salamah said: “I asked ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) about the fasting of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and she said: ‘He used to fast until we thought that he would always fast, then he would not fast until we thought that he would always not fast, but I never saw him fast in any month more than he fasted in Sha’ban. He used to fast all of Sha’ban, and he used to fast all of Sha’ban apart from a few days.’”
Reconciling between the hadiths about the Prophet’s fasting in Sha’ban
The scholars differed as to the way of reconciling between these hadiths. 
Some of them said that this had to do with differences of time – in some years the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fasted all of Sha’ban, and in other years he fasted all of that month apart from a few days. This was the view favoured by Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him). See Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 15/416. 
Others said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) never fasted any month in full apart from Ramadan, and they interpreted the hadith of Umm Salamah as meaning that he fasted all of Sha’ban apart from a few days. They said that this is possible from a linguistic point of view, that if a man fasts for most of a month it may be said that he fasted the whole month. 
Al-Hafiz said: 
“The hadith of ‘Aishah explains what was said in the hadith of Umm Salamah, which says that he did not fast any month of the year in full apart from Sha’ban which he used to join to Ramadan; this means that he used to fast most of it. Al-Tirmidhi narrated that Ibn al-Mubarak said: It is possible in the language of the Arabs, if a person fasts most of a month, to say that he fasted the whole month…” 
Al-Tibi said: “It may be interpreted as meaning that he used to fast all of Sha’ban sometimes and most of Sha’ban at other times, lest people think that it is obligatory to fast the entire month, like Ramadan.” 
Then al-Hafiz said: The former is the correct view.”
In other words, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not fast all of Sha’ban. He quoted as evidence for that the report narrated by Muslim (746) from ‘Aishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) who said: “I do not know that the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited the entire Quran in one night, or spent an entire night in prayer until dawn, or fasted an entire month apart from Ramadan.” 
And he quoted the report narrated by al-Bukhari (1971) and Muslim (1157) from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) never fasted any month in full apart from Ramadan.” 
Al-Sindi said in his commentary on the hadith of Umm Salamah: 
“He joined Sha’ban to Ramadan” means that he fasted them both together. The apparent meaning is that he fasted all of Sha’ban… but there are reports which indicate something different. Hence it is to be understood as meaning that he used to fast most of it, so it was as if he fasted all of it and joined it to Ramadan.” 
Why is it recommended to fast a great deal during Sha’ban?
If it is asked, what is the reason for fasting a great deal during Sha’ban ? The answer is: 
Al-Hafiz said: 
“The reason is explained in the report narrated by al-Nasai and Abu Dawud, and classed as sahih by Ibn Khuzaymah, according to which Usamah ibn Zayd said: “I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, I do not see you fasting in any month more than in Sha’ban.’ He said, ‘That is a month concerning which many people are heedless, between Rajab and Ramadan. It is the month is which people’s deeds are taken up to the Lord of the Worlds, and I would like my deeds to be taken up whilst I am fasting.’” (Classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih al-Nasai, 2221)

""Whoever taunts a brother (Muslim) with a sin (which the Muslim has committed), will not die until he the taunter) commits the same sin.""
Could you please xplain this Hadith in further detail?",,,"Praise be to Allah.This hadith was narrated by al-Tirmidhi, (Kitaab Sifat al-Qiyaamah wa’l-Wara’, 2429), where the wording is,  “Whoever shames his brother for a sin will not die until he does it too.” 
Shaykh al-Albaani described this hadith in Da’eef al-Jaami’ (5710) as mawdoo’ (fabricated). 
If a hadith is da’eef (weak) and mawdoo’ (fabricated), it cannot be taken as a basis for rulings or be acted upon. 
With regard to the meaning of the hadith, Shaykh al-Mubaarakfoori said:
“ ‘Whoever shames’ means whoever criticizes or condemns. ‘his brother’ means his brother in faith. ‘For a sin’ means one from which he has repented, according to the way in which Imaam Ahmad explained it. ‘will not die’ – the subject of this verb is ‘whoever’. ‘Until he does it too’ means, the sin for which he criticizes his brother. It is as if the one who criticizes his brother will be forsaken by Allah until he commits the sin for which he criticized his brother, if that criticism was accompanied by self-admiration for being free of that sin.” 
(Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi, 7/173) 
The fact that this hadith is da’eef (weak) does not mean that it is permissible to criticize those who have fallen into sin, for those who fall into sin are of different types. 
Some of them repent and turn back to their Lord, or else the punishment (hadd) is carried out on them. So it is not permissible to criticize them because their souls have been purified by their repentance or the punishment. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who repents from sin is like one who has never sinned.” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 4240; classed as saheeh by al-Busayri in al-Zawaa’id, commentary on Sunan Ibn Maajah). 
Imam Ahmad said that the punishment mentioned in the hadith is for the one who criticizes a person who has repented from his sin, as al-Tirmidhi narrated from him.  After narrating this hadith, he said: Ahmad said: from a sin from which he has repented. 
Some of them commit sin but they do not do it openly. Anyone who comes to know of that has to advise the person and cover his faults. 
And some of them commit sin openly. They should also be advised, and others should be warned against them to whatever extent is appropriate. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
It may be that what he meant is that your criticizing your brother for his sin is an even greater sin than his, because it means that you feel pride in your obedience and you are praising yourself for that, and claiming to be free from sin, whereas your brother has fallen into sin. But it may be that his feeling humble because of his sin and what has happened to him, such as his feeling humble and submissive, thinking less of himself, ridding himself of pious pretensions, arrogance and self-admiration, standing before Allah with his head bowed, his gaze lowered and his heart broken – it may be that all of that is better for him than your feeling proud of your obedience, thinking that you are doing much good, believing that by doing so you are important, and reminding Allah and mankind of that. 
How close this sinner is to the mercy of Allah, and how close this conceited one is to the wrath of Allah! A sin that leads to humility is more beloved to Him than an act of obedience which fills a person with conceit. If you sleep all night then wake up feeling regret (for not having prayed qiyaam al-layl), that may be better for you than if you were to pray all night and wake up in the morning filled with self-admiration. For the deeds of the one who admires himself are not accepted. Perhaps your laughing whilst admitting to shortcomings is better than your weeping with piety but being filled with conceit. The groaning of the sinners is more beloved to Allah than the tasbeeh of the conceited. It may be that by means of this sin, Allah has caused him to drink the medicine that will cure a fatal disease which you also have, but you do not realize it. Allah has reason for what He does to both those who are obedient and those who sin, which are known to no-one except Him, and which no one recognizes except those who have insight, and then only within the limits of human understanding; beyond that there are reasons which are not even known to the honourable scribes (i.e., the recording angels). The Prophet said: “If the slave woman of any one of you commits adultery, let him carry out the punishment on her and not criticize.” And Yoosuf (peace be upon him) said: “No reproach on you this day” [Yoosuf 12:92 – interpretation of the meaning]. For the scale is in the hand of Allah, and the ruling is His. The point is to carry out the punishment (prescribed by Allah) and not to shame and criticize. No one feels safe from what has been decreed for them and from the power of His decree except those who are ignorant of Allah. Allah said to the one who had more knowledge of Him than anyone else and was closer to Him: “And had We not made you stand firm, you would nearly have inclined to them a little”[al-Israa’ 17:74 – interpretation of the meaning]. And Yoosuf said: “Unless You turn away their plot from me, I will feel inclined towards them and be one (of those who commit sin and deserve blame or those who do deeds) of the ignorant”[Yoosuf 12:33 – interpretation of the meaning]. One of the ways in which the Messenger of Allah used to swear was “No, by the One who turns hearts.” And he said, “There is no heart which is not between two of the fingers of the Most Merciful. If He wills He guides it aright and if He wills He sends it astray.” Then he said, “O Allah, the one Who turns hearts over, make our hearts steadfast in adhering to Your religion. O Allah, musrif al-Quloob, sirf our hearts to obey You.”

The matter has gone so far that some of them even buy sets of sanitary equipment such as bathroom taps and fixtures all made of pure gold, and they do not pay zakah on this gold or pay any attention to its value. It is known that this is forbidden. What is your view on that? Is it possible to forbid the sale of such things to Muslims who are unaware of the ruling? May Allah bless you.","It is not permissible for Muslims to use gold and silver as vessels, whether for eating or drinking. The same applies to things used for Wudu and Ghusl.","Using vessels of gold and silver in Islam


How to dispose of vessels of gold and silver","Praise be to Allah.Using vessels of gold and silver in Islam
Vessels of gold and silver are forbidden according to the texts of Islam and according to scholarly consensus. 
It was proven that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not drink from vessels of gold and silver; do not eat from plates of gold and silver , because they are for them [the disbelievers] in this world and for you in the Hereafter.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him))
And it was proven that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever eats and drinks from vessels of gold and silver, is taking fire from Hell into his belly.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with him); this version was narrated by Muslim)
It is not permissible to use gold and silver as vessels , whether for eating or drinking. The same applies to things used for Wudu and Ghusl. All of that is prohibited according to the Hadith of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
These things should not be sold so that Muslims will not use them. Allah has forbidden us to use them so they should not be used for drinking, eating or any other purpose. It is not permissible to use them in spoons, coffee cups or teacups; all of that is forbidden, because these are kinds of vessels. 
So the Muslim should avoid that which Allah has forbidden and keep away from extravagance and wasting wealth. If he has ample wealth then there are poor people to whom he can give charity; there are Mujahidin fighting for the sake of Allah to whom he can donate. He should give in charity, not fool about with his wealth. There are those who need his wealth.  
How to dispose of vessels of gold and silver
So the believer must dispose of his wealth in charitable ways , such as giving to the poor and needy, in building and maintaining mosques and schools, repairing roads and bridges, helping the Mujahidin and poor migrants, and other ways, such as paying off the debts of those who are in dire straits, and helping those who cannot afford to get married to do so. These are all good things on which we are encouraged to spend. 
As for wasting wealth by buying vessels, spoons, cups or bathroom fixtures of gold and silver, and the like, all of that is reprehensible and we should avoid that and warn others against it. Whoever has any position of status in countries where such things are done, such as scholars and rulers, should denounce that and prevent the extravagant from indulging in such things.

The gold cards cost 548 riyals and the silver cards cost 245 riyals. This amount is paid to the bank annually by the person who uses the Credit card, like an annual subscription. 

The way these cards are used is that the card allows the bearer to withdraw as much money as he wants from the bank’s branches as a loan, and he has to repay the same amount of money within a period not exceeding fifty-four days. If he does not pay it back within the period stated, the bank will charge interest of 1.95 riyals for each hundred riyals of money withdrawn. The bank also charges 3.50 riyals for every hundred riyals of cash withdrawn by the carrier of the card, or a minimum of 45 riyals for every cash withdrawal. 

The carrier of this card is also entitled to buy products in stores that the bank deals with, without paying any cash, and it becomes a loan from the bank. If he delays paying off the cost of what he has bought for more than fifty-four days, they will charge 1.95 riyals for every hundred of the price of the products purchased from the stores that the bank deals with. 

What is the ruling on using these cards and subscribing annually to the bank in order to use these cards?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This question was put to the Standing 
    Committee, who replied: 
If the credit card is as described, then it 
    is a new kind of riba-based transaction and of consuming people’s wealth unlawfully, making them fall into sin and contaminating their earnings 
    and dealings. It comes under the same rulings as the riba of the Jaahiliyyah which is forbidden in sharee’ah. (Either you pay it off at the 
    appointed time or you increase the amount). Hence it is not permissible to issue such cards or to use them. And Allaah is the Source of strength.

Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy 
    on him) was asked about this and he said:

1. Why is it that having concubines is not haram? 

2. Can other muslims have concubines?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Allaah is Most Wise in the laws that He decrees for His 
    slaves, but this wisdom is only apparent to those who seek it and believe 
    that Allaah is All Wise, and looks at the interests that are served by the 
    laws of Allaah which no man can see unless he ponders the matter, especially 
    when there are those who attack those laws because they go against what they 
    think are right and wise. 

    With regard to your question about it being permissible for a 
    master to be intimate with his slave woman, the answer is that that is 
    because Allaah has permitted it. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, 
    from illegal sexual acts)

    6. Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their 
    right hands possess, for then, they are free from blame”

    [al-Mu’minoon 23:6; al-Ma’aarij 70:30]
That is subject to the 
    condition that he has acquired her in a proper manner, and that this slave 
    woman has not been given by her master in marriage to another man to whom 
    she is still married. The reason why this is permitted is that this slave 
    woman belongs to him, either because he has paid money to buy her or he has 
    fought for the sake of Allaah (and acquired her among the war booty). 
Shaykh al-Shanqeeti (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him) said: The reason for which people may be taken as 
    slaves is if they are kaafirs who are waging war against Allaah and His 
    Messenger. If Allaah grants victory to the mujaahid Muslims, who are 
    offering their souls, their wealth and all their resources and everything 
    that Allaah has given them so that the word of Allaah might prevail over the 
    kuffaar, then these kuffaar may become slaves, unless the imam chooses to 
    let them go or to ransom them if that serves the interests of the Muslims. 

    Adwa’ al-Bayaan, 3/387 

    Shaykh al-Shanqeeti (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    If it is said: If the slave is a Muslim, how can he be kept 
    as a slave if the reason for which people may be taken as slaves is if they 
    are kaafirs who are waging war against Allaah and His Messenger? The answer 
    is that the basic principle which is well known to the scholars and all wise 
    people is that a right that is already established by shar’i means cannot be 
    superceded by rights that are established later on. 

    When the Muslims take prisoners of war, they are given the 
    right to enslave them by the law of the Creator of all, and He is the 
    All-Wise, All-Aware. If this right is established, then the slave becomes a 
    Muslim after that, his right to be freed from slavery because of his Islam 
    is superceded by the right of the mujaahid whose right to enslave him took 
    effect before he was a Muslim. It is not just or fair to waive the former 
    right because of a latter right, as is well known to all wise people. 

    Yes, it is good for the owner to set him free if he becomes 
    Muslim, and Islam enjoins that and encourages it, and opens the door to 
    doing so in many ways – he is referring to the fact that Allaah has decreed 
    that when expiation takes the form of freeing a slave, the slave in question 
    should be a Muslim –  

    Glory be to the All Wise, All Aware: “And the Word of your 
    Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice. None can change His Words. 
    And He is the All‑Hearer, the All‑Knower” [al-An’aam 6:115]. 
“In truth” means in what 
    He has told us; “in justice” means in His rulings. 

    Undoubtedly that justice includes owning slaves and other 
    rulings that are mentioned in the Qur’aan. 

    Adwa’ al-Bayaan, 3/389. 
With regard to Muslims 
    owning slaves, he should be very careful to establish that those who are 
    bought or sold now are indeed slaves, because Islam has limited the sources 
    of slaves which were many before the coming of Muhammad  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), and has allowed only one source, which is 
    kaafir prisoners of war, when the kuffaar are fighting the Muslims. There is 
    no other way in which they may be enslaved except those who are captured as 
    a result of fighting between kaffirs and Muslims, or their children.   See

          The one who has more than one wife has to treat all his

          of his time, i.e., he must give each wife a day and a night, and he 
          must stay with her on that night. 
 
          Al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “The

          to be fair in doing so. (al-Umm, 5/158). And he said: I do not

          free [i.e., not slaves], whether they are Muslims or from among the 
          People of the Book [i.e., Jewish or Christian]. If he does not treat 
          them equally, then he has disobeyed Allaah and he has to make it up 
          to the one whom he wronged. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the 
          Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever has two wives 
          and leans towards (i.e. favours) one of them (over the other), will 
          come on the Day of Resurrection with half of his body leaning.” However 
          there is some dispute concerning its isnaad. (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 
          2/242; al-Tirmidhi, 3/447; al-Nasaa’i, 7/64; Ibn Maajah, 1/633; classed

          in Irwaa’ al-Ghaleel, 7/80). 
 
          What is meant by this “leaning” is favouring in terms 
          of actions; a man will not be taken to task for the inclination of his 
          heart if he treats (his wives) equally in practical terms. Allaah says 
          (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “You will never be able to do perfect justice between 
          wives even if it is your ardent desire, so do not incline too much to 
          one of them…”
 
          [al-Nisaa’ 4:129]
 
          What this means is that you will never be able to treat 
          them equally in your heart, so do not incline too much towards one of 
          them, i.e., do not make your actions follow your whims and desires. 
          
 
          (Sharh al-Sunnah, 9/150-151) 
 
          Ibn Hazam (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Treating 
          co-wives equally is obligatory, most of all sharing one’s nights between 
          them. 
 
          (al-Muhalla, 9/175) 
 
          Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on 
          him) said: He has to treat his wives fairly according to the consensus 
          of the Muslims. In the four Sunans it was narrated from Abu Hurayrah 
          that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever has two wives…” 
          He has to be fair in his division of time between them. So if he stays 
          with one of them for one night, or two or three, he should stay with 
          the other for the same number of nights, and he should not give preference 
          to one of them in his sharing of his time.
 
          (Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 32/269) 
 
          Al-‘Ayni said, commenting on the hadeeth, “Whoever has 
          two wives…”: It was said that what was meant was that half of his body 
          would be leaning in a real sense, or that he would have no acceptable 
          excuse for favouring one wife over the other. The apparent meaning is 
          that this is in the real sense. This is indicated by the report of Abu 
          Dawood, “with half of his body leaning.” The punishment fits the crime, 
          because he did not treat them fairly or he deviated from what is right. 
          Because of his being unfair and favouring one of them, his punishment 
          is that he will come before the witnesses on the Day of Resurrection 
          with one half of his body leaning.
 
          (‘Umdat al-Qaari’, 20/199. See also al-Mabsoot, 
          5/217). 
 
          Al-Shawkaani also understood this to mean that it is 
          obligatory (to treat co-wives fairly). See al-Sayl al-Jiwaar, 
          2/301; Nayl al-Awtaar, 6/216 
 
          Ibn Qudaamah al-Maqdisi (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
          said: We know of no dispute among the scholars concerning the fact that 
          it is obligatory to treat co-wives equally when sharing one’s time between 
          them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “and 
          live with them honourably” [al-Nisaa’ 4:19], 
          but favouring one of them is not honourable.

We ask Allah Almighty to increase you in faith and to make you content with the truth. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
We do not know anything (to disallow) cutting women’s hair . What is forbidden is shaving it. You should not shave your hair but you may cut it and reduce its length or volume; we know of nothing wrong with that. But that should be done in a proper manner which will please you and your husband. 
You should come to some agreement with him on a kind of haircut that does not resemble non-Muslim women, because if you leave it long, it will be a lot of trouble to wash it and comb it.
So if the hair is very long or thick, and the woman cuts it to reduce its length or volume, that doesn’t matter. Cutting some of it will make it more beautiful, which will please both the woman and her husband. So we do not know of any reason to disallow that. But shaving it altogether is not permissible, except in the case of sickness. And Allah is the Source of strength.” (Fatawa al-Marah al-Muslimah, part 2, p. 515)

This prohibition also applies to haircuts which are named after non-Muslim women or animals, like the “Diana” cut, named after a non-Muslim woman, or the “lion” cut or “mouse” cut, because it is haram to imitate the disbelievers or to imitate animals, and because that involves fooling about with a woman’s hair which is part of her beauty.” (Fatawa al-Marah al-Muslimah, 2/516,517) 
Is removing facial hair haram? 
Shaykh Muhammad al-Salih ibn ‘Uthaymin said: 
“With regard to hair which is abnormal, because it grows in places where hair does not usually grow, such as a woman having a moustache or hair growing on her cheeks, there is nothing wrong with removing this , because it is abnormal and is disfiguring to the woman.” 
The Standing Committee was asked about women removing facial hair , and they replied as follows: 
“It is OK for a woman to remove hair on the upper lip, thighs, calves and arms. This is not the same as plucking (eyebrows), which is forbidden.” (‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz, ‘Abd al-Razzaq ‘Afifi, ‘Abd-Allah ibn Ghadyyan, ‘Abd-Allah ibn Qa’ud, Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 5/194, 195) 
The Standing Committee was also asked: 
What is the ruling on a woman removing hair from her body; if it is permissible, then who is allowed to do that for her? 
They answered: 
“It is permissible for her (to remove) everything except her eyebrows and the hair on her head; it is not permissible for her to remove those, or to remove anything from the eyebrows whether by shaving or any other means. She, her husband or one of her mahrams may do that for her, with regard to the parts of the body that they are permitted to see; or another woman may do that, with regard to the parts of the body that she is permitted to see.” (‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz, ‘Abd al-Razzaq ‘Afifi, ‘Abd-Allah ibn Ghadyyan, ‘Abd-Allah ibn Qa’ud, Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 5/194)
The hair of the private parts and the thighs may not be seen by either another woman or a mahram. 
Is plucking eyebrows haram? 
It is forbidden for a woman to remove her eyebrows or part of them by any means, whether it be by shaving, cutting or using a depilatory substance, because this constitutes the plucking for which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who does it, i.e., the woman who plucks all or part of her eyebrows , claiming that it is for the purpose of beautification, or the woman who does that for her. This is changing the creation of Allah which the Shaytan promised to enjoin upon the sons of Adam. (See also al-Fatawa al-Jami’ah li’l-Marah al-Muslimah, part 3, p. 877-879)",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

3- Why is it that Muslim people aren't allowed to date?",,,"Praise be to Allah.With regard to women, they have the same responsibilities as men; they have to call people to Allaah as much as they can, strive to call women and warn them against imitating the kuffaar, call them to acquire knowledge of Islam and to remember and worship Allaah, warn them against major and minor sins, and be a good example to others. This applies in all places where women meet. 
With regard to children under the age of ten, their parents are responsible for striving to give them a good upbringing; if they make mistakes or do something that is haraam, then the sin is on the parents, because they should warn them to keep away from drugs, smoking and other things so that they will grow up healthy and sound. 
Evil spirits are the spirits of the devils, and there are also devils among mankind who have been brought up to love evil and evildoers. They are the ones whose spirits emanate from their bodies and cause harm by means of the evil eye used against those whom they wish to harm. The jinn and the devils are evil and harmful spirits who may cause a great deal of harm to those who rely on them and trust them.  But if a person is cautious about their evil, and seeks refuge with Allaah from the devils of mankind and the jinn, then Allaah will protect him and keep him safe from their evil. 
Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Jibreen 
It is not permissible for a Muslim man to date a non-mahram woman and go out with her, because Allaah has forbidden the believers to do that as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Made lawful to you this day are At‑Tayyibaat [all kinds of Halaal (lawful) foods, which Allaah has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]. The food (slaughtered cattle, eatable animals) of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them. (Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time when you have given their due Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage), desiring chastity (i.e. taking them in legal wedlock) not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends. And whosoever disbelieves in Faith, [i.e. in the Oneness of Allaah and in all the other Articles of Faith i.e. His (Allaah’s) Angels, His Holy Books, His Messengers, the Day of Resurrection and Al‑Qadar (Divine Preordainments)], then fruitless is his work; and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers”
[al-Maa'idah 5:5]
And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts”
[al-Ahzaab 33:53]
 And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No man is ever alone with a (non-mahram) women but the Shaytaan is the third one present.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2165; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 1758)

13749,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13749,Is it permissible for a grandmother to make a will in favour of her grandchildren when her sons are still alive?,"I have a question regarding specific rules of inheritance.  

1-My mother is divorced and has remarried.  The money that she will leave on to her relatives she obtained as a result of her first marriage, not her second.  

2- She has a son (me, her only living child from her first marriage), a husband, two grandchildren, and several brothers and sisters, one of whom lives in the same country (USA) as her.  

3- From my understanding of the rules of inheritance, she has the right to distribute up to 1/3 (or less) in any Islamically acceptable way that she wishes.  

4- After the first 1/3 (or less) is distributed, the remainder according to my knowledge is to be distributed as 1/2 to the son, and 1/4 to her current husband. Is this correct?  

5- Are there any other relatives who have rights of inheritance upon her?  

6- She wanted to simply divide her assets as 1/2 to me and 1/2 to her grandchildren, but I told her I wanted to make sure she did what was right in Islam, so that is why I am asking.",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          This question covers a number of topics: 
 
          1 – Those who are entitled to inheritance in this case 
          are: 
The father and mother, 
          and the husband and wife, and the sons, if there are sons, are not prevented 
          from inheriting. But each of them should take the share which is decreed 
          by Allaah.  But in the case of daughters, if there are also sons, 
          they inherit by right of descent [bi’l-ta’seeb] (The 
          word ‘by right of descent’ can be used with the sons and daughters but 
          notwith the brothers, sisters, uncles and cousins. 
          Therefore, I would think thatthe word ‘by agnation’ 
          is more suitable because it means the blood relationshipfrom the side of the father )  on 
          the basis that each male gets the equivalent of the share of two females. 
 
          In the case you mention, those who are entitled to inheritance 
          are: 
 
          The husband, who is entitled to one-quarter because there 
          is a son (a descendent who is entitled to inherit)
 
          The son, who is entitled to the remainder of the inheritance, 
          because he inherits by right of descent [ bil-ta’seeb ]
Brothers and sisters 
          are prevented from inheriting by the presence of the son, so they have 
          no right to the inheritance. 
 
          2 – Ruling on making a will in favour of an heir: 
 
          It is not permissible to make a will in favour of any 
          of the heirs (i.e., those who are entitled to inherit according to sharee’ah). 
          It was narrated in a saheeh report that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah has given 
          to each one who is entitled his rights, and there is no will in favour 
          of one who is an heir…” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2047; classed as saheeh 
          by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, no. 1722.) Shaykh Taqiy al-Deen 
          said, The ummah is unanimously agreed upon this. 
 
          Unless that will is approved by the heirs (who are entitled 
          to inherit according to sharee’ah), in which case it becomes valid; 
          it is subject to their consent. 
 
          3 – When the will is to be considered. 
 
          The will is to be considered immediately following death. 
           
 
          Al-Muwaffaq said: we do not know of any dispute among 
          the scholars concerning the fact that the will is to be considered immediately 
          following death. 
 
          See al-Mulakhkhas al-Fiqhi by al-Fawzaan, part 
          2, p. 174. 
 
          Ibn Hajar said: The (scholars) are agreed that the one 
          in whose favour the will is made is to be considered as an heir (i.e., 
          one who is entitled to inherit according to sharee’ah) on the day of 
          death. Even if one made a will in favour of a brother who is an heir 
          (i.e., one who is entitled to inherit according to sharee’ah), as he 
          does not have a son to prevent his brother from inheriting, but just 
          before he dies a son is born to him, and that son prevents his brother 
          from inheriting, then this will in favour of the brother is valid. If 
          he made a will in favour of his brother at the time when he had a son, 
          and the son died before his father, then the brother becomes entitled 
          to inherit and thus the will becomes invalid. 
 
          On this basis it is permissible for your mother to make 
          a will in favour of her two grandchildren (your two children) so long 
          as they do not have any rights of inheritance. She may also include 
          her brothers and sisters in her will, on the condition that she does 
          not give more than one-third to them, because the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “One-third, and one-third 
          is a lot.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Wasaayaa, 2538) 
 
          With regard to giving something whilst one is still alive, 
          this is a gift. See the answer to Question No. 10447",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Could you please tell me where in the Koran I might find such a refence?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly the blessing comes where Allah wills, and it comes if a person asked Allah to bless him in his wealth or provision, so He makes it blessed, or He makes the person blessed, as ‘Eesa (Jesus – peace be upon him) said. Allah says: 
“[‘Eesa (Jesus) said:] And He has made me blessed wheresoever I be”
[Maryam 19:31 – interpretation of the meaning]
And the blessing will be wherever Allah puts it, as He says concerning rain (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We send down blessed water (rain) from the sky” [Qaaf 50:9]
i.e., you gain blessing by its falling, because it makes trees and plants grow. With regard to breastfeeding, I do not remember any aayah which mentions it in conjunction with blessing in particular. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-Kareem al-Khudayr. 
 The Qur’aan encourages the mother to breastfeed her child naturally. Allah says: 
“The mothers shall give suck to their children for two whole years, (that is) for those (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling” [al-Baqarah 2:233]
 This is a command to mothers, as the scholars explained, to breastfeed their children. The scholars also mentioned that one part of breastfeeding is obligatory, which is the yellow substance (colostrum) that is produced at the beginning of breastfeeding and which is known medically to be of great benefit in building the immune system of the child etc. Undoubtedly in carrying out the commands of Allah there is great blessing.

When that is the case, their opponents look at them with awe, admiration and respect, because they know that their adherence to Islam and the true religion raises their status before Allah and enables them to take control over lands and people. So their opponents look at them with awe and respect, and fear them. But when their commitment to Islam becomes weak and they introduce innovations in their religion, then their opponents look down on them with contempt and loathing and all feelings of fear disappear. With regard to how the Muslims view themselves, they have to check on one another and look at the faults and weakness that have befallen them, and deal with them as much as possible so that their glory and power will be restored, and so that their enemies will fear them.

13759,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13759,Muslims and how others perceive them,what problems do muslims have because of how others perceive them?,,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          The Muslims have suffered persecution and harm because of how others 
          perceive them and because of their adherence to their religion, but 
          no matter how great the persecution, they cannot be humiliated in themselves 
          or made to hate Islam, rather they bear that with patience for the sake 
          of Allaah, seeking reward for that. Their Lord says (interpretation 
          of the meaning): 
 
          “So do not become weak (against your enemy), nor be 
          sad, and you will be superior (in victory) if you are indeed (true) 
          believers”
 
          [Aal ‘Imraan 3:139]
 
          With regard to what some of the kaafirs do to the Muslims, 
          it is for one of three reasons: 
 
          Either this kaafir is ignorant of Islam and its greatness, 
          and of the fact that it is the true religion, so he tries to harm the 
          Muslims because of that ignorance; 
 
          Or he knows that the Islamic religion is the true religion, 
          but he harms the Muslims out of stubbornness and arrogance; 
 
          Or he knows of the superiority of Islam and the Muslims, 
          but he does that because of envy towards Islam and its followers. 
 
          Yet despite that the Muslims believe that Islam is the 
          religion of honour and pride, and the religion of high status in this 
          world and in the Hereafter; whoever adheres to it, Allaah will raise 
          his status, and whoever turns away from it harms no one but himself. 
 
          One of the things that Islam teaches us is to be proud 
          and strong. Our Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The strong believer 
          is better and more beloved to Allaah than the weak believer, although 
          both are good.” (Narrated by Muslim, 4815). 
 
          Islam tells us that the older ones among us should show 
          mercy towards the younger ones. The Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “He is not one of 
          us who does not show mercy to our young ones and show respect to our 
          old ones.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1842; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani 
          in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 1565). 
 
          Islam commands us to be merciful and compassionate towards one another, 
          and in contrast we are to be severe and harsh against the kaafirs. Allaah 
          says, describing the Companions of our Prophet Muhammad 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): 
 
          “Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. And those who 
          are with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves”
 
          [al-Fath 48:29 – interpretation of the meaning]
 
          Our religion permits us (Muslim men) to marry Jewish 
          or Christian women, but we are not permitted to marry our daughters 
          to them (Jews or Christians), because the Jews and Christians are lower 
          in status than us, and our women are higher in status than them, and 
          one who is inferior cannot prevail over one who is superior. Islam should 
          prevail, not be prevailed over. And we believe in their Prophets but 
          they do not believe in our Prophet. 
 
          Our religion commands us to expel them from the Arabian 
          Peninsula and not to let them remain there, because the Arabian Peninsula 
          is the land of Revelation, so it is not permissible for it to be contaminated 
          by the presence of unclean kaafirs. The Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Expel the mushrikeen 
          (polytheists, pagans) from the Arabian Peninsula.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 
          2932; Muslim, 3089). 
 
          Our religion forbids us to eat from the vessel of a Jew 
          or a Christian unless we cannot find anything else. In that case it 
          is permissible for us to eat from it on condition that we wash it thoroughly. 
          The Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, when he was asked 
          about eating from the vessels of the People of the Book: “If you can 
          find any other vessel, then do not eat from them; if you cannot find 
          anything else, wash them and then eat from them.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 
          5056; Muslim, 3567 – this version was narrated by him). 
 
          Our religion forbids us to imitate the dress of the kaafirs 
          or to imitate the way they eat or any of their customs, because we are 
          superior and the kaafirs are inferior, and the one who is superior should 
          not imitate the one who is inferior. Indeed, our Prophet warned us that 
          the one who imitates the kaafirs is going to meet the same fate as them 
          in Hell, what a terrible fate! The Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates 
          a people is one of them.” (narrated by Abu Dawood, 3512. Al-Albaani 
          said concerning this hadeeth: (it is) hasan saheeh. See Saheeh Abi 
          Dawood, 3401). 
 
          Our Prophet commanded us to fight the kaafirs when we are able and to 
          attack them in their homelands and to give them three choices before 
          we enter their lands: either they become Muslim and be like us, sharing 
          our rights and duties; or they pay the jizyah (poll tax) and feel themselves 
          subdued; or they fight, in which case their wealth, women, children 
          and homes become permissible as booty for the Muslims. 
 
          Islam is a divinely-revealed religion, which connects 
          a believer to his Lord with no intermediary. So a person worships his 
          Lord whenever he wants, and calls upon Him when he wants. He is connected 
          to his Lord by ties of worship, by turning to Him and beseeching Him. 
          He does not need the intercession of priests or rabbis. Rather he turns 
          directly to Allaah, the One, the Subduer of all. 
 
          What you see nowadays of the humiliation of the Muslims 
          and the domination of the Jews and Christians over them is the result 
          of the Muslims’ negligence and failure to adhere to their religion, 
          their failure to prepare for jihad for the sake of Allaah, and their 
          love of this world which kills the love of Allaah and the Hereafter 
          in their hearts. Hence you see that the blood of the Muslims  is 
          shed and has become cheap, and their homes are destroyed and counted 
          as worthless, and their lives are counted as cheap because of their 
          weakness. Allaah indeed spoke the truth when He said (interpretation 
          of the meaning): 
 
          “And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because 
          of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much”[al-Shoora 42:30]
 
          So our humiliation and weakness are because of what we Muslims have 
          done, not because of Islam. But when we come back to our religion, our 
          glory and pride will come back to us.

This is the view of the majority of scholars, because of the hadeeth of Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) issued orders that the martyrs of Uhud should be buried with their blood and not washed. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1346) 
Rather they should not be washed, so that the traces of their martyrdom will be left on them, for it was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, no one is wounded for the sake of Allah – and Allah knows best who is wounded for His sake – but on the Day of Resurrection he will come with a colour like the colour of blood and a fragrance like the fragrance of musk.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2803; Muslim, 1876 
‘Abd-Allah ibn Tha’labah narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Leave them with their blood, for there is no wound incurred for the sake of Allah, but he will come on the Day of Resurrection bleeding with a colour like the colour of blood but its fragrance will be like the fragrance of musk.” 
Narrated by al-Nasaa’i; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 3573 
See al-Mughni ma’a al-Sharh al-Kabeer, 2/333; al-Maswoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 26/274 
If the shaheed was junub (in a state of impurity following sexual activity), the scholars differed as to whether he should be washed. The more correct view is that he should not be washed because there is no difference between one who is junub and one who is not. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not wash those who were killed at Uhud. Moreover martyrdom is an expiation for everything.    
With regard to the report that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Hanzalah was washed by the angels, even if it is saheeh, it does not prove that the shaheed should be washed by human beings, because the angels’ washing him is not something that is visible to us. The rulings for human beings cannot be compared to the rulings for the angels. What happened to Hanzalah (may Allah be pleased with him) was by way of honouring him, not be way of enjoining anything upon us. See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 5/365.",Islam Q&A
13766,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13766,"An imam leads the Muslims in prayer and they dislike him, and he knows that","An imam leads the Muslims in prayer and they dislike him, and he knows that. How should we deal with this situation?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is makrooh for a man to lead people in prayer when most of them dislike him for a justifiable reason, such as if he is lacking in religious commitment, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three whose prayers do not go any further than their ears: a runaway slave until he returns, a woman who spent the night with her husband being angry with her, and one who leads people in prayer when they dislike him.” Narrated and classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:  
If they dislike this imam for a reason that has to do with his religious commitment, such as lying, wrongdoing, ignorance, bid’ah (innovation) and so on, and they like another because his religious commitment is better, such as if he is more honest, more knowledgeable or more religiously committed, then the imam whom they like should be appointed to lead them, and that imam whom they dislike should not lead them in prayer. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three whose prayers will not go any further than their ears: a man who leads people in prayer when they dislike him, a man who does not come to pray until the time for the prayer is over, and a man who enslaves a man who has been set free.”  
And he said: 
If there is some enmity between the imam and the members of the congregation such as enmity based on whims and desires or differences of opinion, he should not lead them in a congregational prayer, because it cannot be perfected unless there is harmony between them. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not make your lines ragged lest that create disharmony among your hearts.” But if the imam is religiously committed and follows the Sunnah, and they dislike him because of that, then it is not makrooh for him to lead them in the prayer, rather they are to be blamed for disliking him. Whatever the case, there should be harmony between the imam and the people who follow him (in the prayer); they should cooperate in righteousness and piety and refrain from hatred that is based on whims and desires and devilish aims. The imam should pay attention to the rights of the people who pray behind him, and he should not be harsh with them; and the members of the congregation should pay attention to the rights of the imam, and respect him. In conclusion, each party should put up with some criticism from the other that may not befit religious commitment and chivalry, because man is bound to have some faults and shortcomings.

He answered: 
The things mentioned in this question do not have any effect on the validity of the fast; rather that is allowed. But he has to be careful not to swallow any medicine or blood. 
Similarly, the injection mentioned does not affect the validity of the fast because it is not a kind of food or drink, and the basic principle is that his fast is valid. (Ajwibah Muhimmah tata’allaq bi Arkan al-Islam). 
If you can go to the dentist in the evening, this is preferable.

13769,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13769,Prostrating to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) constitutes disbelief in Allah (kufr),"I would like to know what to do. Someone told me that when reciting dhuwa, that i have to prostrate seven times for the prophet[p.b.u.h], but i just don't know how, would you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
	Firstly, one of the things that are well known in Islam and 
	that no Muslim has any excuse for not knowing is that it is not permissible 
	to do any kind of act of worship for anyone except Allah – not to any angel 
	who is close to Him or to any Prophet who was sent. Whoever does any kind of 
	act of worship for anyone other than Allah is a mushrik (polytheist, one who 
	associates others with Allah) and a kaafir (disbeliever). The evidence for 
	that is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

	“And the mosques are for Allah (Alone), so invoke not anyone 
	along with Allah”
	[al-Jinn 72:18]. 

	Ibn Katheer said: Here Allah is commanding His slaves to 
	worship Him alone and not to call on anyone alongside Him, and not to 
	associate anyone with Him. 

	This action is a kind of exaggeration about the Messenger of 
	Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), which the Prophet (peace 
	and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned us against and forbade us to do. 
	He said: “Do not exaggerate about me as the Christians exaggerated about the 
	son of Maryam, for I am no more than His slave, so say, the slave of Allah 
	and His Messenger.” Undoubtedly this action (prostrating) is a form of 
	worship.

	(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, Ahaadeeth al-Anbiya’, 
	3189). 

	Undoubtedly this action is a kind of worship, and the Prophet 
	(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned us against following the 
	Jews and Christians in that. He said during his final illness: “May the 
	curse of Allah be upon the Jews and Christians, for they took the graves of 
	their Prophets as places of worship.” He was warning against doing what they 
	did. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Salaah, 417)

	And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) 
	warned us against standing up for him. It says in the hadeeth [referring to 
	when he led them in prayer sitting down because he was ill, and they were 
	standing, so he gestured to them to sit down]: “Just now you nearly did the 
	action of the Persians and Romans, who stand up for their kings whilst they 
	[the kings] are sitting.” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Salaah, 624) 

	And it says in the hadeeth: “Do not do as the Persians do for 
	their leaders.” This is narrated in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 7380. If this 
	is what is said about standing up for him (peace and blessings of Allah be 
	upon him), then what about prostrating for him? 

	
	Prostration in this manner is one of the most exclusive acts 
	of worship, to be done only for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. 
	Allah has commanded us to prostrate to Him alone and none other, as He says 
	(interpretation of the meaning): 

	“Prostrate yourselves not to the sun nor to the moon, but 
	prostrate yourselves to Allah Who created them, if you (really) worship Him”

	[Fussilat 41:37] 

	“So fall you down in prostration to Allah and worship Him 
	(Alone)”

	[al-Najm 53:62]. 

	
	For more information on the issue of prostration to anyone or 
	anything other than Allah, please see the answer to question no.
	229780.

	Secondly: what is prescribed in Islam is to send blessings 
	upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when making 
	du‘aa’. This is a kind of etiquette to which attention should be paid. 

	Al-Nawawi said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that it 
	is mustahabb to begin du’aa’ with praise of Allah, then to send blessings 
	upon the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and 
	to conclude the du’aa’ in like manner, as it says in the hadeeth: 

	“Whilst the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah 
	be upon him) was sitting, a man entered and prayed, then he said, ‘O Allah, 
	forgive me and have mercy on me.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and 
	blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘You are in a hurry, O worshipper. 
	When you have prayed, sit and praise Allah as He deserves to be praised, 
	then send blessings upon me, and then call upon Him (make du‘aa’).’ Then 
	another man prayed and then praised Allah and sent blessings upon the 
	Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and 
	blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘O worshipper, make du‘aa’, for you 
	will be answered.’” 

	(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, al-Da’waat, 3398; Abu Dawood, 
	1481; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, no. 
	2756). 

	It was narrated that Faddaalah ibn ‘Ubayd said: “The Prophet 
	(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) heard a man making du‘aa’ during 
	his prayer, but he did not send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and 
	blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah 
	be upon him) said: ‘This man is in a hurry.’ Then he called him and said to 
	him, or to someone else, ‘When any one of you prays, let him begin by 
	praising Allah, then let him send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and 
	blessings of Allah be upon him), then after that let him make du’aa’ as he 
	wishes.’” Abu ‘Eesa said: this is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. (al-Tirmidhi, 
	3399; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 2767) 

	It was narrated in a hadeeth that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood 
	said: “I was praying, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon 
	him) was nearby, and Abu Bakr and ‘Umar were with him. When I sat I started 
	by praising Allah, then I sent blessings upon the Prophet (peace and 
	blessings of Allah be upon him), then I prayed (made du‘aa’) for myself. The 
	Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘Ask, it will be 
	given to you; ask, it will be given to you.’” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, al-Jumu’ah, 
	541; al-Albaani said in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, it is hasan saheeh; no. 
	486). 

	If it is asked, how do we send blessings upon the Prophet 
	(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? 

	The answer is: 

	The way to send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and 
	blessings of Allah be upon him) is to say: “Allahumma salli ‘ala Muhammad 
	wa ‘ala aali Muhammad kamaa salayta ‘ala aali Ibraaheem. Wa baarik ‘ala 
	Muhammad wa ‘ala aali Muhammad kama baarakta ‘ala aali Ibraaheem 
	fi’l-‘aalameen innaka hameedun majeed (O Allah, send blessings upon 
	Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent blessings upon the 
	family of Ibraaheem, and bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, as You 
	blessed the family of Ibraheem among the nations. Verily You are Most 
	Praiseworthy, Full of Glory).”

	(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, Ahaadeeth al-Anbiya’, 3119) 

	This is how blessings are sent upon the Prophet (peace and 
	blessings of Allah be upon him). As for what is mentioned in the question 
	about prostrating for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon 
	him), this is haraam (forbidden) and is major shirk, because 
	prostration may only be done for Allah. So the Muslim must learn about the 
	matters of his religion from the Qur’aan and Sunnah and from trustworthy 
	scholars; he should ask about everything that he does not understand, so 
	that he will not fall into shirk, Allah forbid.

	He should also keep away from everyone who enjoins shirk, 
	bid’ah (innovation) and misguidance. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound.

	And Allah knows best. 

	May Allah send blessings upon our Prophet Muhammad.",Islam Q&A
13772,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13772,Does stealing prevent a person from inheriting?,"What is the ruling with regards to inheritence for a daughter who has run away from her(widowed) mother and taken her mothers money and other possesions.She was not raised Islamically and is disobedient to her mother.

The Mother does not wish to have anything to do with her daughter whatsoever.Would the daughter still be entitled to inheritence.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: The things that prevent a person 
    from inheriting are three: 
1 – Killing. The killer does not inherit 
    anything from his victim, because of the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The killer does not inherit.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2109; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in 
    Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 1713).  
Al-Tirmidhi said: Based on this, 
    according to the scholars, the killer does not inherit whether the killing was deliberate or accidental. Some of them said that if the killing was 
    accidental, then he can inherit. This is the view of Maalik.
2 – Difference of religion. A Muslim cannot 
    inherit from a kaafir, and kaafir cannot inherit from a Muslim, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The 
    Muslim does not inherit from a kaafir and the kaafir does not inherit from a Muslim.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6764; Muslim, 1614).
3 – Slavery. If the father is a slave and the 
    son is free, there are no rights of inheritance between them, because the slave does not possess anything and his wealth belongs to his master, 
    and if the slave inherits something, it will go to his master who has no connection with the deceased. 
See al-Tahqeeqaat al-Murdiyyah by 
    al-Fawzaan, p. 45. 
Based on this, a thief is not 
    prevented from inheriting, but he is to be asked to return whatever he stole. If he does not return it then the approximate value of what he stole 
    should be factored in to the calculation of the inheritance and the total amount that he stole should be deducted from his share of the 
    inheritance. If there is anything left of his share after that, it may be given to him, otherwise he should not be given anything, and he remains 
    guilty of the sin of stealing and disobeying his parents.
Secondly: 
This is an example of the consequences that 
    usually come to parents as a result of their negligence in raising their children in this world, before they are brought to account by Allaah on 
    the Day of Resurrection. Allaah has made the father and mother responsible for their children. It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar said: I 
    heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “Each of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. 
    The ruler is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. The man is the shepherd of his family and is responsible for his flock. The woman is the 
    shepherd of her husband’s household and is responsible for her flock. The servant is the shepherd of his master’s wealth and is responsible for 
    his flock. A man is the shepherd of his father’s wealth and is responsible for his flock. Each of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his 
    flock.” (Narrated from al-Bukhaari, 853; Muslim, 1829).  
And Allaah commands them (parents) to protect 
    themselves and their families from the Fire. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Ward off yourselves 
    and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from 
    executing) the Commands they receive from Allaah, but do that which they are commanded”
[al-Tahreem 66:6]
What we see nowadays of disobedience towards 
    parents is one of the results of parental failure to give children a proper Islamic upbringing. Children are brought up in a manner far removed 
    from the rulings of sharee’ah, so they do not know their parents’ rights, let alone the rights of Allaah. So how can fathers and mothers hope that 
    their children will be good when they have taken them far away from the straight path in the way they have raised them and cared for them? 
In the case of those who have not fallen 
    short in caring for their children and raising them in a proper Islamic manner, but then the children are not following Islamic guidance, this is 
    a test from Allaah for the fathers and mothers. For those who were negligent, it is a kind of punishment. 
Thirdly: 
Cutting off all ties with the daughter may 
    not always be the means of setting things straight. It is more akin to taking revenge and punishing and may lead to bad results that are the 
    opposite of what was hoped for. It is far better for the girl to stay with her family than for her to run away or be thrown out of the house, 
    because the evil that results from a girl leaving her family home is far greater than the evil that may result when she is with her family. 
Hence it is not prescribed in our religion to 
    forsake a person for the sake of forsaking them; it is prescribed only when doing so will lead to positive results. If it will lead to a greater 
    evil then it is not prescribed.

          do not have to stand up for someone who comes in, but it is good manners, 
          if someone stands up for you, to shake his hand, especially the head 
          of the household and prominent people. This is the matter of good manners. 
          The Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood up for Faatimah, and 
          she stood up for him, may Allaah be pleased with her. The Sahaabah (may 
          Allaah be pleased with them) stood up, on the Prophet’s command, for 
          Sa’d ibn Mu’aadh when he came to pass judgement on Bani Qurayzah. Talhah 
          ibn ‘Ubayd Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him) stood up in front 
          of the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when Ka’b ibn Maalik (may 
          Allaah be pleased with him) came after Allaah had accepted his repentance; 
          he shook his hand and congratulated him, then sat down. This is the 
          matter of good manners and this is broad issue. What is denouncable 
          is when people stand up and remain standing by way of veneration. But 
          if a person stands up to welcome his guest and honour him, or to shake 
          hands with him or greet him, this is something which is prescribed in 
          Islam. But to remain standing when people are sitting by way of veneration, 
          or standing at the door without greeting anyone or shaking hands with 
          anyone, this should not be done. Even worse than that is standing up 
          to venerate a person when he is sitting down, not for the sake of guarding 
          him but only for the purpose of veneration.
There 
          are three kinds of standing up, as the scholars said :
  
          

        (1)          
          When people stand up for someone to venerate 
          him when he is sitting down, as the Persians venerated their kings and 
          leaders, as described by the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). This is not permitted, 
          and for this reason the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told them to sit down when 
          he led them in prayer sitting down. He told them to sit down and to 
          pray behind him seated, and when they stood up he said, “You almost 
          venerated me like the Persians venerate their leaders.” 

        (2)
         
          When a person stands up when another person comes 
          in or goes out, without greeting him or shaking hands with him, rather 
          simply in order to venerate him. This at the very least is makrooh. 
          The Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) used not to stand up 
          for the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he came in to them, 
          because they knew that he 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) disliked that. 

(3)
         
When a person stands up for someone who has come 
in, in order to shake his hand or to take his hand and lead him to a 
          seat, etc. There is nothing wrong with that, rather it is the Sunnah 
          as mentioned above.","Kitaab Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 4, p. 394"

Is it islamically wrong for a woman to call her husband by his name or for a man to call his wife by her name when mentioning him/her?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Yes, it was proven that some of the Sahaabiyaat (female Sahaabah) mentioned their husband by their kunyahs (“father of So and so”). Examples of that include the following. 
It was narrated that ‘Awn Abu Juhayfah said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) established the bond of brotherhood between Salman and Abu’l-Dardaa’. Salmaan went to visit Abu’l-Dardaa’ and he saw Umm al-Dardaa’ looking unkempt. He said to her, “What is the matter with you?” She said, “Your brother Abu’l-Dardaa’ has no interest in this world.” Then Abu’l-Dardaa’ came (to visit Salmaan) and he made food for him, but he said, “I am fasting.” He said, “I will not eat until you eat.” So he ate. When night came, Abu’l-Dardaa’ went to stand in prayer. [Salmaan] said to him, “Go to sleep.” He slept a while, then he went to stand in prayer. [Salmaan] said to him, “Go to sleep.” When the end of the night came, Salmaan said to him, “Now get up.” They prayed, then Salmaan said “Your Lord has rights over you, your own self has rights over you and your family has rights over you. Give each one who has rights over you his rights.” [Abu’l-Dardaa’] came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)  and told him about that, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)  said, “Salmaan spoke the truth.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1832) 
It was narrated that Faatimah bint Qays said: My husband Abu ‘Amr ibn Hafs ibn al-Mugheerah ‘Ayyaash ibn Rabee’ah sent word to me, divorcing me, and he sent with it five wasa’ of dates and five wasa’ of barley. I said, “Do I have no maintenance apart from this, and should I not spend my ‘iddah in your house?” He said, “No.” I got dressed and went to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) . He said, “How many times has he divorced you (talaaq)?” I said, “Three.” He said, “He was right when he said that he does not have to spend on your maintenance.”
(Narrated by Muslim, 2721) 
 Secondly: 
With regard to a woman mentioning her husband by name, there is nothing wrong with that. For example: 
It was narrated that Zaynab, the wife of ‘Abd-Allaah (i.e., ibn Mas’ood) said: I was in the mosque and I saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He said, “Give in charity, even if it is from your jewellery.” Zaynab used to spend on ‘Abd-Allaah and on the orphans under her care. She said to ‘Abd-Allaah, “Ask the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) whether it is enough charity for me to spend on you and on the orphans under my care.” He said, “You go and ask the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).” So she went to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and found a woman from among the Ansaar at the door, with a similar question. [Zaynab said:] Bilaal passed by us and we said, “Ask the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) whether it is charity enough for me to spend on my husband and the orphans under my care. But do not tell him who we are.” He went in and asked him. (The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) asked, “Who is it?” He said, “Zaynab”. He asked, “Which Zaynab?” He said, “The wife of ‘Abd-Allaah.” (The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) said, “Yes, she will have two rewards, the reward of upholding the ties of kinship and the reward of charity.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1373; Muslim, 1667) 
It was narrated that Khuwaylah bint Maalik ibn Tha’labah said: “My husband Aws ibn al-Saamit divorced me by zihaar [saying “you are to me as my mother’s back”], so I came and complained to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) argued with me on his behalf and said, “Fear Allaah, for he is your cousin (son of your paternal uncle).” I did not leave before Allaah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘Indeed Allaah has heard the statement of her (Khawlah bint Tha‘labah) that disputes with you (O Muhammad) concerning her husband (Aus bin As‑Saamit),’
[al-Mujaadilah 58:1]
(Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1893; classed as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan and al-Haakim. See Khalaasat al-Badr al-Muneer, 2/229) 
Thirdly: 
With regard to saying one’s husband’s or wife’s name in front of other people, that depends on local custom (‘urf) of the people in any given society. In some societies, doing that is disliked, and in some societies it may even be seen as a lack of gheerah (protective jealousy). In the hadeeth of Ibn Mas’ood mentioned above, Bilaal (may Allaah be pleased with him) mentioned the wife of Ibn Mas’ood by name (Zaynab). If a woman is well known by her name and it is OK for people other than her husband to mention her by name, then how about her husband? 
It is preferable to mention people by their kunyah rather than their names in some societies, or in front of some people. Many problems arise from taking the matter of mentioning people’s names lightly.

13780,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13780,Marriage of a convert: must he marry someone of the same race?,"I would like to ask for your advice, I am a br. who prays believes in allah prays 5 times a day, fasts in ramadan  

and converted to islam over 5 years ago. I am looking to get married, however on meeting the sr. that I like, I am finding out that since her family is from another Race and because of this they will not accept me as her husband. 

She is a practising muslimah from an Indian/asian/pakistani/bengali type of background, and it is typical of people of these background never to let their children (especially girls) to marry outside their own cultures even if the one proposing is a practising muslim man. 

 Hence the mariage cannot take place on this basis alone. Since the majority of practising muslims in this country are from the indian subcontinent background,I have two questions 

1- how does a relative new-comer such as my self get married? 

2- Should reverts only marry reverts? Is there any basis for such cultural separation in islam? .",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    With regard to the first question, and the second, as soon as 
    you entered Islam you became one of the Muslims, with the same rights and 
    duties as they have. Based on that, then you may strive to guard your 
    chastity by marrying any good and righteous woman, based on the words of the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) [regarding looking 
    for a wife], “Look for the one who is religiously-committed, may your hands 
    be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper)!” 

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5090; Muslim, 1466) – whether she is 
    also new in Islam (i.e., a convert) or not. What matters is that she should 
    be righteous, as I mentioned. 

    Then if you propose marriage to a righteous woman, and she or 
    her family do not agree, then you must be patient and continue looking, 
    whilst also continuing to pray that Allaah will make it easy for you to find 
    a righteous woman who can help you to obey your Lord. 

    Secondly, with regard to the discrimination that you mention, 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, 
    and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, 
    the most honourable of you with Allaah is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa 
    [i.e. he is one of the Muttaqoon (the pious]”

    [al-Hujuraat 49:13]
The Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O you who believe, verily your 
    Lord is One, and your father [Adam] is one. There is no superiority of an 
    Arab over a non-Arab or of a non-Arab over an Arab, or of a red man over a 
    black man or of a black man over a red man, except in terms of taqwa 
    (piety). Have I conveyed (the message)?” They said: “The Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has conveyed (the 
    message).”

    (Narrated by Ahmad, 5/411; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in
    Ghaayat al-Maraam, 313; it was also narrated from Shaykh al-Islam Ibn 
    Taymiyah that its isnaad is saheeh, in al-Iqtidaa’, 69). 
According to another 
    hadeeth, the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Those who boast about their forefathers should desist or they will be less 
    significant before Allaah than the beetle that rolls up the dung with its 
    nose. Allaah has taken away from you the arrogance of Jaahiliyyah and its 
    pride in forefathers, so a person is either a pious believer or a doomed 
    evildoer. All the people are the children of Adam and Adam was created from 
    dust.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3890; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in 
    Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi, no. 3100; and in Ghaayat al-Maraam, 
    312, it was said that al-Tirmidhi and Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah classed 
    it as saheeh). 

    The dung beetle is a black bug that rolls up excrement. 
Hence it should become 
    clear to you that Islam does not discriminate between one Muslim and another 
    by any earthly standards, whether that be colour, lineage, wealth or 
    country. Rather the only criterion by which people are regarded as superior 
    to others before Allaah is taqwa (piety, consciousness of Allaah). Indeed, 
    the sharee’ah commands the guardian of a woman, if a person comes to propose 
    marriage who is religiously-committed and of good character and attitude, to 
    hasten to arrange the marriage, and to beware of rejecting him and not 
    accepting him, as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “If there comes to you one with whose religious commitment and 
    character you are pleased, then marry your daughter [or female relative 
    under your care] to him, for if you do not do that then there will be much 
    tribulation and mischief in the land.” They said, “O Messenger of Allaah, 
    what if there is some other objection?” He said, “If there comes to you one 
    with whose religious commitment and character you are pleased, then marry 
    your daughter [or female relative under your care] to him,” three times.

The rights of parents over their children may be summed up as treating them well in all matters, and behaving with them kindly as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We have enjoined on man to be dutiful and kind to his parents.” [al-Ahqaf 46:15] 
“And We have enjoined on man to be dutiful and kind to his parents.” [al-'Ankabut 29:8] 
“but behave with them in the world kindly.” [Luqman 31:15]
Shaykh al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “be dutiful and kind to parents” means: treat them kindly in all ways, in word and in deed. (Tafsir al-Sa’di, p. 524) 
How to be dutiful to parents in Islam
Obeying parents
One of the most important acts of worship that the child is asked to do with regard to his parents is to obey them, to do as they ask and to refrain from what they tell him not to do. So if his father tells him to do something, he hastens to do what he is told, and if he tells him not to do something, he hastens to give it up, so long as that does not involve any disobedience towards Allah and his Messenger, because there is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator. 
Making du’a for parents
Then he can make du’a for them and pray for forgiveness for them, especially when they grow old and weak and are in need of someone to treat them kindly and take care of their needs . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of honour. And lower unto them the wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say: ‘My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was young.’” [al-Isra 17:23-24]
Examples of kind treatment of parents in the Quran
 Allah has given examples in His Book of kind treatment of parents . Allah says of His slave Yahya ibn Zakariyya: 
“(It was said to his son): ‘O Yahya (John)! Hold fast the Scripture [the Tawrat (Torah)].’ And We gave him wisdom while yet a child. And (made him) sympathetic to men as a mercy (or a grant) from Us, and pure from sins [i.e. Yahya (John)] and he was righteous, And dutiful towards his parents, and he was neither arrogant nor disobedient (to Allah or to his parents). And Salam (peace) be on him the day he was born, and the day he dies, and the Day he will be raised up to life (again)!” [Maryam 19:12-15]
Ibn Jarir al-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Here Allah says: “And dutiful towards his parents” meaning that he was quick to obey them, loving towards them, and not disobedient. 
“and he was neither arrogant nor disobedient” – here Allah tells us that he was not too proud to obey Allah or his parents, rather he was humble and submissive towards Allah and his parents, doing what he was commanded to and avoiding what was forbidden to him; he neither disobeyed his Lord nor his parents.” (Tafsir al-Tabari, 16/58)
And Allah said of His slave ‘Isa ibn Maryam (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He [‘Isa (Jesus)] said: ‘Verily, I am a slave of Allah, He has given me the Scripture and made me a Prophet; And He has made me blessed wheresoever I be, and has enjoined on me Salah (prayer), and Zakah, as long as I live.” And dutiful to my mother, and made me not arrogant, unblest’” [Maryam 19:30-32]
Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The words “And dutiful to my mother” mean: and He has commanded me to be dutiful to my mother. This is mentioned after obedience to his Lord, because Allah often mentions the command to worship him and to be dutiful to one’s parents together, as in the verses where He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents.” [al-Isra 17:23] 
“give thanks to Me and to your parents. Unto Me is the final destination.” [Luqman 31:14] 
And the words “and made me not arrogant, unblest’” mean, ``He has not made me arrogant and too proud to worship and obey Him and to honour my mother, and thus be doomed as a result of that.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 3/121)
How to honor parents after their death
As for after the parents have died, the child can do many things, such as the following: 
1 – If he has wealth, and his parents were in debt, he can discharge their duty by paying off the debt for them . 
2 – If he has wealth and his parents had not performed Hajj, he may perform Hajj on their behalf, or pay for someone else to perform Hajj on their behalf. 
3 – He may pray for forgiveness for them and pray for mercy for them. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):   
“and say: ‘My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was young.’” [al-Isra 17:24]
Shaykh Ibn Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “This means, pray for mercy for them, when they are alive and after they die.” (Tafsir al-Sa’di, p. 524)
Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A man may be raised in status in Paradise and will say, Where did this come from? And it will be said: From your son’s praying for forgiveness for you.” Narrated by Ibn Majah, 3660; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, no. 1617. This applies if the child has reached the age of discernment and is able to earn money. But if the child is young and does not yet understand things, then these words do not apply in his case. 
How the righteous salaf honoured their parents
 An example of how the righteous salaf honoured their parents is that of ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him): 
It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Dinar from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar that a man from among the Bedouins met him on the road to Makkah. ‘Abd-Allah greeted him with salam, seated him on the donkey that he was riding and gave him a turban that he had been wearing on his head. Ibn Dinar said: We said to him: May Allah guide you, they are just Bedouins and they would be content with little. ‘Abd-Allah said: The father of this man was a friend of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab and I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “The best act of kindness is for the son to uphold ties (of friendship) with those who were his father’s friends.” Narrated by Muslim, 2552. 
According to another report narrated by Ibn ‘Umar: when he went out to Makkah, he had a donkey which he would ride when he got tired of riding his camel, and a turban which he tied around his head. One day whilst he was riding that donkey, a Bedouin passed by him. He said: Are you not So and So, the son of So and So? He said: Yes. He gave him the donkey that he was riding and said: Ride it. And he gave him the turban that he had been wearing on his head, and he said: Tie it around your head. Some of his companions said: May Allah forgive you, you have given this Bedouin a donkey that you used to ride when you got tired of riding your camel and a turban that you used to wear on your head. He said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “The best act of kindness is for a man to honour his father’s friend after he has died,” and (this man’s) father was a friend of ‘Umar. 
Abu Hurayrah was appointed in charge of Madinah by Marwan. He lived in Dhu’l-Hulayfah (approximately ten kilometers from Madinah) and his mother lived in one house and he lived in another. When he wanted to go out he would stand at her door, and say: Peace be upon you, O my mother, and the mercy of Allah and His blessings. And she would say: And upon you, O my son, and the mercy of Allah and His blessings. And he would say: May Allah have mercy on you, as you brought me up when I was young. And she would say: May Allah have mercy on you as you took care of me when I grew old. Then when he wanted to come in, he would do likewise.

    offer kafaarat yameen by feeding one poor person numerous times. 

    With regard to kafaarat yameen – and other kinds of kafaarah 
    (expiation) – it is essential to look for the number of poor persons 
    mentioned in the texts. 

    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in 
    al-Mughni: 
If a person who owes an 
    expiation can find the right number of poor persons, it is not sufficient 
    for him to feed less than ten in the case of kafaarat yameen, or less than 
    sixty in the case of expiation for zihaar (a jaahili form of divorce) or for 
    having intercourse (during the day) in Ramadaan. This is the view of 
    al-Shaafa’i, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “for its expiation (a deliberate oath) feed ten Masaakeen 
    (poor persons)”

    [al-Maa’idah 5:89]

    Whoever feeds one person, then he has not fed ten, therefore

What to Look for in a Spouse in Islam


Limits of relationship with a fiancé","Praise be to Allah.Etiquette of talking to non-Mahram women
It is permissible for a man to speak to a non-Mahram woman , subject to important guidelines and conditions, the purpose of which is to prevent Fitnah (temptation) and sin. These conditions include: 

It should be done without being alone with her.
It should not go beyond permissible topics.
There should be no Fitnah. If his desire is stirred by talking to her or if he starts to enjoy it, then it is prohibited.
The woman should not speak in a soft manner,
The woman should be wearing full Hijab and be modest, or he should speak to her from behind a door. It is better if they speak on the phone, and even better if they communicate via letters or email , for example.
That should not go beyond what is necessary. 

If these conditions are met and there is no fear of Fitnah, then it is allowed, and Allah knows best. 
Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan (may  Allah preserve him) said, in his answer on the ruling about young men speaking to young women on the telephone:
“It is not permissible for young men to speak to young women because of the Fitnah involved, unless the girl is engaged to the man who is talking to her , and they talk only about matters pertaining to their engagement; but it is preferable and safer for him to speak to her guardian about that.” (Al-Muntaqa min Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan, 3/163, 164)
Chatting before Marriage in Islam
You have not proposed to this girl yet, so you have to be very careful and avoid exposing yourself to the causes of Fitnah by taking all possible precautions to achieve your goal without approaching this girl. 
The basis for this is two verses from the Book of Allah: 
1 – “O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women. If you keep your duty (to Allah), then be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery) should be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner.” [Al-Ahzab 33:32 – interpretation of the meaning] 
2 – “And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts” [Al-Ahzab 33:53 – interpretation of the meaning] 
What to Look for in a Spouse in Islam
Finally I would like to remind you that the Muslim’s standards when choosing a wife should be the standards encouraged by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he said: “Choose the one who is religiously-committed , may your hands be rubbed with dust [i.e., may you prosper].” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5090 and Muslim, 1466)

    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz explained that the child who 
    is deaf and mute, when he reaches the age of puberty, is considered to be 
    accountable and expected to fulfil the obligations of prayer, etc. He added 
    that he may be taught what he needs to know by means of writing or signing, 
    because of the general meaning of the shar’i evidence which indicates that 
    these obligations apply to everyone who reaches the age of puberty and is of 
    sound mind. Puberty is reached at the age of fifteen, or when maniy 
    (discharge) is emitted as a result of feeling desire in a dream (“wet 
    dream”) or otherwise, and when coarse hair grows around the private parts. 
    In the case of women, there is a fourth sign of puberty, which is the onset 
    of menstrual periods.   
    The shaykh called upon the guardian of the one who is deaf or mute to pay 
    zakaah and fulfil other financial obligations on his behalf. He also has to 
    teach him what he does not know by all possible means so that he will 
    understand what Allaah requires of him and what Allaah has forbidden for 
    him.  
    The shaykh quoted as evidence the words of Allaah (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
    “So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can” 
    [al-Taghaabun 64:16] 
    And the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): 
    “If I command you to do a thing, then do as much of it as you can.”  
    And the shaykh explained that the accountable person who cannot hear or 
    speak, or who becomes unable to hear or speak, should fear Allaah and keep 
    his duty towards Him as much as he can by doing that which is enjoined upon 
    him and abstaining from that which is haraam. He should try to learn as much 
    of the religion as possible, by watching, writing and signing, so that he 
    may understand what is required.","Kitaab Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 9, p. 336"
