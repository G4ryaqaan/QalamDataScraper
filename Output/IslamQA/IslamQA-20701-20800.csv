My x-wife has remarried to a Muslim. We have four sons ages 1, 3, 5, & 7. I have requested majority custody of our sons, but she has refused and has made it very difficult for me to visit with our sons. What are my rights and obligations under these circumstances?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The mother has more right to custody of her children before the age of seven so long as she does not remarry, in which case the right passes to the one who is most entitled to that after her, because Ahmad (6707) and Abu Dawood (2276) narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr that a woman said: “O Messenger of Allah, my womb was a vessel for this son of mine and my breasts gave him (milk) to drink, and my lap was a refuge for him, but now his father has divorced me and he wants to take him away from me.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to her: “You have more right to him so long as you do not remarry.” This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
It is obligatory to allow the father to see his children and to ask how they are, whether they are in the custody of the mother or of someone else. 
Because the mother’s right to custody is lost when she remarries, then it should be given to the one who is most entitled to that after her. There was some difference of opinion among the fuqaha’ as to who has more right after the mother. Some scholars said that the right passes to the mother’s mother. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was of the view that the father has more right than the mother’s mother, on which basis custody should be given to you. Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/26, complete edition). 
Similarly if the mother’s mother is a kaafirah or an immoral person, then custody must be given to the father, even according to those who say that the mother’s mother has more right than the father. 
It should be noted that what is meant by custody is keeping and raising the child. Hence a person’s right to custody is lost if he is immoral and corrupt, or careless and heedless, or if he travels a great deal which will harm his children’s interests. 
The parents should cooperate in this matter, and pay attention to the child’s interests, so that their disputes will not adversely affect the children. 
There is no Qur’aanic verse concerning this matter which specifies who is more entitled to custody, but the following verses should be sufficient for the Muslim: 
“And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it). And fear Allah; verily, Allah is Severe in punishment” [al-Hashr 59:7] 
 
“But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission” [al-Nisa’ 4:65] 
“It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed into a plain error” [al-Ahzaab 33:36]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ruled that the mother loses the right to custody if she remarries, as stated in the hadeeth quoted above, so the believing woman has to accept that and submit.

    If a person takes out an interest based loan and buys 
    property with it, when he dies the property becomes part of the estate which 
    is inherited from him, but he has sinned by dealing in riba. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    What is haraam because of the way in which it is acquired is 
    haraam for the one who earns or acquires it, such as riba. But if the person 
    who dealt with riba dies, then his wealth is permissible for his heirs. What 
    is haraam in and of itself, such as alcohol, is haraam to the one who 
    acquires and to the one to whom he passes it on. Similarly, if a person 
    steals something or seizes it by force then dies, it is not permissible for 
    his heir (to take the stolen property); if he knows who it belongs to he 
    must return it, otherwise he should give it in charity on behalf of the 
    owner. 

    From Liqaa’aat al-Baab al-Maftooh, 1/304 
The Standing Committee

    the muhrim, man or woman, to wear gloves in ihraam, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The woman in 
    ihraam should not wear niqaab or gloves.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1838. 
Even though this hadeeth 
    speaks of women, the scholars are agreed that it is also haraam for a man to wear gloves when he is in ihraam. See al-Mughni, 5/120; 
    Fath al-Baari, 4/53. 
With regard to touching women during tawaaf and saa’i, touching a non-mahram woman is haraam, so men should be 
    careful and keep away from places where women are. If he touches a woman by accident, then there is no sin on him, because Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And there is no sin on 
    you concerning that in which you made a mistake, except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend”
[al-Ahzaab 33:5]
With regard to wudoo’ being invalidated by touching a woman, this has already been answered in question no. 
    2178. The most correct scholarly view is that touching a woman does not invalidate wudoo’. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on the tawaaf of a man who touches a non-mahram woman. He said:
If a person touches the body 
    of a women when doing tawaaf or when it is crowded in any place, that does not affect his tawaaf or his wudoo’, according to the more correct of 
    the two scholarly views. The scholars have disputed the question of whether touching a woman invalidates wudoo’, and there are several views. 
It was said that it does not 
    invalidate wudoo’ at all. And it was said that it invalidates wudoo’ in all cases, or that it invalidates wudoo’ if it is accompanied with 
    feelings of desire. 
The most correct of these 
    views is that it does not invalidate wudoo’ at all, and that if a man touches or kisses his wife, that does not invalidate his wudoo’ according to 
    the most correct opinion, because the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) kissed one of his wives then he prayed, and he 
    did not do wudoo’ again. And because the basic principle is that wudoo’ remains valid and one remains pure. Hence it is know that if a person’s 
    body touches a woman’s body in tawaaf, his tawaaf is still valid. The same applies to wudoo’; if he touches his wife or kisses her, his wudoo’ is 
    still valid so long as nothing comes out of him. But a man does not have the right to deliberately touch the body of a woman who is not his 
    mahram.

Alhamdulillah, however, my family has not always been supportive of me and at one point my mother wanted to take my daughter and put me in a mental hospital, due to my change. Alhamdulillah, now she is understanding. I was speaking to one sister and I was telling her about my mother and how she treated me; now I am thinking about what happened and it might make her look bad in the sight of that sister. She (my mother) is not Muslim, so does this mean I have committed gheebah (backbiting)! I feel very bad for that because I know she just did not understand due to the American media. May Allah forgive me!!!! Ameen.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We praise Allah for having guided you to Islam, and we ask Him to guide your family and to bring you together on the basis of good in this world and in the Hereafter. The bad treatment that a Muslim encounters from people after choosing the path of Islam is something natural. The prophets themselves were faced with this, and they had aspersions cast upon their honour and their mental faculties. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them but they said: ‘A sorcerer or a madman!’”
[51:52] 
Gheebah (backbiting) means to say about others things that they dislike. It is permissible in some situations, such as the advice of one who is able to advise you, and complaining about one who is mistreating you. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah does not like that the evil should be uttered in public except by him who has been wronged” [4:148] 
Mujahid said concerning the meaning of this verse: It refers to the one who has been wronged speaking about the wrong action of the one who wronged him. Al-Adaab al-Shar’iyyah by Ibn Muflih. 
It seems that when you spoke about how your mother has treated you, you did that only for the purpose of seeking advice from your friend, not to tell everybody how bad she is. There is nothing wrong with this, and it is one of the kinds of gheebah (speaking of a person in his or her absence) that are permitted, especially when you have been mistreated.  
The evidence for what has been stated above is as follows: 
‘Aishah narrated that Hind – the wife of Abu Sufyan – said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Abu Sufyan is a stingy man, and he does not give me what is enough for me and my child unless I take something from him when he does not realize it.” He said, “Take whatever is sufficient for you and your child on a reasonable basis.” [al-Bukhaari, Muslim. 
Abu Hurayrah said: A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) complaining about his neighbour. He said, “Go and bear it with patience.” He came back two or three times, then he [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] said: “Go and put your belongings out on the street.” So he put his belongings out on the street and the people started asking him about that, and he told them the reason. So the people started cursing [that neighbour] and praying against him. Then his neighbour came to him and said, “Go back, and you will never see me doing anything you dislike.”  [Abu Dawood]. 
So there is no sin on you for what you have said about your mother and do not worry about the influence of the American media on her or anyone else, because if you treat her well and give a good impression of Islam, that will bring better results.

Can you joining ‘Asr and Maghrib?


Do your best not to delay the prayer","Praise be to Allah.Delaying prayer due to work
We have already stated in the answer to question no. 21958  that it is not permissible to delay the prayer beyond its time because of work. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Men whom neither trade nor sale (business) diverts from the remembrance of Allah (with heart and tongue) nor from performing As-Salah (Iqamat-as-Salah) nor from giving the Zakah. They fear a Day when hearts and eyes will be overturned (out of the horror of the torment of the Day of Resurrection).
That Allah may reward them according to the best of their deeds, and add even more for them out of His Grace. And Allah provides without measure to whom He wills.” [Al-Nur 24:37-38]
So you must organize your time at work in a way that will not interfere with your performing the prayers on time and work out an agreement on a suitable solution with the administration, even if that causes you some difficulty, such as working extra hours, for example. Note that the benefits of increased faith in your heart that you will get as a result of praying on time will compensate for any difficulties you encounter, and that hardship will turn to joy – in sha Allah – because you will be putting up with it for the sake of Allah and seeking His pleasure. 
Something that the questioner deserves to be appreciated for is his regret at having missed prayers and having prayed them at the wrong time. This is how the believer should be, he should feel regret if he misses out on some righteous deed. But this regret should be a motive for him to correct his actions and avoid falling short in them. If he feels regret in his heart yet he still persists in missing prayers and doing bad deeds, then this is not right. 
Can you joining ‘Asr and Maghrib?
You say that you join ‘Asr and Maghrib prayers before the start of your shift or afterwards. 
You should note that the prayers which are allowed to be joined according to Shari`ah are Zuhr and ‘Asr , or Maghrib and ‘Isha. These are the combinations mentioned in Shari`ah. As for joining ‘Asr and Maghrib, this is not narrated in Shari`ah and is not valid. This was not suggested by any of the scholars. Based on that, if you have joined ‘Asr and Maghrib after sunset, you have to repent to Allah for delaying ‘Asr prayer until its time was over, and you have to resolve not to do such a thing again. 
If you joined ‘Asr and Maghrib before the time for Maghrib began, which is sunset, then you should note that prayers done before their time begins are not valid, so this Maghrib prayer of yours is not valid. Based on this you have to figure out the number of times that you prayed Maghrib before its time began – if you are uncertain then you should be on the safe side and assume it is the higher number – and repeat those prayers. Hasten to do that as much as you can. 
Do your best not to delay the prayer
You must try hard to solve this problem. It will not take you more than ten minutes to do this thing, so you can agree with the boss that you will make up this time before or after your shift. You may not be able to imagine that you can ask permission for ten minutes from work, but if you wanted to go to the bathroom they would never stop you from doing that, even though that may take the same amount of time or more. In your country there may be laws that protect the rights of minorities to practice their religion and which oblige bosses to respect the religion of those who work for them. You may have such laws which will enable you to ask for your rights. 
If it is too difficult for you, and you cannot solve this problem with the administration, then you have to look for another job which will not conflict with your establishing regular prayer. If you cannot find any other job and you will be adversely affected by your leaving this job, then there is the hope that this may be regarded as a necessity that will permit your joining your prayers and there will be no sin on you in that case, in sha Allah. 
You can join Zuhr and ‘Asr, at the time of either of them, and you can join Maghrib and ‘Isha at the time of either of them, depending on what is easier for you. 
We ask Allah to help us to understand Islam and to do and say good things, and to make things easy for you.

Allah has condemned the one who does that and has declared war on him, and spoken of his bad end on the Day of Resurrection. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Those who eat Ribaa will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaytaan (Satan) leading him to insanity. That is because they say: ‘Trading is only like Ribaa,’ whereas Allah has permitted trading and forbidden Ribaa. So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating Ribaa, shall not be punished for the past; his case is for Allah (to judge); but whoever returns (to Ribaa), such are the dwellers of the Fire — they will abide therein.
Allah will destroy Ribaa and will give increase for Sadaqaat (deeds of charity, alms). And Allah likes not the disbelievers, sinners” [al-Baqarah 2:275, 276]
“O you who believe! Fear Allah and give up what remains (due to you) from Ribaa (from now onward) if you are (really) believers.
And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger but if you repent, you shall have your capital sums. Deal not unjustly (by asking more than your capital sums), and you shall not be dealt with unjustly (by receiving less than your capital sums)” [al-Baraqah 2:278, 279]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba, the one who pays it, the one who writes it down and the two who witness it, and he said, “They are all the same.” Narrated by Muslim, 1598, from the hadeeth of Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him). 
And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A dirham of riba consumed knowingly by a man is worse before Allah than committing zina thirty-six times.” Narrated by Ahmad and al-Tabaraani, classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 3375. 
And there are other texts which point to the enormity and abhorrent nature of this crime.  
The Islamic financial system does not approve of any transaction that includes riba, rather the sharee’ah forbids certain transactions so as to prevent the means that lead to riba. 
Secondly: 
The banks that exist nowadays are all riba based banks, with a few rare exceptions. Just because a bank is located in a Muslim country does not mean that it is an Islamic bank. Most of these banks are connected to Jewish and Crusader banks overseas. It is most regrettable that in the Muslim lands which are home to more than a billion Muslims there is no Islamic bank that is free from riba, apart from a few institutions. 
So the decision makers among the Muslims have to pay due attention to this matter and establish an independent Islamic banking system. There are scholars and people who are able to work in this field, and there is a great deal of capital, praise be to Allah. 
Thirdly: 
The true Islamic financial system is a system that is free of riba, because it is a system that is derived from the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Your saying in your question that you have noticed riba in financial transactions in the Islamic banks needs further explanation. Perhaps you think that some of these transactions involve riba when they do not.

Recently many Muslims have been saying that it is haraam to have any business dealings with the Jews whatsoever. To the best of my limited knowledge, even when the Muslims were fighting the Jews in the time of the Prophet, sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam, he did not forbid trade with them, and when he died his shield or armor was with a Jews as collateral on a loan. Please inform us as to the correct position on this issue.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The basic principle is that it is permissible to interact and do business, buying and selling, with the Jews and others, because it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions interacted with the Jews of Madeenah, buying and selling, lending and putting items in pledge, and other kinds of interactions that are permissible according to our religion. The Jews with whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) interacted were people with whom the Muslims had a treaty; those who broke the treaty were either killed or expelled, or were left alone if that served some interest. 
But there is evidence which indicates that it is permissible to buy and sell with kuffaar who are in a state of war against the Muslims. 
Imam al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
Chapter: Buying and selling with the mushrikeen and people who are at war with Islam. 
Then he narrated (2216) that ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Abi Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We were with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) then a mushrik man came with some sheep that he was driving. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Are they for sale or a gift?” He said: “For sale.” So he bought a sheep from him. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Saheeh Muslim (11/14): 
The Muslims are unanimously agreed that it is permissible to interact with ahl al-dhimmah (non-Muslims living under Muslim rule) and other kuffaar, so long as the object of the transaction is not haraam, but it is not permissible for a Muslim to sell weapons or tools of war to those who are waging war against the Muslims, or anything that helps them to support their religion. 
Ibn Battaal said: dealing with the kuffaar is permissible, except for selling things to those who are at war with the Muslims that may help them against the Muslims. 
It was narrated in al-Majmoo’ (9/432) that there is scholarly consensus that it is forbidden to sell weapons to people who are waging war against Muslims. 
The reason for that is obvious, which is that these weapons will be used to fight the Muslims. 
Secondly:  
There is no doubt that it is prescribed to engage in jihad against the enemies of Allah, Jews and others, with our lives and our wealth. That includes every means that will weaken their economy and cause them harm. Money is the lifeblood of wars ancient and modern. 
The Muslims in general should cooperate in righteousness and piety and help the Muslims in all places in ways that will lead them to prevail and strengthen them and enable them to manifest the symbols of religion, to practise the teachings of Islam and to implement the rulings of sharee’ah and carry out hudood punishments, and whatever will lead to their victory over the kuffaar, Jews, Christians and others. They should strive their hardest in jihad against the enemies of Allah with all the means at their disposal. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Strive against the mushrikeen with your wealth, your lives and your tongues (speech).” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2504; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
The Muslims have to help the mujaahideen as much as they can, and do everything that will strengthen Islam and the Muslims. They must also strive against the kuffaar in whatever ways they can, and do everything they can to weaken the kuffaar and the enemies of Islam. They should not employ them as workers such as typists, accountants, engineers or servants in any kind of service that gives them more power to collect the wealth of the Muslims and use it against them. 
Conclusion: 
The one who boycotts the products of the kuffaar who are waging war against Islam, intending thereby to make manifest the fact that he does not like or support them, and to weaken their economy, will be rewarded in sha Allah for this good intention. 
Whoever deals with them on the basis of the principle that it is permissible to deal with the kuffaar – especially buying things that he needs – there is no sin on him, in sha Allah, and that does not affect the principle of al-wala’ wa’l-bara’ (loyalty and friendship vs. disavowal and enmity) in Islam. 
The Standing Committee was asked: What is the ruling on Muslims not cooperating with and not wanting to buy from Muslims, and preferring to buy from the kuffaar; is this permissible or forbidden? 
They replied: 
The basic principle is that it is permissible for the Muslim to buy whatever he needs of things that Allah has permitted from both Muslims and kaafirs. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) bought from the Jews, but if a Muslim turns away from dealing with his fellow Muslim for no good reason – such as deceit or high prices or bad products – and he prefer to buys from kaafirs with no reason, that is haraam, because it implies that one is befriending the kuffaar, approving of them and liking them, and because it involves reducing the Muslims’ business and preventing them from selling their goods, if the Muslim takes that as his habit. But if there is a reason for that, such as those mentioned above, then he should advise his Muslim brother to give up these faults. If he accepts the advice, then praise be to Allah, otherwise he should go to someone else, even if he is a kaafir, if he is honest and decent in his dealings.

Purpose of marriage in Islam


Mut’ah marriage according the Rafidis","Praise be to Allah.What is mut’ah marriage?
Mut’ah or temporary marriage refers to when a man marries a woman for a specific length of time in return for a particular amount of money. 
History of mut’ah marriage
The basic principle concerning marriage is that it should be ongoing and permanent. Temporary marriage – i.e., mut’ah marriage – was permitted at the beginning of Islam, then it was abrogated and became haram until the Day of Judgement. 
Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade mut’ah marriage and the meat of domestic donkeys at the time of Khaybar. According to another report, he forbade mut’ah marriage at the time of Khaybar and he forbade the meat of tame donkeys. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3979; Muslim, 1407) 
Al-Rabi’ ibn Sabrah al-Juhani narrated that his father told him that he was with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said, “O people, I used to allow you to engage in mut’ah marriages, but now Allah has forbidden that until the Day of Resurrection, so whoever has any wives in a mut’ah marriage, he should let her go and do not take anything of the (money) you have given them.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1406)
Purpose of marriage in Islam
Allah has made marriage one of His signs which call us to think and ponder. He has created love and compassion between the spouses, and has made the wife a source of tranquility for the husband. He encouraged us to have children and decreed that a woman should wait out the ‘iddah period and may inherit. None of that exists in this haram form of marriage. 
A woman who is married in a mut’ah marriage, according to the Rafidis – i.e. the Shi’ah, who are the ones who say that this is permissible – is neither a wife nor a concubine. But Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts)
Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their right hands possess, for then, they are free from blame;
But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.” [al-Muminun 23:5-7]
Mut’ah marriage according the Rafidis
The Rafidis quote invalid evidence to support their argument that mut’ah is permissible. For example: 

They quote the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“…so with those of whom you have enjoyed sexual relations, give them their Mahr as prescribed…” [al-Nisa 4:24]
They say: this verse indicates that mut’ah is permissible, and the word ‘their mahr (ujurahunna – lit. their dues or their wages)’ is evidence that what is meant by the phrase ‘you have enjoyed sexual relations’ is mut’ah. 
The refutation of this is the fact that prior to this Allah mentions the women whom a man is forbidden to marry, then he mentions what is permissible for him, and He commands the man to give to the woman he marries her mahr. 
The joy of marriage is expressed here by the word enjoyment (‘of whom you have enjoyed sexual relations’). A similar instance occurs in the Sunnah, in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah according to which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A woman is like a bent rib, if you try to straighten her you will break her. If you want to enjoy her, then enjoy her while she still has some crookedness in her.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4889; Muslim, 1468) 
The mahr is referred to here as ajr (lit. dues or wages), but this does not refer to the money which is paid to the woman with whom he engages in mut’ah in the contract of mut’ah. The mahr is referred to as ajr elsewhere in the Book of Allah, where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O Prophet (Muhammad)! Verily, We have made lawful to you your wives, to whom you have paid their Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage)…” [al-Ahzab 33:50]
Thus it becomes clear that there is no evidence in this verse to suggest that mut’ah is permissible. 
Even if we were to say for argument’s sake that this verse indicates that mut’ah is permitted, we would still say that it is abrogated by the reports in the sahih Sunnah which prove that mut’ah is forbidden until the Day of Resurrection. 

The reports that some of the Companions regarded it as being permissible, especially Ibn 'Abbas.

The refutation here is the fact that the Rafidis are following their own whims and desires, because they regard the Companions of the Prophet (may Allah be pleased with them) as disbelievers, then you see them quoting their actions as permissible in this instance and in others. 
With regard to those who said that it is permissible, they are among those who did not hear that it had been forbidden. The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) – including ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib and ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Zubayr – refuted Ibn ‘Abbas’s view that mut’ah was permitted. 
‘Ali narrated that he heard Ibn ‘Abbas permitting mut’ah marriage, and he said, “Wait a minute, O Ibn 'Abbas, for the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade it on the day of Khaybar and (he also forbade) the meat of tame donkeys.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1407)

Should one commit a good deed for the sake of Allah and the Holy Prophet , should one commit his good deed for the sake of Allah and out of love of the Holy Prophet or his Sunnah, or should one commit a good deed for the sake of Allah alone?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.When doing acts of worship, they should be done sincerely and purely for the sake of Allah alone, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him), and perform As‑Salah (Iqaamat‑as‑Salah) and give Zakah, and that is the right religion” [al-Bayyinah 98:5] 
“And who has (in mind) no favour from anyone to be paid back,
Except to seek the Countenance of his Lord, the Most High” [al-Layl 92:19-20]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah does not accept any deed except that which is done only for Him and to seek His Countenance.”
Narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 3140; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 52. 
Think about what Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Would that they were contented with what Allah and His Messenger gave them and had said: “Allah is Sufficient for us. Allah will give us of His Bounty, and so will His Messenger (from alms). We implore Allah (to enrich us)” [al-Tawbah 9:59]
Note how this verse ascribes the giving to Allah and His Messenger, and sufficiency to Allah alone. The verse does not say “Allah and His Messenger are sufficient for us”. And it describes the imploring as being to Allah alone, as He said, “We implore Allah”, and does not say “we implore Allah and His Messenger.” This is like the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So when you have finished (your occupation), devote yourself for Allah’s worship.
And to your Lord (Alone) turn (all your) intentions and hopes” [al-Inshiraah 94:7-8]
See Zaad al-Ma’aad, 1/36 
So worship should be devoted to Allah alone; it is not permissible to do any act of worship with the intention of drawing closer to any created being. 
With regard to loving the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), that means following him and venerating him, not by worshipping him. 
Worship can only be acceptable to Allah if it meets two conditions: 
1 – It is done sincerely for Allah alone
2 – It follows the Sunnah of Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and is in accordance with his sharee’ah. 
These two conditions are indicated by the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord” [al-Kahf 18:110]
Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “ ‘Let him work righteousness’ means, that which is in accordance with the laws of Allah. ‘And associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord’ means, worship in which he seeks the Countenance of Allah alone, with no partner or associate.’ These are the basis of acceptable deeds: it must be sincerely for the sake of Allah alone, and correct according to the sharee’ah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” 
So when you worship you must seek the Countenance of Allah alone, and strive to follow the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). We ask Allah to help us to do righteous deeds.

I am a stage my parents want me to get married. But I am finding it difficult to say yes to anyone of the proposals because they have all had some kind of relationship or been clubbing etc in the past.....
Most people say they have changed and so forth, but i tend to think, these actions have ramifications in the future.....",,,"Praise be to Allah.Islam is all moderation. Adherence to the teachings of Islam, doing the obligatory duties and avoiding the things that are forbidden are not optional for the Muslim, because these are things that Allaah has enjoined upon him. There is so much confusion nowadays that a person who avoids some haraam things and does some obligatory duties is regarded as being over-strict and stubborn. Undoubtedly this is because the people have deviated from correct understanding of Islam and because they indukge so much in sin and neglect the obligatory duties prescribed in sharee’ah. 
We appreciate your keenness to adhere to the teachings of Islam in a society such as the one in which you are living. You should note that what you are doing is an action that is beloved by Allaah and by His believing friends, and that it is something which is hated by the devils among mankind and the jinn. 
Your keenness to find a righteous husband is in accordance with teachings of Islam on choosing and marrying a spouse, but you should not reject a person who is known for his good character and religious commitment because of his past. If a person has repented, his past should not be a source of shame and he should not be rejected if he comes seeking marriage. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The one who repents from sin is like one who did not sin at all.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi and classed as hasan by al-Albaani. But if he has a past record of sin and it is not known whether he had given it up, in such a case you cannot be sure of his morals or religious commitment, so he cannot be accepted as a marriage partner. 
It is not enough for a person to tell his fiancée or her guardians that he has changed and has given up the bad and immoral things that he used to do; his word cannot be accepted and believed until there is the certainty that he is telling the truth or that he has definitely given up those bad things. 
Strive to choose a righteous man even if he has a past and do not reject him. Reject everyone who is known to have a bad past and has not given it up, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told men: “A woman may be married for four things: her wealth, her lineage, her beauty, or her religious commitment. Choose the one who is religiously-committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5090; Muslim, 1466). 
This applies also to women, i.e., a woman should not accept anyone but a man who is religiously committed and of good character. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If there comes to you to marry (your daughter) one who with whose religious commitment and character you are pleased, then marry (your daughter) to him, for if you do not do that, there will be fitnah (tribulation) in the land and widespread corruption.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1084; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 866. 
It says in Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi: The phrase “if there comes to you to marry (your daughter)” means if he comes to ask to marry a woman from among your children or relatives. “One with (whom) … you are pleased” means you think well of him, and are pleased with his religious commitment. “His character” means his attitude and how he deals and interacts with others. “Then marry (your daughter) to him, for if you do not do that” means, if you do not marry (your daughter) to one with whose religious commitment and character you are pleased, and you are only concerned with lineage, beauty and wealth, “there will be fitnah (tribulation) in the land and widespread corruption” i.e., great corruption, because if you will only marry her to someone who is wealthy or of high status, most of your womenfolk may remain without husbands, and most of your men will remain without wives, so there will be a lot of temptation to commit zina, and perhaps the guardians may feel that their honour has been violated (because of zina), so there will be a lot of tribulation and corruption, which will result in illegitimacy and a lack of righteousness and chastity. 
Some of the Sahaabah were mushriks, then they entered Islam and became good Muslims, and they got married, and were not rejected because of what they had done in the past. 
What matters is what a man is adhering to now, so long as he has repented from whatever he has done in the past. 
We ask Allaah to make it easy for you to find a righteous husband and have righteous children.

Is it necessary for me to cover in his presence?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The husband’s father is considered to be a woman’s mahram even if her husband divorces her, because Allah says, stating who a one’s mahrams are (interpretation of the meaning): 
“the wives of your sons who (spring) from your own loins” [al-Nisa’ 4:23]
In this case, the father-in-law becomes a mahram simply as soon as the marriage contract is completed; if a man makes a marriage contract with a woman, then the man’s father becomes a mahram for his son’s wife, even if the marriage is not consummated. 
This is what the scholars called al-mahaarim bi’l-musaaharah (mahrams by marriage). 
The women who become mahrams through marriage are of four types:
 1 – Women married by one’s father (i.e., father’s wife and also grandfathers’ wives). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And marry not women whom your fathers married” [al-Nisa’ 4:22]
2 – One’s wife’s mother or grandmother: 
“Forbidden to you (for marriage) are… your wives’ mothers…”
[al-Nisa’ 4:23 – interpretation of the meaning]
3 – One’s stepdaughter (a wife’s daughter by a previous husband). The stepdaughter is not a mahram unless the man has consummated the marriage with her mother. If he simply made a marriage contract with her but did not consummate the marriage, then she is not a mahram, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“your stepdaughters under your guardianship, born of your wives to whom you have gone in — but there is no sin on you if you have not gone in them”
[al-Nisa’ 4:23 – interpretation of the meaning]
4 – One’s son’s wife and one’s grandsons’ wives, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“the wives of your sons who (spring) from your own loins”
 [al-Nisa’ 4:23 – interpretation of the meaning]
From Jaami’ Ahkaam al-Nisa’ by al-‘Adawi, 5/302 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“… your wives’ mothers, your stepdaughters under your guardianship, born of your wives to whom you have gone in — but there is no sin on you if you have not gone in them (to marry their daughters), — the wives of your sons who (spring) from your own loins …” [al-Nisa’ 4:23]
These three are mahrams by marriage. The phrase “your wives’ mothers” means that it is haram for a man to marry the mother or grandmother of his wife, no matter how far the line of ascent reaches (i.e., great-grandmother, etc), whether that is through the mother’s line or the father’s. She becomes his mahram as soon as the marriage contract is done. 
If a man makes a marriage contract with a woman, it becomes haram for him to marry her mother and she becomes one of his mahrams even if the marriage with her daughter is not consummated. If it so happens that the daughter dies or he divorces her, then he is still a mahram for her mother. If it so happens that consummation of the marriage is delayed, then he is still a mahram to her mother; she may uncover her face in front of him and he may travel with her and be alone with her, and there is no sin on him, because the mother and grandmother of the woman become mahrams as soon as the marriage contract is done, because Allah says “your wives’ mothers”, and a woman becomes a man’s wife as soon as the marriage contract is done. 
The phrase “the wives of your sons who (spring) from your own loins” means that it becomes haram for a man to marry the wife of his son or grandson, no matter how far the line of descent extends, as soon as the marriage contract is done. The wife of one’s son’s son (grandson) becomes a mahram to the grandfather as soon as the marriage contract is done. Hence if a man makes a valid marriage contract with a woman, then he divorces her immediately thereafter, she becomes a mahram for his father and grandfather, no matter how far the line of ascent reaches, because of the general meaning of the phrase, “the wives of your sons who (spring) from your own loins”. The woman becomes permissible for her husband as soon as the marriage contract is done.

But regretfully, so many Muslims do not acknowledge nor apply these standards and I have seen many women taken advantage of due to it. So my question is rgarding ""Womens Rights""...
my husband & I spoke in detail before deciding to marry, and I made myself clear that I was not interested in a husband who smoked, for a variety of reasons. He was a smoker and stated he had wanted a reason to quit for a long time, and would quit. After about a month of not smoking, I agreed to marry him, the night of our marriage following the ceremony I found out that he was still smoking and had not completely quit. He asked that I be patient because he was still trying... Its 5 years and two kids later. Does a woman have any rights, or means by which she can be recompensed for unfulfilled agreements?
Given the choice I would not be in this situtation which I was deceived to be in.",,,"Praise be to Allah.What the sister did by stipulating the condition that her husband give up smoking is something good, for which she is to be commended. 
Smoking is an evil action and is haraam according to sharee’ah. It goes against the sound nature of man (fitrah) and harms a person’s health and the health of those around him. He is like the one who works the bellows: either he will burn your clothes or you will notice a foul smell coming from him. 
But it is very strange that the sister has put up with her husband for so long after finding out that he had not stopped smoking. She has stayed with him for five years, during which she had produced two children. This is a long time, and it indicates that she accepts or does not care what he does. It is well known that no one would put up with such a thing for so long. 
The conditions which a wife stipulates for her husband prior to marriage give her the choice, if her husband goes against them. If she wants, she may annul the marriage, and if she wants she may forego those conditions and stay in the marriage. 
If a woman foregoes her conditions or she knows that her husband has gone against the conditions of marriage but accepts that, which indicates that she has foregone these conditions, then she has no right to annul the marriage after that. 
This is what seems to be the case here: if the sister had put up with it for a reasonable amount of time, or she had refused to stay in the marriage as soon as she found out that her husband was still smoking, then she could have annulled the marriage and taken her rights in full, until her husband really gave up smoking. 
But she stayed for so long and had two children in the meantime, so I do not think it is permissible for her to ask for annulment of the marriage, let alone ask for compensation for her husband not fulfilling the conditions of the marriage contract. 
The husband has to fear Allaah and he should realize that what he is doing is a major sin, to which may be added a further sin, namely not fulfilling the conditions stipulated in the marriage contract. The conditions of marriage are the most binding of conditions and are the most important before Allaah, because through them intimacy becomes permissible. 
It was narrated that ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir said: The Messenger of Allaah (S) said: “The conditions which most deserve to be fulfilled are those by means of which intimacy becomes permissible to you.”

The scholars agree on the effects of breastfeeding in establishing the prohibition on marriage.,"Breastfeeding is the right of the child


Effects of breastfeeding in establishing the prohibition on marriage


Medical benefits of breastfeeding","Praise be to Allah.Breastfeeding is the right of the child
If the infant needs to be breastfed, then breast milk must be provided for him. 
It says in al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (22/239): 
“There is no difference of opinion among the jurists that it is obligatory to breastfeed an infant so long as he needs that and he is at the age for breastfeeding. 
Breastfeeding is a proven right of the infant, according to the rulings of the Shari’ah, and must be provided for him by the one whose duty it is to do so. The jurists clearly stated that breastfeeding is the right of the child. 
They explained the reason for that as being that breastfeeding for an infant is like maintenance for an adult. 
What they said is true and is indicated by the Quran. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother’s food and clothing on a reasonable basis.” [Al-Baqarah 2:233]
Allah has enjoined upon the father to spend on the woman who nurses his child, because nutrition reaches the child via the nurse through breast milk. So spending on the nurse is in fact spending on him.

It says in Sharh Muntaha al-Iradat: 
“The one who is obliged to spend on the infant, whether male or female, is obliged to spend on the child’s nurse, because the child is nourished by the milk produced by the nurse, and that can only happen if she is nourished. So it is obligatory to spend on the nurse because this is in fact spending on the child.” (Al-Mufassal fi Ahkam al-Marah, 9/464) 
Effects of breastfeeding in establishing the prohibition on marriage
The scholars unanimously agree on the effects of breastfeeding in establishing the prohibition on marriage and on making the child the mahram of the woman who breastfeeds him, and making it permissible to look at her and be alone with her, but it does not make it obligatory to spend on the person, or make him an heir or a guardian in cases of marriage. 
The reason for this mahram relationship is obvious, because when the infant is nourished by the milk of this woman, his flesh grows on that, so it is as if he is her own child. 
Hence the scholars regarded it as makruh to appoint a disbelieving woman or an immoral woman as a wet-nurse, or a woman who was suffering from a contagious disease, because it may pass to the child. 
They regarded it as mustahabb to choose a wet-nurse who was of good character and morals, because breastfeeding changes the child’s nature. 
It is better if no one breastfeeds the child but his mother, because that is more beneficial, and that may be obligatory for her if the child will not accept the breast of anyone else. 
Doctors encourage giving the mother’s milk, especially in the early months. 
The wisdom of Allah in creating the nourishment of the child in his mother’s milk has been proven through scientific and medical research. 
Medical benefits of breastfeeding 
Breastfeeding brings great benefits. Allah has enjoined breastfeeding in His Book, when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The mothers shall give suck to their children for two whole years, (that is) for those (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling.” [Al-Baqarah 2:233]
So Allah has stated the child’s right to be breastfed. 
Fourteen hundred years after this verse was revealed, international organizations such as the World Health Organization have issued statement after statement calling on mothers to breastfeed their children, whereas Islam enjoined that fourteen centuries ago. 
The benefits of breastfeeding for the child include the following: 

The mother’s milk is sterile, containing no germs. 
The mother’s milk cannot be imitated by any milk prepared from the milk of cows, goats or camels. It is composed in such a way as to meet the child’s needs day after day, from birth until weaning. 
The mother’s milk contains sufficient amounts of protein and sugar that suit the infant completely, whereas the proteins in cow’s, goat’s and buffalo’s milk are difficult for the child’s stomach to digest, because they are suited to the offspring of those animals. 
The development of children who are breastfed is faster and more complete than that of children who are bottle-fed. 
The psychological and emotional bond between the mother and her child. 
The mother’s milk contains various elements that are essential to the child’s nourishment, in the right amounts and formats needed by his body, and in a form that is suited to his ability to digest and absorb.  The nourishing content of the milk is not fixed; it changes day by day according to the child’s needs. 
The mother’s milk is kept at a suitable temperature that meets the child’s needs, and can be given to him at any time. 
Breastfeeding is a natural means of contraception for the mother, and is free of the complications that may accompany use of birth control pills, the coil (IUD) or injections. (From Tawdih al-Ahkam, 5/107)

i cant leave the salafs because they are the only sound jammah in my little (unnoticed town) where no other organisations are present. apart from the grave? peer worshippers.  
and if i do follow them would that constitute me blind following the salafs cos as the hanafi say we must follow only one imam?  
to sum up all what is the best solution? why do majority of these groups,sects whatever always quote hadith and then say it has saheeh sanad, but they contradict other hadith? so how can they be authentic? so what is to be done??????.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We have discussed in many of our answers the standard by which the Muslim can judge the groups, sects and parties that go against Islam. We will explain it in more detail here: 
With regard to differences which you see between the Muslim nowadays, Allah has not left the people confused and unable to distinguish the true from the false, rather Allah has created signs by which the truth and those who are sincere may be known, and He has created clear evidence and proof for the correct path, from which no one deviates but he is doomed. 
When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) spoke of the ummah splitting into seventy-three groups, he said that they would all be in Hell apart from one, the one which follows the same path as him and his companions. This is the standard, so we have no choice but follow in the footsteps of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them). It is not sufficient for a person to quote a hadeeth and say that it is saheeh, then use that as evidence to support his madhhab or his point of view according to his own understanding of that hadeeth; rather what he should do is to research whether the Sahaabah understood this hadeeth in this manner or not. 
This is the criterion which divides those who really follow the truth from others. This means referring the interpretation of Islam to our righteous forebears, the Sahaabah and those who followed them in truth, for they are the best and most knowledgeable of this ummah, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said. 
Anyone who examines the groups that have deviated from the Straight Path will see that they have confused the people by quoting a verse or a hadeeth out of context, so that people think that they are following the Qur’aan and Sunnah, but they cannot prove that this is the way in which the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) understood these texts. 
Those who distort the attributes of Allah, those who worship graves and circumambulate them, those who dance in dhikr, those who deny the divine will and decree (al-qadar), those who say that the Qur’aan was created, and other deviant beliefs and ways, none of them claim that his belief is the same as the belief of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Even if they claim that they have a verse or hadeeth to support them, they cannot prove that their interpretation is the same as that of those who witnessed the revelations and heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), namely the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them). 
This is an important and precise standard by means of which a person can know whether what he hears and reads of beliefs and ways whose proponents say is true guidance is in fact true or false.  
If you follow what the Salafi scholars tell you of Tawheed, fiqh and hadeeth, this is following true Islam, which Allah wants for all people. The Shaytaan may come and tell you and whisper to you that this is taqleed (blind imitation) and is not permissible; undoubtedly that is the first step towards deviation from the right path. Allah has enjoined upon the ordinary Muslim to ask the scholars and to follow their opinions and fatwas. You know that the closest of them to the right path and the truth are those who follow the path of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in their understanding of the Qur’aan and Sunnah; they are the followers of the righteous Salaf. 
The Muslim who has some measure of Islamic knowledge can find out for himself whether what he hears or reads is sound or not, by studying and comparing it with that which has been proven from the righteous salaf. 
There is no reason why the one who goes against the way of the Salaf should not be right in some cases, but no way or madhhab can be sound apart from the way of the salaf or first generations of this ummah, the Sahaabah and Taabi’een and those who follow them in truth. 
Everything quoted by the Salafi scholars is the view of the Sahaabah and of Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib, al-Zuhri, Mujaahid, ‘Ata’, Maalik, Hammaad ibn Zayd, Hammaad ibn Salamah, al-Shaafa’i, Ahmad, al-Bukhaari, Muslim, Abu Dawood, and other prominent scholars. 
You will find that the innovators quote that which they think supports their view, and ignore that which clearly proves that they are wrong. You will find them mentioning things in their books that goes against the Sunnah, and rejecting the Sunnah because it goes against their books, distorting that which is stated clearly in the Qur’aan, describing as da’eef that which is clearly stated in the Sunnah because it goes against their opinions and their whims and desires, and so on. For this reason they are called ahl al-ahwa’ (people of whims and desires). 
With regard to Ahl al-Sunnah, they are more objective, they look at the Sunnah without any bias or preconceptions, and they give the Sunnah – if it is saheeh – precedence over everything else. They do not have any whims and desires that they follow to the extent that they reject a hadeeth or distort a verse for their sake. 
In fact there is no contradiction between the texts of the revelation, rather there may appear to be a contradiction in some cases. Every field of knowledge has specialized scholars, so in the field of hadeeth there are scholars who can explain what is saheeh (sound) and what is not, and can explain what is meant and dispel confusion, and reconcile between reports which seem to contradict one another. 
To sum up: 
The best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the people with the most knowledge of this guidance are the scholars of hadeeth, namely the righteous salaf. Those who follow them will be saved and those who go against them will be doomed. 
So you must adhere to this path and ask Allah for guidance and steadfastness. 
With regard to the questioner saying that Ahl al-Hadeeth are the “Saudi salafis”, this restriction is not correct. 
Ahl al-hadeeth are not restricted to a particular country or to certain people, rather Ahl al-hadeeth includes everyone who follows the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and understands it correctly in accordance with the understanding of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) and those who follow them in truth.

Some people say that what the sick sees during ruqueyah can be right but it can be also wrong.Those people say that if someone accuse someone else then he has to do tawba because he accuse someone who maybe didn't do anything.Are those people right? Please answer my question because a lot of people have problems because of this.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    What people have told you, that the one who has been affected 
    by witchcraft should see the one who put the evil eye on him or put a spell 
    on him, may or may not be true. It is not correct to accuse an innocent 
    person of using witchcraft against the victim. What the victim sees during 
    the ruqyah cannot be taken as being correct for sure, rather what usually 
    happens is something imaginary from the Shaytaan that is aimed at stirring 
    up enmity and hatred among people. So we should not pay any attention to it. 
    But even though, according to sharee’ah, such things cannot be relied on, 
    that does not mean that we should not take precautions against those whom it 
    is feared may cause harm through witchcraft or the evil eye etc, without 
    that implying any accusation without proof or causing any feeling of 
    enmity. 

    This accusation is very serious because it may be tantamount 
    to an accusation of kufr, and not just an accusation of causing harm. That 
    is because the practitioner of witchcraft is either a kaafir or an evildoer. 
    The ruling varies according to the way in which he practices witchcraft. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in his commentary on the hadeeth, 
    “Avoid the seven things which doom a person to Hell: associating others with 
    Allaah, witchcraft…”: 

    The word sihr (witchcraft) is one of the actions that doom a 
    person to Hell. The apparent meaning of the words of the Prophet SAWS (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is that it makes no difference if that 
    is done through the devils or by means of medicines and potions. 

    Because if it is done through the devils, that can only be 
    done by associating them in worship with Allaah, which comes under the 
    heading of shirk (associating others with Allaah). If it is other than that, 
    it is also a major sin, because witchcraft is one of the worst crimes that 
    can be committed against the sons of Adam. It adversely affects the 
    spiritual and worldly affairs of the victim, and causes him anxiety, thus 
    making him like an animal. Indeed it is even worse than that, because 
    animals were created like that, but if a human being is diverted from his 
    true, sound nature, this causes hardship and anxiety to an extent which only 
    Allaah knows. Hence witchcraft comes second only to shirk in this list of 
    grave sins.

20782,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20782,Does the grandson inherit from his grandfather?,"I’ve heard that if a man dies, leaving behind children and his father is still alive, the children of that man do not inherit the property of their grandfather (the man’s father). I want to know if this is true according to Sharee’ah. I wanted to know this because I feel that Allah would not have ordered such an unfair division especially when those fatherless children are more in need of care. If such a rule is there, then there must be some conditions. Could you kindly throw some light on this according to Islamic Laws of Inheritance with proofs from Ahaadeeth and the Qur’an?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.What you mentioned about the sons of the 
    deceased son not inheriting from their grandfather is correct, but that is subject to the condition that the deceased grandfather does not have 
    one or more living sons. In that case the grandsons are prevented from inheriting by the presence of the son, namely their paternal uncle. 
But if the grandfather does not have any 
    living sons, then his grandchildren inherit from him. 
What some of the common people think, that 
    the grandsons should take their father’s share, is contrary to the scholarly consensus that one of the conditions of inheritance is that there 
    should be certainty that the heir was alive after the death of the deceased, because in this case the son died before his father, so it is 
    impossible for him to have a share of his father’s estate who died after him. 
It says in Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj fi Sharh 
    al-Minhaaj (6/402): “ ‘If the two types are both present,’ meaning his own children and his son’s children, ‘whether his own child is male’ 
    only, or there is also a female, ‘the son’s children are prevented from inheriting’ according to scholarly consensus.” 
But in a case where the son’s children do not 
    inherit, it is recommended to make a will in their favour, so long as it does not exceed one-third of the estate, especially if they are poor and 
    in need. 
In conclusion: 
The son’s children may inherit from their 
    grandfather on condition that he does not have any living son (whether this son is their father or their paternal uncle), in which case they do 
    not inherit. The scholars are agreed on this point. 
The Muslim should believe that whatever 
    Allaah has decreed is wise, just and merciful, even if they cannot see that, and that Allaah prescribes for His slaves that which is in their best 
    interests and will bring them prosperity and happiness.

She has a male cousin (son of paternal uncle) in her homeland who, whenever he is alone with her, touches her, kisses her, enters her room and locks the door, etc, but he has not committed zina with her, praise be to Allaah. She does not like what he is doing and she feels upset and regrets what is happening. She wants to know what she should do because she is going to travel there soon.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly what your cousin is doing to you 
    is clearly haraam and a great evil, because that is only permissible with a wife with whom Allaah has permitted intimacy. 
What you must do is to denounce that and 
    refuse, and do not be a partner in the sin. A man usually cannot do that except with the consent of the woman. 
You should note that a male cousin is a 
    stranger to you, like any other non-mahram. It is not permissible for him to be alone with you or for you to uncover any part of your body in 
    front of him. He is enjoined to lower his gaze and refrain from looking at you, and you are enjoined to do likewise. 
A person who transgresses the sacred limits 
    set by Allaah must be rebuked and spoken to harshly, and you should threaten to tell your family and his. 
If he tries to grab hold of you, you must 
    push him back and run away from him. 
Beware of taking the matter lightly or being 
    soft in the way in which you deal with him, for the Shaytaan may make this sin attractive to you and you may agree to it, in which case you would 
    become subject to the wrath and punishment of Allaah.  
Unfortunately many people are careless about 
    protecting their daughters and sons, and they make it too easy for them to fall into this kind of sin, especially with regard to cousins, because 
    they are ignorant of the obligation to be covered in front of them, or because their faith and protective jealousy is weak. Allaah is the One 
    Whose help we seek. 
You have to repent to Allaah from this haraam 
    action; simply regretting it is not enough. Rather you must repent sincerely from committing sin and resolve not to go back to it. 
You must also avoid the reasons that may lead 
    you to commit this haraam action, such as being alone with your cousin, shaking hands with him, meeting him and talking to him. You must avoid him 
    completely, so as to ward off evil and prevent immorality, and close the door to fitnah and sin.

I gave it some thought, and came up with an answer, but would like your comments too before communicating to him the answer. I wouldn't like to tell you about my answer since it might affect your original thinking.",,,"Praise be to Allah.All people should know that Allah is All Wise, and that there is great wisdom behind His commands and decrees. He may let His slaves or some of them know the wisdom behind them, or it may be concealed from them as a test and a trial. 
What He decrees in general matters happens for a general reason, such as sending the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Allah has told us that He sent him as a Mercy to the worlds. And similarly He created the jinn and mankind so that they might believe in Him and worship Him alone. 
Ibn Taymiyah said: 
Based on this, everything that He does, we know that there is wisdom behind it. This is sufficient for us in general terms, even if we do not know the details. Our lack of knowledge about the details of His wisdom is like our lack of knowledge about the details of His Essence. Just as it is proven that His attributes are perfect but we cannot know how His Essence is, so we do not reject what we know and are sure of (that He is perfect) because of what we do not know (the details of His perfection). Similarly we know that He is All-Wise in all that He does and commands. The fact that we may not know the wisdom behind some minor decrees and issues should not undermine the basic principle of what we know of His wisdom. So we should not deny what we know of His wisdom because we do not know all the details of His wisdom. We know that whoever realizes the brilliance of mathematicians, doctors and grammarians but does not share their attributes by virtue of which they deserve prominence, cannot criticize what they say because he does not comprehend what they are saying. People are less likely to understand the wisdom of Allah in His creation than the common man is to understand mathematics, medicine and grammar. So objecting to Allah’s wisdom is more ignorant and the one who does that is worse off than an ignorant man who criticizes mathematics, medicine and grammar without having any knowledge of these disciplines.  
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 6/128 
Undoubtedly in Allah’s allowing children to suffer there is great wisdom which may be hidden from some people, thus they object to the Divine decree and the Shaytaan takes advantage of this issue to turn him away from the truth and right guidance. 
Among the reasons why Allah allows children to suffer are the following: 
1-It is a means to show that the child is sick or in pain; if it were not for that suffering it would not be known what sickness he is suffering from.
2-The crying that is caused by the pain brings great benefits to the child’s body.
3-Learning lessons: the family of this child may be committing haraam actions or neglecting obligatory duties, but when they see the suffering of their child, that prompts them to give up those haraam actions such as consuming riba, committing zina, not praying or smoking, especially if the child’s suffering is due to an illness that they caused, as happens in the case of some of the haraam things mentioned above.
4-Thinking about the Hereafter, for there is no true happiness and peace except in Paradise; there is no suffering and pain there, only good health, well-being and happiness. And thinking about Hell, for that is the abode of eternal and never-ending pain and suffering. So one will do that which will bring him nearer to Paradise and take him further away from Hell.
Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah said: 
Then think about the wisdom of Allah in causing children to cry a lot, and the benefits that that brings to them. The doctors and naturalists have attested to the benefits of that and the wisdom behind it. They said: There is moisture in children’s brains which, if it were to remain in their brains, would cause a great deal of harm. So crying draws that moisture out and drains it from their brains, which makes them stronger and healthier.  
Moreover, crying and yelling widens the breathing passages and veins, and strengthens them, and it strengthens the nerves. 
How greatly do children benefit from the crying and yelling that we hear from them. If this is the wisdom with regard to crying that is caused by pain and the wisdom behind this never crossed your mind, the same applies to the suffering of children and its causes and good consequences.  There is a great deal of wisdom that may be hidden from most of the people and they are greatly confused about it. 
Miftaah Daar al-Sa’aadah, 2/228. 
He also said: 
 These pains are one of the inherent features of man’s development from which no man or animal can be free. If man were free of pain he would not be a man, rather he would be an angel or some other creature. 
Children’s pain is not more difficult than the pain experienced by grownups, but grownups have become accustomed to pain so it is no longer a big issue for them. What a great difference there is between what a child suffers and what a rational adult suffers. 
All of that is one of the main aspects of the human condition. If man were not created like that he would be a different creature. What do you think if a child gets hungry or thirsty or cold or tired – is it something that he was singled out for and tested with that the grownups are not tested with?  Man – and indeed animals – have been created on this basis. 
They said: If someone were to ask: Why has man been created thus? Why was he not created without this vulnerability to pain and suffering? 
This is a flawed question, because Allah has created him in a world of trials from a weak substance. So he is vulnerable to diseases and suffering, and Allah has created him in such a way that he is vulnerable to all kinds of pain… 
The fact that these pains and pleasures coexist is one of the signs of the Hereafter, for divine wisdom has decreed that there should be two abodes: an abode that is devoted fully to pleasure, in which there is no pain at all, and an abode that is devoted fully to pain in which there is no pleasure at all. The former abode is Paradise and the latter abode is Hell.

It is also essential that the clothing be wide and loose so that it covers all the body, and it should be thick so that it is not see-through. 
You should advise your family and explain to them the necessity of adhering to that which Allaah has prescribed and enjoined. Explain that to your husband also, for he is responsible before Allaah and is required to protect you and have protective jealousy concerning you. 
Ask Allaah to protect you and to guide your family to that which is good; remain steadfast in what you are doing even if that makes them angry and upset.
