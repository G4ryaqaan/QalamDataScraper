20802,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20802,Intercourse with a slave woman is not regarded as zina (adultery),"Hadith 3.718 : I saw Abu Said and asked him about coitus interrupts. Abu Said said, ""We went with Allah's Apostle, in the Ghazwa of Bani Al-Mustaliq and we captured some of the 'Arabs as captives, and the long separation from our wives was pressing us hard and we wanted to practice coitus interruptus. We asked Allah's Apostle (whether it was permissible). He said, ""It is better for you not to do so. No soul, (that Allah has) destined to exist, up to the Day of Resurrection, but will definitely come into existence.""

Does this mean that the Companions of the Prophet (SAW) didn't commit adultery when they practiced 'azl with the captive girls?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
This hadeeth was narrated by al-Bukhaari 
    (2542) from Ibn Muhayreez who said: I saw Abu Sa’eed (may Allaah be pleased with him) and I asked him. He said: We went out with the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on the campaign of Banu al-Mustaliq, and we captured some prisoners from among the Arabs. 
    We desired women and the period of abstention was hard for us, and we wanted to engage in ‘azl (coitus interruptus). We asked the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he said, “There is no point in doing that, for there is no soul which Allaah has 
    decreed should exist until the Day of Resurrection but it will come into existence.”
    According to another report, They captured some female prisoners and wanted to be intimate with them without them becoming pregnant. They asked 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about ‘azl and he said, “There is no point in doing that, for Allaah has decreed who 
    should be created until the Day of Resurrection.” 
This hadeeth was also narrated by Muslim 
    (1438), whose version says: We captured some women of the Arabs and we had been abstinent for a long time; and we wanted to be able to sell them, 
    but we wanted to engage in intimacy with coitus interruptus. We said, “Shall we do that when the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) is among us without asking him about it?” So we asked the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    and he said, “There is no point in doing that, for Allaah has not decreed that any soul should be created until the Day of Resurrection but it 
    will come into existence.” 
It may be understood from the hadeeth that 
    those who wanted to engage in ‘azl did so for two reasons: they did not want the women to become pregnant, and they wanted to be able to sell them 
    – if a slave woman got pregnant she could not be sold. 
It may also be understood that ‘azl (coitus 
    interruptus) does not change anything. If Allaah decrees that a child should be born, water (semen) will come out before the man realizes it. 
Secondly: 
Allaah has permitted intimacy with a slave 
    woman if the man owns her. This is not regarded as adultery as suggested in the question. Allaah says, describing the believers (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 
“those who guard their chastity (i.e. 
    private parts, from illegal sexual acts)
Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their right hands possess,__ 
    for then, they are free from blame”
[al-Mu’minoon 23:5]
What is meant by “those whom their right 
    hands possess” is slave women or concubines.  See also question no. 10382,
    12562. 
Once this is understood, it should be noted 
    that what is suggested in the question, that this was zina, never occurred to the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them). What they were 
    asking about was the ruling on practicing ‘azl with the slave women whom they had acquired in the course of jihad. 
Moreover ‘azl may be done with a concubine or 
    with a wife, if she agrees to that. See question no. 11885.

20803,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20803,Reward for memorizing Qur’aan,What is the reward for becoming a Haafiz?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Whoever memorizes Qur’aan and acts upon it, Allaah will reward him and honour him greatly for that, so that he will rise in status in Paradise to a level commensurate with what he memorized of the Book of Allaah.
Al-Tirmidhi (2914) and Abu Dawood (1464) 
    narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “It will be said to the companion of 
    the Qur’aan: Recite and rise in status, recite as you used to recite in the world, for your status will be at the last verse that you recite.” 
    This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 5/218, no. 2240, after which he said: 
Note that what is meant by the “companion of 
    the Qur’aan” is the one who memorizes it by heart, as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “The one who knows more 
    Qur’aan should lead the people in prayer,” meaning the one who has memorized the most.  The differentiation in status in Paradise will depend on 
    how much was memorized in this world, not how much one will recite on that day as some people imagine. This clearly points to the virtue of the 
    hafiz who has memorized the Qur’aan, but that is subject to the condition that he memorizes it for the sake of Allaah, not for worldly purposes or 
    financial gain. Otherwise the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Most of the hypocrites of my ummah are among those 
    who have memorized Qur’aan.” 
Concerning the virtue of the hafiz who 
    memorizes the Qur’aan, al-Bukhaari (4937) narrated from ‘Aa’ishah that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The 
    likeness of the one who reads Qur’aan and memorizes it is that he is with the righteous honourable scribes. The likeness of the one who reads it 
    and tries hard to memorize it even though it is difficult for him, he will have two rewards.” 
For the hafiz who has memorized the Qur’aan, 
    praying qiyaam al-layl is easy. And the Qur’aan will intercede for him on the Day of Resurrection, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) said: “Fasting and the Qur’aan will intercede for a person on the Day of Resurrection. Fasting will say, ‘O Lord, I 
    deprived him of food and desires during the day, so let me intercede for him.’ The Qur’aan will say, ‘O Lord I deprived him of his sleep at night, 
    so let me intercede for him.’ Then they will both intercede for him.” Narrated by Ahmad, al-Tabaraani and al-Haakim; classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 3882 
And Allaah knows best. 
It should be noted here that there is a weak 
    (da’eef) hadeeth that is quoted concerning the virtue of memorizing Qur’aan. This hadeeth says, “The bearer of the Qur’aan, if he regards what it permits as halaal and what it forbids as haraam, he will intercede for ten of his family members on the Day of Resurrection, all of whom deserved to enter Hell.” This was narrated by al-Bayhaqi in Shu’ab al-Eemaan (The Branches of Faith) from Jaabir; it was classed as da’eef by al-Albaani in Da’eef al-Jaami’.",Islam Q&A

2 – Matters concerning which the scholars

“(And) if you differ in anything amongst

[al-Nisa’ 4:59]
Referring to Allaah means referring to His

20805,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20805,Meat from dubious restaurants,"I know that this question has been addressed, but I am still confused as to all the circumstances in which it is permissible.  Basically, is it permissible to eat meat from restaurants if it is not known whether the name of God has been pronounced at the time of slaughtering of the animal.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If these restaurants are in a country where the slaughter of meat is taken care of by Muslims or People of the Book (i.e., Jews and Christians), or the restaurant owners take care of the slaughter themselves and they are Muslims or people of the Book, then it is permissible to eat there, even if we do not know whether they mentioned the name of Allaah over the slaughter or not, because the basic principle is that their meat is allowed. Al-Bukhaari (2057) narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that some people said, “O Messenger of Allaah, some people bring meat to us and we do not know whether they mentioned the name of Allaah over it or not.” The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Say the 
    name of Allaah over it and eat it.” 
But if the slaughter of meat is taken care of 
    by people other than Muslims or people of the Book, such as atheists and Hindus, then it is not permissible to eat it. 
It should be noted that meat slaughtered by a 
    Muslim or a Jew or Christian is permissible if it was slaughtered in the manner prescribed in sharee’ah or if we do not know how it was 
    slaughtered. But if we know that it was slaughtered in a way other than that prescribed in sharee’ah, such as by strangling, electric shock, etc, 
    then it is maytah or dead meat and it is haraam to eat it regardless of whether the one who killed it was a Muslim or a kaafir, because 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Forbidden to you (for food) are: Al‑Maitah (the dead animals — 
    cattle — beast not slaughtered), blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which Allaah’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering (that which 
    has been slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allaah, or has been slaughtered for idols) and that which has been killed by strangling, or by 
    a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by the goring of horns — and that which has been (partly) eaten by a wild animal — unless you are able 
    to slaughter it (before its death)”
[al-Maa'idah 5:3]
Shaykh Ibn Baaz in Fataawa Islamiyyah, 
    3/414
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
One of the following three scenarios must 
    apply to this meat: 
1 – We know that it has been slaughtered in 
    the proper manner. This meat is halaal. 
2 – We know that it has not been slaughtered 
    in the proper manner. This meat is haraam. 
3 – We are not sure; we do not know whether 
    it has been slaughtered in the proper manner or not. The ruling in this case is that the meat is halaal, and we do not have to ask about how it 
    was killed, or whether the name of Allaah was mentioned over it or not. Rather it seems from the Sunnah that it is better not to ask or try to 
    find out. Hence when they said to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “we do not know whether they mentioned the name of 
    Allaah over it or not,” he did not say to them, Ask them whether they mentioned the name of Allaah over them or not, rather he said: “Say the name 
    of Allaah over it yourselves, and eat it.” This tasmiyah or saying of the name of Allaah which the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) told them to do is not the tasmiyah of slaughter, because the slaughter is over and done with. Rather it is the tasmiyah of eating, 
    because what is prescribed is for the person who is eating to say the name of Allaah when he eats. The correct view regarding saying the name of 
    Allaah when eating is that it is obligatory, because the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined it, and 
    because if a person does not say the name of Allaah, the Shaytaan shares his food and drink. 
If a person wants to be cautious and forego 
    eating this meat, there is nothing wrong with that, but there is also nothing wrong with eating it.

Is your marriage predestined?","Praise be to Allah.Belief in al-qadar
Belief in al-qadar (the divine will and decree ) is one of the pillars of faith. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, when he answered Jibril’s question about faith: “(It means) believing in Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers and the Last Day, and to believe in al-qadar (the divine decree) both good and bad.” 
What is al-qadar?
What is meant by al-qadar is that Allah has decreed all things from eternity and knows that they will happen at times that are known to Him, and in specific ways, and that He has written that and willed it, and they happen according to what He has decreed. [al-Qada wa’l-Qadar by Dr ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Mahmoud, p. 39] 
Basics of belief in al-Qadar
Belief in al-qadar is based on four things: 

Knowledge, i.e., that Allah knows what His creation will do, by virtue of His eternal knowledge. 
Writing, i.e., that Allah has written the destiny of all creatures in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz. 
Will, i.e., that what Allah wills happens and what He does not will does not happen. There is no movement in the heavens or on earth but it happens by His will. 
Creation and formation, i.e., that Allah is the Creator of all things, including the actions of His slaves. They do their actions in a real sense, and He is the Creator of them and of their actions. 

Whoever believes in these four believes in al-qadar. 
Reference to Al-Qadar in the Quran
The Quran affirms these things in numerous verses, such as the verses in which He says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And with Him are the keys of the Ghayb (all that is hidden), none knows them but He. And He knows whatever there is in the land and in the sea; not a leaf falls, but He knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record” [al-An'am 6:59]
“No calamity befalls on the earth or in yourselves but it is inscribed in the Book of Decrees (Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz) before We bring it into existence. Verily, that is easy for Allah” [al-Hadid 57:22] 
“And you cannot will unless (it be) that Allah wills, the Lord of the ‘Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists)” [al-Takwir 81:29] 
“Verily, We have created all things with Qadar (Divine Preordainment of all things before their creation as written in the Book of Decrees Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz)” [al-Qamar 54:49]

Muslim (2653) narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Allah wrote down the decrees of creation fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth.” He said: “And His Throne was upon the water.”  
Was al-qadar invented by al-Jahm ibn Safwan? 
Hence it should be clear to you that the view that al-qadar was invented by al-Jahm ibn Safwan is a view that has no sound basis. Al-qadar was not created, rather creation comes under the heading of belief in al-qadar. 
Al-Jahm went to extremes in affirming the divine will and decree, and claimed that people are compelled to do what they do and have no choice. This is a false view. 
Belief of Ahl al-Sunnah wa'l-Jamaa'ah about al-Qadar
The belief of Ahl al-Sunnah wa'l-Jama'ah is that a person has freedom of will , and hence he will be rewarded or punished. But his will is subject to the will of Allah, and nothing can take place in the universe that is not willed by Allah. 
What some people say, that we have the choice to follow whatever path we want but at the end of this path you will find what Allah has decreed for you, is a correct view. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, We showed him the way, whether he be grateful or ungrateful” [al-Insan 76:3] 
“And shown him the two ways (good and evil)?” [al-Balad 90:10] 
“And say: “The truth is from your Lord.” Then whosoever wills, let him believe; and whosoever wills, let him disbelieve” [al-Kahf 18:29]
View of Ahl al-Sunnah with regard to man’s deeds
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining the view of Ahl al-Sunnah with regard to man’s deeds:  
“People act in a real sense, and Allah is the Creator of their actions. A person may be a believer or a kafir, righteous or immoral, he may pray and fast. People have control over their actions, and they have their own will, and Allah is the Creator of their control and will, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“To whomsoever among you who wills to walk straight. And you cannot will unless (it be) that Allah wills, the Lord of the ‘Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists)” [al-Takwir 81:28-29]” (al-Wasitiyyah ma’a Sharh Harras, p. 65)
Is your marriage predestined? 
Marriage is one of the things that Allah has decreed. The person whom you will marry is known to Allah: He knows who he is, when he was born, where and when he will die, how he will be towards you, and other details. All of that is known to Allah and He has written it in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz (the Book of Decrees), and it will inevitably come to pass as Allah has decreed. 
If Allah has decreed that you will marry one person, but you choose someone else, then no matter how long it takes, you will marry that person. But your marriage to someone else is also decreed, because there is nothing that is not decreed by Allah. It may be decreed for a woman to marry So and So the son of So and So, and he comes to propose marriage but she refuses him, and marries someone else, then he (the second man) dies or divorces her, then she accepts the first one. All of that is decreed, and it is decreed for her to marry So and So the son of So and So after initially refusing him and after some experience or trials etc. 
It may be decreed for a woman that a righteous man will propose marriage to her, but she will refuse him and he will never come back to her, and she will marry and live with someone else who is more or less righteous, according to what Allah has decreed. 
Because man does not know what is decreed for him, what he must do is to adhere to Shari`ah and abide by its commands and prohibitions, and to seek the help of Allah and pray to Him for guidance (istikharah ) concerning all his affairs, whilst implementing the means, one of the most important of which is consulting sincere people who have relevant experience. 
If a righteous man proposes marriage to a woman, she should pray to Allah for guidance (istikharah) and agree to marry him. If things then go smoothly, this is an indication that what is good for her is to marry him.  
In conclusion, man should study the Shari`ah of Allah and follow the commands of Allah even if he feels reluctant, and avoid what Allah has forbidden even if he is attached to it. All goodness is to be found in obeying Shari`ah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Jihad(fighting in Allah’s Cause) is ordained for you (Muslims) though you dislike it, and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allah knows but you do not know” [al-Baqarah 2:216]
He should not look at al-qadar as an excuse to ignore commands and do forbidden things, rather he should look at it in a way that will make him content with whatever painful experiences happen to him.

However, where i live, the salat in the masjid is held at the earliest possible time for isha instead of the latest possible time. How would one reconcile this problem. ALso, is it allowed to talk after isha?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is makrooh to speak after ‘Isha’ prayer unless that is for a reason, or speaking about some good topic, because it was narrated in al-Saheehayn from Abi Barzah that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to dislike sleeping before ‘Isha’ and speaking afterwards. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 568; Muslim, 647. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary: 
The scholars said: The reason for it being makrooh to sleep beforehand is that one risks missing the prayer by sleeping too deeply, or one risks missing the preferred and best time for the prayer, and lest the people take this matter lightly and sleep and miss the prayer in congregation. 
The reason why it is makrooh to speak afterwards is because that leads to people staying up late at night and there is the fear that sleep may then prevent them from praying qiyaam al-layl and making dhikr, or from praying Fajr during the permissible time or the best and preferred time. And because staying up late at night is a cause of laziness during the day with regard to religious duties, acts of worship and worldly interests. The scholars said: the kind of speech that is makrooh after ‘Isha’ is that which serves no interest. As for speech which serves a good interest, it is not makrooh, such as studying, telling stories of the righteous, speaking to a guest or to a bride to put them at their ease, a man speaking kindly to his wife and children or for a reason, speaking to travellers about protecting them or their luggage, speaking to reconcile people and intercede with them for a good purpose, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, guiding people to do good, etc. All of these are not makrooh. There are saheeh ahaadeeth which speak of some of the things we have mentioned, and the rest come under the same heading.  What is meant by it being makrooh to speak after ‘Isha’ is speaking after praying ‘Isha’, not after the time for ‘Isha’ begins. The scholars are agreed that it is makrooh to speak after the prayer except speech in which there is goodness, as we have mentioned above. 
And he said in his book al-Adhkaar (p. 533): 
With regard to the ahaadeeth which indicate a concession allowing speaking about the things mentioned above, there are many such reports. For example, the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar in al-Saheehayn which says that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed ‘Isha’ at the end of his life, and when he had said the salaam he said: “Do you see this night of yours? One hundred years from now, no one who is on the face of the earth today will be left.” 
And it was reported in al-Saheehayn from Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) delayed the prayer until it was nearly midnight, then the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went out and led them in prayer. When he finished his prayer he said to those who were with him: “Wait a moment. Receive the glad tidings that by the blessing of Allaah to you, no one has prayed at this hour except you.”  
In Saheeh al-Bukhaari it is narrated from Anas that they waited for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he came to them when it was nearly midnight and led them in prayer, meaning ‘Isha’. [Anas] said: Then he addressed us, saying, “The people have prayed then gone to bed, but you have still been in a state of prayer so long as you were waiting for the prayer.” 
Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated that he stayed overnight in the house of his maternal aunt Maymoonah and said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed ‘Isha’, then he went in and spoke with his wife. 
‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Abi Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated the story of his visitors and how he stayed away from them until he prayed ‘Isha’, then he came and spoke to them and to his wife and son. These two hadeeth are in al-Saheehayn, and there are many similar reports, more than can be listed, but what we have quoted here is enough, praise be to Allaah. 
To sum up the above: 
Speaking after ‘Isha’ prayer is permissible and is not makrooh if it serves a purpose. But if it serves no useful purpose then it is makrooh, but is not haraam, unless the speech itself is haraam such as backbiting and gossip.

Is there anything wrong with doing these types of programs for youth males in the masjid. They last from Isha till fajr. In these programs, there are lectures, and different types of activities including basketball.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with meeting to 
    organize useful lectures and some other good and permissible kinds of activities. 
We ask Allaah to help those who do these 
    things to do that which He loves and which pleases Him, and to bless their efforts. 
With regard to the sporting activities that 
    you mentioned, if it is possible to do them during the day, that is preferable, because talking after ‘Isha’ prayers is makrooh, except if that 
    serves a purpose. But if time is short and the aim is to provide relaxation so that the people can focus on the lectures, then there is nothing 
    wrong with it in sha Allaah. See also question no. 20811. 
With regard to qiyaam al-layl, gathering for 
    this purpose is not prescribed, unless: 
1-That happens occasionally and is not something ongoing
2-It happens without prior agreement
But in Ramadaan it is prescribed to pray 
    qiyaam in congregation on every night of the month. See question no. 38021. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said in al-Mughni (1/442): 
“It is permissible to pray voluntary prayers in congregation and individually, because the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did both, but most of his voluntary prayers were offered individually. He led Hudhayfah 
    in praying a voluntary prayer once, and Ibn ‘Abbaas once, and Anas and his mother and the orphan once, and he led his companions in the house of 
    ‘Utbaan once, and he led them during the night in Ramadaan three times. These reports are all saheeh and jayyid.” 
The naafil prayers offered in congregation in 
    these ahaadeeth took place without any prior agreement. Hence Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
“With regard to a group agreeing to meet on a 
    certain night to pray qiyaam al-layl, this is bid’ah, because praying qiyaam in congregation is not prescribed, unless that happens occasionally 
    without prior agreement and unintentionally, as happened with the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with ‘Abd-Allaah ibn 
    ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him).” 
Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih 
    al-‘Uthaymeen, Kitaab al-‘Ilm, p. 208. 
So our advice to those who organize such activities is either to limit it to lectures and other 
    activities, or to leave some time for those who want to pray qiyaam al-layl, and let each of them pray individually.

20815,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20815,A Christian Wants to Become Muslim and is Asking about the Prayer,"I have not read about the prayers anywhere yet, at least how they are performed. (movements, speech ie: what is said if anything specific). How can one convert not knowing Arabic? Isn't this the only language the Qu'ran should be read and recited in?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Prayer is the greatest of the pillars of Islam after the Shahaadatayn (twin declaration of faith). What is obligatory is five prayers during the day and night. This establishes a relationship between a person and his Lord, in which a person finds peace, happiness and contentment, as he stands before his Lord and speaks to Him, and calls upon Him and converses with Him, and prostrates before Him, complains to Him of his worries and sorrows, and turns to Him at times of calamity. 
Whatever has been said to you about the prayer, nothing can really describe how great and important it is, and no one can appreciate it except the one who tastes its joy and spends his nights in prayer and fills his days with it. It is the delight of those who believe in the Oneness of God and the joy of the believers. 
Allah has prescribed purification before the prayer, so that the body is cleansed of impurities and sins are washed away. For the Muslim does not wash any of his limbs but sins are washed away with the water, or with the last drop of water, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us. 
With regard to how the prayer is done, it involves standing, saying “Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great)”, reciting Quran, bowing and prostrating. All you have to do is go to an Islamic Centre in your country to see how the Muslims pray and learn about it.  
The fact that a person does not know Arabic does not affect his Islam, and it does not deprive him of the honour of belonging to the faith. How many people’s hearts are opened to Islam every day, who do not know even one letter of Arabic. 
There are thousands of Muslims in India, Pakistan, the Philippines and elsewhere who have memorized the Quran by heart, but not one of them can hold a lengthy conversation in Arabic. That is because Allah has made the Quran easy, and has made it easy for people to memorize it, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We have indeed made the Quran easy to understand and remember; then is there any one who will remember (or receive admonition)?” [al-Qamar 54:17]
In the prayer the Muslim must recites Soorat al-Faatihah in Arabic, so he has to learn it. If he is unable to do so but he knows one verse of it, he should repeat it seven times, which is the number of verses in Soorat al-Faatihah. If he is unable to do that then he should say: “Subhaan Allah, wa’l-hamdu Lillaah, wa laa ilaaha ill-Allah, wa Allahu akbar, wa laa ilaaha ill-Allah, wa laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah (Glory be to Allah, praise be to Allah, there is no god except Allah, Allah is Most Great, there is no god but Allah, and there is no power and no strength except with Allah).” See question no. 5410. 
The matter is easy, praise be to Allah. How many people have learned to speak a language other than their own very well, even two or three languages, so how can they be unable to learn thirty or forty words that they need in their prayers? 
If the language was really an obstacle, you would not find millions of Muslims who are not Arabs, who perform the acts of worship with ease, praise be to Allah. 
So hasten to enter Islam, for no one knows when his appointed time (i.e. death) will come. May Allah save you and keep you safe from His wrath and punishment. 
All you have to do to enter this great religion is to say, “Ash-hadu an laa ilaaha ill-Allah wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan ‘abduhu wa Rasooluhu (I bear witness that there is no god except Allah and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger),” and you will find people among your Muslim brothers who will help you to learn the prayer and other matters of Islam.

Is is right? is so what is the DALEEL for that?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Saying salam when entering the house is mustahabb, not obligatory, whether there is anyone in the house or not. 
Abu Dawood (5096) narrated that Abu Maalik al-Ash’ari said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When a man enters his house, let him say, ‘Allahumma inni as’aluka khayr al-mawlaj wa khayr al-makhraj. Bismillaah walajna wa Bismillaah kharajna wa ‘ala Allahi rabbina tawakalna (O Allah, I ask You for the best entering and the best exiting. In the name of Allah we enter and in the name of Allah we leave, and in Allah our Lord we put our trust),’ then he should say salam to his family.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 225. 
Al-Tirmidhi (2698) narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to me, ‘O my son, when you enter upon your family and say salam, it will be a blessing for you and the members of your household. Al-Albani said in Takhreej al-Mishkaat (4652): this hadeeth is hasan when all its isnaads are taken into account. 
These two hadeeth show that it is mustahabb for a man to greet his family with salam when he enters his house. 
With regard to it being mustahabb for a man to say salam to himself when entering a house where there is no one, the scholars quoted evidence for that. 
1 – The general meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But when you enter the houses, greet one another with a greeting from Allah (i.e. say: As-salamu ‘Alaykum — peace be on you), blessed and good”
[al-Noor 24:61]
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book al-Adhkaar (p. 49): 
It is mustahabb to say Bismillaah (in the name of Allah) and to remember Allah a great deal, and to say salam, whether there is any human being in the house or not, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But when you enter the houses, greet one another with a greeting from Allah (i.e. say: As-salamu ‘Alaykum — peace be on you), blessed and good”
[al-Noor 24:61]
Al-Haafiz said: 
It comes under the general meaning of spreading salam, and saying salam to oneself when entering a place where there is no one, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But when you enter the houses, greet one another with a greeting from Allah (i.e. say: As-salamu ‘Alaykum — peace be on you)…”
[al-Noor 24:61]
Some mufassireen – such as Ibn Jareer – interpreted the aayah as meaning “greet one another” [as in the translation of the meaning quoted here]. This is like the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And do not kill yourselves (nor kill one another)”
[al-Nisa’ 4:29]
Al-Qurtubi said: The more correct view is to say that this is general and applies to everyone who enters a house. If there is a Muslim person in the house he should say “Al-salamu ‘alaykum wa rahmat-Allahi wa barakaatuhu (peace be upon you, and the mercy of Allah, and His blessings).” If there is no one there, he should say, “Al-salamu ‘alayna wa ‘ala ‘ibaad-Illaah il-saaliheen (peace be upon us and upon the righteous slaves of Allah).” If there is someone in the house who is not a Muslim, he should say, “Al-salam ‘ala man ittaba’a al-huda (peace be upon those who follow true guidance)” or “Al-salamu ‘alayna wa ‘ala ‘ibaad-Illaah il-saaliheen (peace be upon us and upon the righteous slaves of Allah).” 
2 – That is narrated from some of the Sahaabah. 
Al-Bukhaari narrated in al-Adab al-Mufrad (1055) that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “When you enter an uninhabited house, say “Al-salamu ‘alayna wa ‘ala ‘ibaad-Illaah il-saaliheen (peace be upon us and upon the righteous slaves of Allah).” 
Al-Haafiz said: Its isnaad is hasan; and it was classed as hasan by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Adab al-Mufrad, 806. 
Mujaahid said: When you enter the mosque, say, “Al-salam ‘ala Rasool-Illaah (Peace be upon the Messenger of Allah),” and when you enter upon your family, greet them with salam, and when you enter a house in which there is no one, say “Al-salamu ‘alayna wa ‘ala ‘ibaad-Illaah il-saaliheen (peace be upon us and upon the righteous slaves of Allah).”

Does one’s soul meet with the souls of his family and relatives?

Types of souls in the grave","Praise be to Allah.Do Souls Meet in Barzakh?
Yes, it is proven that the souls of the believers meet and visit one another. There follow some of the hadiths which indicate that, as well as some of the fatwas of the scholars on this matter. 
Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When the believer is dying, the angels of mercy come to him with white silk and say: ‘Come out content and with the pleasure of Allah upon you to the mercy of Allah, fragrance and a Lord Who is not angry.’ So it comes out like the best fragrance of musk. They pass him from one to another until they bring him to the gate of heaven, where they say: ‘How good is this fragrance that has come to you from the earth!’ Then the souls of the believers come to him and they rejoice more over him than any one of you rejoices when his absent loved one comes to him. They ask him: ‘What happened to So and So, what happened to So and So?’ They say: ‘Let him be, for he was in the hardship of the world. When he says, ‘Did he not come here?’ They say: ‘He was taken to the pit (of Hell).’ When the kafir is dying, the angels of punishment come to him with sackcloth and say: ‘Come out discontented and subject to divine wrath to the punishment of Allah. So it comes out like the foulest stench of a corpse. They bring him to the gates of the earth, where they say: ‘How foul is this stench!’ Then they bring him to the souls of the disbelievers.” (Narrated by al-Nasai, 1833; classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Sahihah, 2758) 
Does one’s soul meet with the souls of his family and relatives?
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
“Does his soul meet with the souls of his family and relatives? According to the hadith narrated from Abu Ayyub al-Ansari and others of the salaf, and narrated by Abu Hatim in al-Sahih from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him):  “When his soul is taken up it is met by the souls who ask him about the living and they say to one another: ‘Let him rest.’ And they say: ‘What happened to So and So?’ And he says: ‘He did a righteous deed.’ They say: ‘What happened to So and So?’ and he says: ‘Has he not come to you?’ They say: ‘No.’ They say: ‘He was taken to the Pit (of Hell).’” 
And because the deeds of the living are shown to the dead, Abu’l-Darda used to say: “O Allah, I seek refuge with You from doing any deed that would shame me before ‘Abd-Allah ibn Rawahah.” This is how they meet when he comes and they ask him questions and they answer him. 
Where do the souls settle?
With regard to where they settle, that depends on their status before Allah. For the one who is among those who are close to Allah (al-muqarrabin – cf. al-Waqi’ah 56:88), his status will be higher than those of the Right Hand (cf. al-Waqi’ah 56:90). The one who is higher may descend to the one who is lower but the one who is lower cannot ascend to the one who is higher, thus they will gather when Allah wills as they used to gather in this world, despite their differences in status, and they will visit one another. 
That will happen whether their places in which they are buried in this world are far apart or close together. Souls may meet even though their places of burial are far apart, or they may be separated even though their places of burial are close together. A believer may be buried beside a disbeliever, but the soul of the former will be in Paradise whilst the soul of the latter is in Hell. Two men may be sitting or sleeping in the same place, but the heart of one is blessed and the heart of the other is tormented, and there is no connection between the two souls. As the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Souls are troops collected together and those who got along with each other (in the heaven from whence they come) would have an affinity with one another (in this world) and those amongst them who opposed each other (in heaven) would also be divergent (in the world).” (Narrated by Muslim, 2638; Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 24/368) 
Types of souls in the grave
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
The second issue is whether the souls of the dead meet one another, visit one another and talk to one another. 
This is a good question. The answer is that souls are of two types: those that are punished and those that are blessed.  Those that are punished are too preoccupied with the torment that they are facing to visit and meet one another, but the souls that are blessed are free and are not detained, so they meet one another, visit one another and talk about what they used to do in this world and what happened to the people of this world. So each soul will be with its friends who did similar good deeds. The soul of our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is with the highest companions. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger - those will be with the ones upon whom Allah has bestowed favor of the prophets, the steadfast affirmers of truth, the martyrs and the righteous. And excellent are those as companions.” [al-Nisa 4:69]
This togetherness is confirmed in this world, in al-Barzakh and in the abode of reward (Paradise), and “A man will be with those whom he loves” in these three realms… Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“(It will be said to the pious — believers of Islamic Monotheism): ‘O (you) the one in (complete) rest and satisfaction! ‘Come back to your Lord,—  well-pleased (yourself) and well-pleasing (unto Him)! ‘Enter you then among My (honoured) slaves, ‘And enter you My Paradise!’” [al-Fajr 89:27-30] i.e., enter among them and be one of them. This is said to the soul at the time of death… And Allah has told us that the martyrs are: “are alive, with their Lord, and they have provision” [Al ‘Imran 3:169]; they “rejoice for the sake of those who have not yet joined them, but are left behind” [Al 'Imran 3:170] and “They rejoice in a grace and a bounty from Allah” [Al 'Imran 3:171]. 
This indicates that they will meet one another in three ways: 

they are with their Lord and are given provision, and if they are alive then they meet one another; 
they rejoice at the arrival of their brothers and their meeting with them; and
the word yastabshirun (translated as “rejoice”) implies that they pass the good news to one another.  (Al-Ruh, pp. 17-18) 

There are hadiths which state that the dead visit one another and we are commanded to make their shrouds beautiful because of that, but none of these hadiths are sahih. For example, the hadith of Abu Qatadah according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever takes the responsibility of preparing his brother for burial, let him make his shroud beautiful, for they visit one another in them.” (Shu’ab al-Iman, 7/10)

Capital punishment in Islam applies in the case of a person who meets any of the following conditions: 

The apostate . The apostate is one who disbelieves after being a Muslim, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever changes his religion, execute him.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6524. 
The married adulterer. The punishment in this case is stoning to death. 

Al-muhsan or the married person here means one who got married and had intercourse with his wife in the vagina, in a legitimate marriage in which both parties are free, of sound mind and adults. If a married man or woman commits adultery, then they are to be stoned to death, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Learn from me. Allah has given them a way out. If an unmarried person commits fornication with an unmarried person, (the punishment is) one hundred lashes and exile for one year. If a married person commits adultery with a married person, (the punishment is) one hundred lashes and stoning.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1690) 
And al-Bukhari (2725) and Muslim (1698) narrated from Abu Hurayrah and Zayd ibn Khalid al-Juhani (may Allah be pleased with them) that they said: “Two men from among the Bedouins came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, I adjure you by Allah to judge me according to the Book of Allah.’ The other disputant – who was smarter – said: ‘Yes, judge between us according to the Book of Allah and give me permission to speak first.’  
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘Speak.’ 
He said, ‘My son was employed by this man, and he committed adultery with his wife. I was told that the punishment for my son would be stoning, but that he could be ransomed for one hundred sheep and their offspring. I asked the people of knowledge and they told me that the punishment for my son would be one hundred lashes and exile for one year, and that this woman would be stoned.’  
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, I will judge between you according to the Book of Allah. The offspring and sheep will be returned (i.e., there is no ransom), and your son is to be given one hundred lashes and exiled for one year. O Unays [who was one of the Companions], go tomorrow to that woman and if she admits (this crime) then stone her.’ So he went to her the next day and she admitted it, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) issued orders that she be stoned. 

The murderer (one who kills deliberately). He is to be killed in retaliation (qisas) unless the victim’s next of kin let him off or agree to accept the diyah (blood money), because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“O you who believe! Al-Qisas (the Law of Equality in punishment) is prescribed for you in case of murder: the free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female. But if the killer is forgiven by the brother (or the relatives) of the killed against blood money, then adhering to it with fairness and payment of the blood money to heir should be made in fairness. This is an alleviation and a mercy from your Lord. So after this whoever transgresses the limits (i.e. kills the killer after taking the blood money), he shall have a painful torment.” [al-Baqarah 2:178]
“And there is (a saving of) life for you in Al-Qisas (the Law of Equality in punishment), O men of understanding, that you may become Al-Muttaqun (the pious).” [al-Baqarah 2:179] 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible (to shed) the blood of a Muslim who bears witness that there is no god but Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah, except in three cases: a married adulterer, a soul for a soul, or one who leaves the religion and splits from the jama’ah.”  (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6484; Muslim, 1676) 

Bandits, i.e., al-muharib, the one who wages war against Allah and His Messenger. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“The recompense of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be killed or crucified or their hands and their feet be cut off from opposite sides, or be exiled from the land. That is their disgrace in this world, and a great torment is theirs in the Hereafter.” [al-Maidah 5:33]

Spies . The spy is the one who spies on the Muslims and transmits information to their enemies. 

The evidence for that is the report narrated by al-Bukhari (3007) and Muslim (2494) which says that Hatib ibn Abi Balta’ah wrote to some of the mushrikin in Makkah telling them some information about the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O Hatib, what is this?” He said, “O Messenger of Allah, do not hasten to judge me. I was a man closely connected to Quraysh, but I did not belong to this tribe, while the other Muaajirin with you had their relatives in Makkah who would protect their families and property. So I wanted to make up for my lack of blood ties to them by doing them a favor so that they might protect my family. I did not do this because of disbelief or apostasy nor out of preferring kufr (disbelief) to Islam.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “He has told you the truth.” ‘Umar said, “O Messenger of Allah! Let me chop off the head of this hypocrite!” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “He was present at the battle of Badr, and you do not know, perhaps Allah looked at the people of Badr and said, ‘Do whatever you like, for I have forgiven you.’” 
The point in this hadith is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) agreed with ‘Umar that Hatib deserved to be executed for this action, but the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told him that there was a reason why he should not be killed, which is that he was one of those who was present at the battle of Badr. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said in Zad al-Ma’ad (2/115) concerning the hadith of Hatib ibn Abi Balta’ah: 
This was quoted as evidence by those who do not think that the Muslim spy should be killed, such as al-Shafi’i, Ahmad and Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on them). And it was quoted as evidence by those who think that the spy should be killed, such as Malik and Ibn ‘Aqil among the companions of Ahmad, and others. They said: This is because the reason for not killing him was that he had been present at Badr. If being Muslim was the reason for not killing him, he would not have given a reason that is more specific, which is the fact that he had been present at Badr. 
And he said elsewhere in Zad al-Ma’ad (3/422): 
“The correct view is that execution of a spy depends on the opinion of the ruler; if executing him is in the Muslims’ interests, he should be executed, but if letting him live serves a greater interest, then he should be allowed to live. And Allah knows best. 
The above also includes the one who does not pray, the one who practices witchcraft , and the heretic, because they come under the heading of “the one who leaves his religion and splits from the jama’ah.” 
With regard to the conditions of implementing this punishment, there are many. Each crime has its own specific conditions, details of which may be found in the books of fiqh.

There is no sin on you for eating pig meat without intending to, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And there is no sin on you concerning that in which you made a mistake, except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend. And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [al-Ahzab 33:5]

The Muslim should be cautious with regard to food, especially if he is in a non-Muslim country whose people eat impure foods. 
How to cleanse after eating pork
With regard to how to cleanse oneself of pig-related impurity , some scholars are of the view that it should be washed seven times, one of which should be with earth, by analogy with dogs. 
But the correct view is that pig-related impurity should be washed only once. Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on Muslim (Sharh Muslim): “Most of the scholars were of the view that pig-related impurity does not have to be washed seven times. This is the view of al-Shafi’i, and it has the strongest evidence.”  
This is what Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymein thought most likely to be correct, as he said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 1/495): “The jurists (may Allah have mercy on them) likened (pig-related) impurity to dog-related impurity, because pigs are dirtier than dogs, so the ruling should apply even more so.  
This is a weak analogy, because pigs are mentioned in the Quran and they existed at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and there is no report which likens them to dogs. So the correct view is that pig-related impurity is like any other kind of impurity, and there is no need to wash seven times, one of which should be with dust or dirt.”
 The correct view concerning washing other types of impurity is that whatever will remove the impurity is sufficient, and there is no specific number of times it must be washed.
No matter what the correct view with regard to cleansing oneself after touching pigs, you do not have to wash any part of your bodies now, and that does not have any effect on your prayers.

20846,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20846,When is intercourse haraam?,I would like to know on which nights of the Islamic month sexual intercourse is NOT allowed? This is in regard to the moon. Example - I heard that intercourse is not allowed on the evening of the new moon (per Hadith?). Are there other nights as well?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.What you have heard about intercourse not being allowed when seeing the new moon at the beginning of the month is not correct, and we do not know of any hadeeth concerning that. It is permissible for a man to have intercourse with his wife at any time, except when one of them is in ihraam for Hajj or ‘Umrah, or is fasting, so it is not allowed during the day when one of them is fasting, but it is allowed at night; it is also haraam when the woman is menstruating or bleeding following childbirth. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The Hajj (pilgrimage) is (in) the well-known (lunar year) months (i.e. the 10th month, the 11th month and the first ten days of the 12th month of the Islamic calendar, i.e. two months and ten days). So whosoever intends to perform Hajj therein (by assuming Ihraam), then he should not have sexual relations (with his wife), nor commit sin, nor dispute unjustly during the Hajj” [Al-Baqarah 2:197] 
“It is made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of As-Sawm (the fasts). They are Libaas [i.e. body-cover, or screen, or Sakan (i.e. you enjoy the pleasure of living with them)] for you and you are the same for them” [Al-Baqarah 2:187] 
“They ask you concerning menstruation. Say: that is an Adha (a harmful thing for a husband to have a sexual intercourse with his wife while she is having her menses), therefore, keep away from women during menses and go not unto them till they are purified (from menses and have taken a bath). And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as Allah has ordained for you (go in unto them in any manner as long as it is in their vagina). Truly, Allah loves those who turn unto Him in repentance and loves those who purify themselves (by taking a bath and cleaning and washing thoroughly their private parts and bodies for their prayers)” [Al-Baqarah 2:222]

20847,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20847,Can a Woman Do Household Duties when She Is Junub?,"Is it permissible for a woman to do her usual household duties such as cooking, looking after the children, and housework, before she does Ghusl following intercourse?","There is nothing wrong with a woman who is Junub cooking, looking after her house, taking care of her children or fulfilling any other needs.","Is it permissible for a woman to do housework when she is Junub?


The recommendation to hasten to do Ghusl after intercourse","Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible for a woman to do housework when she is Junub?
It is prohibited for the person who is Junub (in a state of impurity following sexual activity) to pray, perform Tawaf, stay in the mosque, recite Quran or touch the Mus-haf. Everything else is permissible. 
There is nothing wrong with a woman who is Junub cooking, looking after her house , taking care of her children or fulfilling any other needs. This is indicated by several pieces of evidence including the following: 

It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) met him on one of the roads of Madinah when he was Junub. He said: I turned back and went and did Ghusl , then I came. He said: “Where were you, O Abu Hurayrah?” I said: “I was Junub and I did not like to sit with you when I was not in a state of purity.” He said, “Subhan Allah, the Muslim does not become impure.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 279 and Muslim, 371) 

Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “This indicates that it is permissible to delay doing Ghusl from the time when it first becomes obligatory, and that it is permissible for the one who is Junub to go about his business.” (Fat-h Al-Bari, 1/391) 
The recommendation to hasten to do Ghusl after intercourse 
It is better for the one who is Junub to hasten to do Ghusl, lest he forgets that he is Junub. And it is recommended for him to do Wudu before he touches food and drink and before going to sleep. That is better than doing these things when he is Junub. But this Wudu is not obligatory, rather it serves to reduce the impurity, and it is recommended. There are a number of Hadiths concerning that, including the following: 

It was narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was Junub and wanted to eat or sleep, he would do Wudu as for prayer. (Narrated by Muslim, 305)
It was narrated from Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Can one of us go to sleep when he is Junub?” He said: “Yes, if he does Wudu then he can go to sleep when he is Junub.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 283 and Muslim, 306)

An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“This indicates that it is recommended to do Wudu and to wash one's private parts before doing all these things, especially if the man wants to have intercourse with a wife with whom he has not yet had intercourse. It is definitely recommended to wash one's private parts. Our companions have stated that it is disliked to sleep, eat, drink or have intercourse before doing Wudu, and these Hadiths indicate that. There is no dispute among us that this Wudu is not obligatory. This is also the view of Malik and the majority.” (Sharh Muslim, 3/217)
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:  
“It is recommended for the one who is Junub to do Wudu if he wants to eat, drink, sleep or have intercourse again, but it is disliked for him to sleep if he has not done Wudu. It was proven in an authentic narration that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked, “Can one of us go to sleep when he is Junub?” He said: “Yes, if he does Wudu as for prayer…”  (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 21/343)

A man has had a relationship with a woman bearing 2 children during their marriage relationship way back on their own country. In the course of time, the man got a job in Saudi Arabia for contractual basis, leaving his wife and children behind. At the time the man was working in Saudi Arabia, he met a woman and had a relationship with her which bores them 1 child. A civil marriage ceremony was consumated without the knowledge of the first wife which he leave in his own country.  
Now, the couple who both works in Saudi Arabia recently embraced Islam. Since both are new in the religion, fearing they might commit sins/wrongs which is against the teaching of Islam, could you please give us your advise on the following:  
1. what is the Islamic ruling about the relationship mentioned?  
2. what is the man's responsibility as far as to his 2 children from the first wife, and what is his responsibility now to the first wife?  
3. what sins are committed and what to do to avoid this sins?   Further, please give Islmaic advice as regards the siutation stated above.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
We praise Allaah for having guided them to Islam, and we ask Allaah to make them steadfast in Islam until death, so that they may attain the Paradise of Allaah and His good pleasure. We give them the glad tidings that Islam erases whatever sin came before it. No matter what sins a person may have committed, if Allaah then blesses him with guidance to Islam, then he will become cleansed and free from sin as on the day his mother bore him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say to those who have disbelieved, if they cease (from disbelief), their past will be forgiven”
[al-Anfaal 8:38]
“If they cease” means if they give up their kufr or disbelief by submitting to Allaah alone, with no partner or associate. Tafseer al-Sa’di. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Islam erases whatever came before it” (narrated by Muslim, 121) – meaning, of sin. 
Secondly: 
A man does not have the right to form a relationship with a woman who is a stranger (non-mahram) to him. If something of that nature happened before they got married, it is a sin which is recorded against them. If that happened before they became Muslim, then Allaah has forgiven it when they became Muslim. 
If that happened after they became Muslim, then they have to repent from that. Allaah has promised to accept the repentance of the one who turns to Him in repentance. He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and forgives sins, and He knows what you do”
[al-Shoora 42:25]
“But indeed, I am the Perpetual Forgiver of whoever repents and believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance.”
[Ta-Ha 20:82]
For more information on repentance and its conditions, please see question no. 13990. 
Thirdly: 
There is no sin involved in a man’s marrying a second wife. Allaah has permitted a man to have up to four wives, if he is able to treat them fairly and give them all their rights. He does not have to inform his first wife of his desire to marry a second or that he has already done so. 
Fourthly: 
With regard to the man's duties towards his children and first wife, he has to spend on them according to their needs. What really matters is that he should try to guide them and save them from the Fire, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allaah, but do that which they are commanded”
[al-Tahreem 66:6]
So he must do all that he can to call his wife to Islam and to advise her, and encourage her to embrace Islam. If she refuses then he can still remain married to her and not divorce her if she is from among the People of the Book (i.e., Jewish or Christian). But if she is an idol-worshipper then it is not permissible for her to remain the wife of a Muslim, so in that case he has to divorce her. 
Please see also question no. 9949. 
It should be noted that if one of the parents becomes Muslim and his children are still small (i.e., below the age of adolescence), then they are judged to be Muslim because of his becoming Muslim. But if they are adults or have reached the age of adolescence, then that is not the case. See al-Mughni, 13/115; Ahkaam Ahl al-Dhimmah by Ibn al-Qayyim, 2/507. 
Based on this, if the small children know that Allaah has blessed him and them with guidance to the true religion, then he has to teach them about tahaarah (purity, i.e., wudoo’) and prayer, and other rulings, so that they will grow up with it and get used to doing it, following the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Teach your children to pray when they are seven years old and smack them if they do not do it when they are ten, and separate them in their beds.”

He should not stay here for work and leave his young children exposed to loss and deviation; he should try to bring them here to be with him, so that he will be able to do that which Allaah has enjoined him to do of bringing them up well. If he cannot bring them here then he should be in constant contact with them, corresponding with them and guiding them. It is not permissible for him to neglect them and leave them to be lost. He will be responsible for them on the Day of Resurrection.  
We also encourage our new brother and his wife to learn the rulings of Islam by reading and asking knowledgeable people and reading useful Islamic sites on the internet, and to apply whatever they have learned in the required manner. 
We ask Allaah to make them steadfast and help them to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.

But because wudu is an expiation for bad deeds, and sins are erased by it, you should try to avoid haram things after doing it, so that you may stand before Allah pure and clean. Muslim (244) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When the Muslim or believing slave does wudu and washes his face, every wrong thing that he looked at with his eyes comes out from his face with the water or with the last drop of water. When he washes his hands, every wrong thing that he did with his hands comes out from his hands with the water or with the last drop of water.

He would use the tooth stick, do wudu’ and pray nine Rak’ahs, in which he would not sit except in the eighth, when he would remember Allah, glorify Him and make Du`a’.  Then he would get up without saying Salam, and pray the ninth Rak`ah. Then he would sit down and again remember Allah, glorify Him and make Du`a’. Then he would say a Salam that we could hear, then he would pray two Rak`ahs after that, whilst sitting down.” Narrated by Muslim; this is part of a lengthy Hadith, which is to be understood as meaning that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed two Rak`ahs after Witr to show that it is permissible to pray after Witr.”

Does they who worked to family and living with that family is considering as a slave ?  

It is very important to us know about The status about Woman Labour, because this issue used by christian misionaries to denigrating Islam in here. 

Please attached Fatwa from some Ulama Institution/authorithies..",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    The servants who work in households do not come under the 
    same rulings as slaves, whether male or female. Rather they come under the 
    ruling of private workers who are hired to work for the employer, and are 
    like any other employee. 

    We have already spoken about female servants and the ruling 
    on bringing them from their countries, and the haraam actions committed by 
    some families towards female servants. Please see the answer to question no.
    26282. 

    Secondly: 

    What some of these heads of households have done to these 
    servants is not condoned by Islam, rather Islam forbids it and warns against 
    it. It is not permissible to use that as a means of attacking Islam or 
    giving a bad impression of Islam, because these sins on the part of some 
    Muslims are forbidden by Islam itself. 

    Al-Bukhaari (50) and Muslim (1661) narrated that Abu Dharr 
    said: I cursed a man and slandered his mother, and the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to me: “O Abu Dharr, are you 
    slandering his mother? You are a man in whom there is still some jaahiliyyah 
    (ignorance)! Your slaves are your brothers whom Allaah has put under your 
    command. So whoever has a brother under his command should feed him of what 
    he eats and dress him of what he wears. Do not ask them (slaves) to do 
    things beyond their capacity and if you do so, then help them.” This is the 
    justice of Islam towards slaves who are owned by a person, so how should it 
    be with a servant who is not a slave who belongs to his or her employer, but 
    is rather hired to do a job? 

    Thirdly: 

    It is not permissible to be alone with these female servants, 
    or to look at them, because they are non-mahrams to the men of the 
    household. Similarly male servants are non-mahrams to the women of the 
    household so it is not permissible for them to uncover in front of them or 
    to be alone with them. 

    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    was asked: 

    What is the ruling on dealing with servants and drivers – do 
    they come under the same heading as non-mahram men? My mother tells me to go 
    out in front of the servants and to put a scarf on my head. Is that 
    permitted in our pure monotheistic religion which tells us not to disobey 
    the commands of Allaah? 

    He replied: 
Drivers and servants 
    come under the same rulings as all other men: it is obligatory to observe 
    hijab in front of them if they are not mahrams. It is not permitted to 
    uncover one's face in front of them or to be alone with any of them, because 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No man 
    is alone with a [non-mahram] woman but the third one present is the 
    Shaytaan.” And because of the general meaning of the evidence which 
    indicates that hijab is obligatory and that it is haraam to make a wanton 
    display of oneself or to uncover oneself in front of non-mahrams. It is not 
    permissible to obey your mother or anyone else in matters that involve 
    disobedience towards Allaah.

Reasons for lack of self-confidence


How parents boost daughter’s self-confidence


What causes a child to feel inadequate?","Praise be to Allah.When do daughters form their attitudes towards the world?
At the age of two, a child starts to form her attitude towards the world around her. Some developmental psychologists think that the sense of self-confidence is one of the first of these attitudes and the strength of these feelings at age 2 depends on the kind of care that the child receives and on the parents’ attitude in meeting her basic needs. 
At this stage, the child shows signs of development by showing a desire for independence, as she needs the freedom to speak, walk and play. All of that is connected to the need to assert herself which can only be achieved by allowing her a measure of independence. 
This is confirmed by the theory of development through maturity which says that we should respect the child’s individuality and leave him or her to develop naturally. 
Reasons for lack of self-confidence
Some girls grow up lacking self-confidence such that they cannot rely upon themselves in any matter, major or minor. They rarely take any initiative and are always waiting for someone to say, “Do such and such.”
If faced with a problem, such a girl will be unable to take any decision and may try to avoid confronting the problem, or start crying. This is partly the parents’ fault, and it may be for a number of reasons, such as:

Too much control (“Do this, don’t do that”) in major and minor matters alike, even if the matter does not warrant it, so that the child loses her spontaneity and this makes her lose confidence in her actions, and instead she always waits for someone to correct her and reassure her that she is doing the right thing.
Blaming and criticizing her for everything she does, exposing her faults and rebuking her if she makes a mistake, so that she is blamed and rebuked more than she deserves at the time when she is expecting praise for her efforts. This destroys the child’s motivation to act or to compete in doing anything and doing it well.
Not giving the child the opportunity to speak in front of others for fear that she may make a mistake or speak of things that are not desirable, or else allowing her to speak but telling her what she should say.
Giving her too many warnings about danger, which will make her always expect the worst and imagine that she is surrounded by danger on all sides.
Putting her down or comparing her to others, which makes her think that she has no worth.
Making fun of her and mocking her.
Not paying attention to her questions.
Paying too much attention in a manner that shows excessive worry about her health or her future.

Negative effects of lack of self-confidence
Lack of self-confidence has many negative effects on the child, such as:

She will not be able to do anything independently, and if she is asked to bring something and finds that it differs from the description given, she will be hesitant; if she is faced with a problem she will be unable to make a decision.
She will become dull-witted and not creative.
She will start to complain and feel unhappy whenever anything is asked of her, because she thinks that she will be blamed for whatever she does and that she will not be able to do it in the manner required.
She will become weak-willed and will have no resolve, and she will feel meek and apathetic in situations where such attitudes are not appropriate, and will become neglectful and disorganized.
She will suffer anxiety and frustration, and will develop a hostile attitude or a tendency to become introverted and withdrawn.

How parents boost daughter’s self-confidence
In order to avoid these negative effects on the child, parents should use a number of ways to develop the child’s self-confidence. Some examples follow, but this is not a complete list:

They should draw up some general guidelines to follow by telling her what Allah has made permissible, which she may do, and what He has forbidden, which she must avoid. They should make her aware of noble attributes and good manners, and instill in her a dislike for bad manners, deeds and words, and the need to steer clear of trivial matters. Then after that they should give her the freedom to act on her own initiative.
The mother should assign her some tasks that she is able to do. If she makes a mistake, the mother should praise her for her initiative and encourage her, then tell her what she should have done. Sometimes she should just praise her for her efforts, then complete the work in a gentle manner, without telling her directly. If the task is not something that the child is able to do, then the mother may do it and consult the child and ask for her opinion, and let the child state what she thinks is good and is not, so that the child will realize that everyone is vulnerable to making mistakes but also gets things right sometimes. This will strengthen her resolve.
The parents should try to praise the child in front of her relatives and friends, and give her rewards commensurate with her efforts. They should praise her for the acts of worship that she does, such as praying regularly, memorizing Quran, doing well in her studies, having a good attitude, and so on.
They should give her a nickname that will distinguish her from others, but they should not allow anyone to call her by a bad nickname. If she makes them angry they should call her by her real name, so that she will realize that she has fallen short in her duty to one or both of them, or that she has wronged somebody, so that she will realize that.
Strengthening her will-power, by getting her used to two things, namely:


Keeping secrets: when she knows how to keep secrets and not divulge them, then her will-power will develop and grow stronger, and thus her self-confidence will increase.
Getting her used to fasting, for when she stands firm in the face of hunger and thirst when fasting, she will feel the joy of achieving victory over her Nafs (self), which will strengthen her will-power when facing life, and in turn, this will increase her self-confidence.


Strengthening her confidence in dealing with other people. This may be done by getting her to do housework, obeying the parents’ commands, and letting her sit with the adults and get together with other youngsters.
Strengthening her confidence in gaining knowledge, by teaching her the Quran and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and his biography, so that she will grow up having acquired abundant knowledge in childhood, and thus develop a sense of confidence in the knowledge that she has, because she will have gained the basic principles of true knowledge, far removed from myths and legends.

What causes a child to feel inadequate?
Parents must take some precautions and take effective measures to save the child from feeling inadequate. Some of the things that cause a child to feel inadequate are: belittling her, humiliating her and mocking her, such as calling her by offensive names and words in front of her siblings and relatives, or even in front of her friends or in front of strangers whom she has never met before. 
These are matters which may make her regard herself as insignificant and worthless, or may generate psychological complexes that will make her look at others with hatred and dislike, and make her withdraw into herself in order to escape from life.
Even if the offensive words that slip from the parents’ tongues are only for the purpose of disciplining the child for some mistake, great or small, it is not right to use this method to correct her, as this will have a bad effect on the child’s psyche and personal conduct, and it will make her accustomed to the language of condemnation and insult that will destroy her psychologically and morally.
The best way of dealing with this problem is to explain to the child, in a gentle manner, where she has gone wrong and to give her proof that will convince her to avoid the mistake in future; the parents should not scold her, and certainly not in front of others. The parents should use good methods in correcting her from the outset, following the example of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the way he reformed and trained people and corrected their mistakes. For the child is very sensitive and readily influenced, irrational and helpless. Building the child’s self-confidence is the first step in building her personality through all stages of life.

I am in the process of clearing it up now. However, I also had previously invested in a few Banking stocks (unaware that it was wrong), which have depreciated in value. can I set off my loss in the banking stocks with the interest on my savings account??.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The one who has repented from riba should not take anything but the capital of his wealth only, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but if you repent, you shall have your capital sums. Deal not unjustly (by asking more than your capital sums), and you shall not be dealt with unjustly (by receiving less than your capital sums)”
[al-Baqarah 2:279]
It is not permissible to take anything more than that; if a person has taken it he must get rid of it by spending it on charitable causes. 
In the question there are two issues which have nothing to do with one another, and we must deal with them separately: the interest which has been taken, and offsetting the depreciation in the value of shares with this interest.  
With regard to the first issue: putting money in a riba-based bank and taking more money than the original capital. The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 
The interest which the bank pays to depositors on the money that they deposit is considered to be riba (usury, interest), and it is not permissible to make use of this money. The person must repent to Allaah from depositing money in riba-based banks, he should withdraw the money that he deposited and the interest, then keep his original amount and spend the interest in charitable causes, such as on the poor and needy, renovating public facilities, and so on. 
Fataawa Islamiyyah, 2/404. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
With regard to the interest that the bank gives you, do not give it back to the bank and do not consume it, rather spend it on charitable causes such as giving it to the poor, renovating public washrooms, and helping debtors who are unable to pay off their debts. 
Fataawa Islamiyyah, 2/407 
With regard to the second issue: offsetting the depreciation in the value of shares with this interest, it is not permissible to do this, because it is not permissible for you to take this money and benefit from it, as stated above. 
The person who buys shares has to bear losses in the value of his shares from his own money; he does not have the right to offset those losses with money that he acquires from haraam sources. 
The fact that he entered into this transaction when he was unaware of the fact that it is haraam means that he is absolved of any sin; he is excused by the fact that he did not know. But that is not a reason for allowing him to benefit from the interest by using it to offset these losses.

20880,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20880,Is the story that the astronaut Neil Armstrong became Muslim true?,"I'm interested regarding NIL AMSTRONG.we know he had embraced islam.is he alive ? if so, pls reply about him.

Some of my friends don't belive regarding his embracing islam.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The story about Neil Armstrong, who they say was the first 
    man to step onto the surface of the moon, becoming a Muslim is one of the 
    stories that are passed around among people. We have researched this story 
    and we did not find any reliable source for it. 

    We have got used to hearing stories like that which then turn 
    out to false, and it seems that this is a deliberate attempt to shake the 
    faith of the ordinary Muslims, especially since they fabricated this story 
    with some exciting details, that seem to affirm the superiority of this 
    religion over all other religions. So they spread the news that famous 
    people, such as artists, sportsmen and others have become Muslim, and they 
    quote something with the story that affirms the truth of the Messenger and 
    his message, then after a while they hasten to disprove these stories. 
    Perhaps the story about Armstrong becoming a Muslim is of this type, because 
    he is one of the most famous people in the world. Moreover the reason why he 
    supposedly became Muslim – as they say – is that he heard the adhaan (call 
    to prayer) on the Moon then he heard it again in Egypt. 

    If the story of such a famous person becoming Muslim was 
    really true, you would see him calling people to Islam and you would see the 
    scholars and daa’iyahs and the Islamic media meeting him and talking to him, 
    none of which happened in this case. If you compare the story of Armstrong 
    supposedly becoming Muslim with the story of Yusuf Islam (the former Cat 
    Stevens, the famous British singer), you will see the difference between 
    lies and truth, imagination and reality. 

    Yusuf Islam is one of the most famous of those who have 
    really converted to Islam, so you see his picture in the Islamic media and 
    he has his schools in Britain, and he travels in the Muslim world and 
    performs Hajj and ‘Umrah. What has Neil Armstrong done of such things, even 
    though he is far more famous?  

    Whatever the case, we do not need to hear the adhaan on the 
    Moon in order to prove that our religion is true. If this man or anyone else 
    becomes Muslim, he is the one who will benefit from that, and if he goes 
    astray and disbelieves, then he is the one who will be harmed by that. 

    We remind you of the words of Allaah (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “Say: O you mankind! Now truth (i.e. the Qur’aan and 
    Prophet Muhammad), has come to you from your Lord. So whosoever receives 
    guidance, he does so for the good of his own self; and whosoever goes 
    astray, he does so to his own loss; and I am not (set) over you as a Wakeel 
    (disposer of affairs to oblige you for guidance)”

    [Yoonus 10:108] 

    “Verily, We have sent down to you (O Muhammad) the Book 
    (this Qur’aan) for mankind in truth. So whosoever accepts the guidance, it 
    is only for his ownself; and whosoever goes astray, he goes astray only for 
    his (own) loss. And you (O Muhammad) are not a Wakeel (trustee or disposer 
    of affairs, or guardian) over them”

    [al-Zumar 39:41]

    “You are to me as my mother’s back”) or for breaking one’s fast in Ramadaan 
    by having intercourse, instead of giving food, is not sufficient, even if 
    one thinks that money is more useful. Rather the person has to give food of 
    the type that he gives to his own family, whether it be wheat, dates, 
    barley, rice or whatever, because this expiation is an act of worship that 
    must be done in the manner enjoined by sharee’ah. There are many poor people 
    who will accept this food. The person who is obliged to offer expiation does 
    not have to distribute this food all at the same time, rather he may do it 
    in the way that is easiest for him. 

    From Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 23/8 

    If a person cannot find ten poor people, or it is difficult 
    for him to give the expiation himself, then some charities can give the 
    kafaarah on behalf of people and give it to those who are entitled to it. 

    So he could pay the equivalent amount to a trustworthy

20882,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20882,How should missed prayers be made up?,I would like to know how many rakats do u have to prey if the time of the prayer has gone past ( koza ). Some say u just prey the farz salat which i am doing at the moment when i don't have time to prey at the right time and the salat time has gone past.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
It is not permissible for a Muslim to delay the prayer until its time is over with no excuse. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, As‑Salaah (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours” [al-Nisa’ 4:103]
i.e., at specific times. 
Reasons why prayers may be delayed until their time is over include sleeping and forgetting. It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: The Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever forgets a prayer or sleeps and misses it, its expiation is to make it up as soon as he remembers it.” Narrated by Muslim, 684. 
With regard to work, study, etc, these are not excuses that allow delaying a prayer until its time is over. Allah praises some people by saying (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Men whom neither trade nor sale (business) diverts from the remembrance of Allah (with heart and tongue) nor from performing As‑Salaah (Iqaamat‑as‑Salaah) nor from giving the Zakaah. They fear a Day when hearts and eyes will be overturned (out of the horror of the torment of the Day of Resurrection)” [al-Noor 24:37]
Secondly: 
Whoever neglects to pray until the time for that prayer is over, with no excuse, has committed a sin which is one of the major sins. He has to repent to Allah and resolve to offer that prayer regularly on time. Making it up after its time is over will not avail him anything when he has missed it with no excuse. He should also do a lot of naafil (supererogatory) prayers, in the hope that they will make up the shortfall in his obligatory prayers. 
With regard to the one who delays a prayer until its time is over because of a (legitimate) excuse, such as sleeping or forgetting, he has to perform the prayer as soon as that excuse is no longer in effect, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever forgets a prayer let him offer it as soon as he remembers it , and there is no other expiation but that.” Narrated by Muslim. 
He should pray the number of rak’ahs he would have prayed if he had offered it on time, no more and no less, and without changing the way it is done. 
In the hadeeth of Abu Qataadah in Saheeh Muslim (681) there is the story of how the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions slept and missed Fajr prayer when on a journey, and (they did not wake up) until the sun had risen. Abu Qataadah said: “Then Bilaal gave the call to prayer, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed two rak’ahs, then he prayed Fajr, and he did the same as he did every day.” 
Al-Nawawi said: “The same as he used to do every day” indicates that the way in which missed prayers are to be made up is the same way as they would normally be done. 
The basic principle according to the scholars is that making up is identical to the original action.

Can a Muslim Man Marry a Non-Muslim Woman?","Praise be to Allah.Belief in Allah: Your key to real happiness
Through this website we will send a message to this non-Muslim woman and others, telling them that no one can attain true life, happiness and peace of mind unless he believes in Allah as his Lord , Islam as his religion and Muhammad as his Prophet. 
For all of the universe is created, and its Creator is Allah. He is the One Who raised the heavens with no pillars and spread out the earth, and created the mountains to stabilize it, and created the sea and the rivers. 
{Surely, His is the creation and commandment. Blessed is Allah, the Lord of the `Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists)!} [Al-A’raf 7:54 – interpretation of the meaning]
Once this is clear, it should be understood that Allah sent messengers to His slaves, to show them the way, teach them and guide them to the path of salvation. 
{Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the (coming of) Messengers.} [An-Nisa’ 4:165]
And He ended the series of His messengers with Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): 
{Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the last (end) of the Prophets.} [Al-Ahzab 33:40 – interpretation of the meaning]
Allah sent him with the religion of Islam other than which He will not accept any religion from anyone: 
{And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.} [Al `Imran 3:85 – interpretation of the meaning]
How to convert to Islam
With regard to when and how she may become Muslim , it is very easy indeed. All she has to do is to say “Ashhadu an la ilaha illa Allah wa ashhadu anna Muhammad ‘abduhu was rasuluhu (I bear witness that there is no god except Allah and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger).” Once she says that, she becomes Muslim . She should hasten to do that, because death may come suddenly, and no one knows whether he will live until tomorrow or not. 
We welcome her as our sister in Islam, and we ask Allah to inspire her and guide her to do that which will bring her happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. 
Can a Muslim Man Marry a Non-Muslim Woman?
What is stated in this question is that the woman is “non-Muslim”. This may be understood as meaning that she is one of the people of the Book – i.e., Jewish or Christian – or it may be understood as meaning that she is something else – such as Buddhist, Zoroastrian or communist. 
If the woman who wants to marry a Muslim man is one of the people of the Book, there is no Shar’i impediment to this marriage, so long as it fulfils the shar’i conditions, such as the requirement that she be chaste. But the Muslim husband should be keen to bring his wife into Islam so as to save her from eternity in the Fire and so that he and his children will have a home that is based on Islam. 
But if the woman who wants to marry a Muslim man is not one of the people of the Book, then it is not permissible for a Muslim to marry her. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
{And do not marry Al-Mushrikat (idolatresses) till they believe (worship Allah Alone). And indeed a slave woman who believes is better than a (free) Mushrikah (idolatress), even though she pleases you. And give not (your daughters) in marriage to Al-Mushrikun till they believe (in Allah Alone) and verily, a believing slave is better than a (free) Mushrik (idolater), even though he pleases you. Those (Al-Mushrikun) invite you to the Fire, but Allah invites (you) to Paradise and forgiveness by His Leave, and makes His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) clear to mankind that they may remember.} [Al-Baqarah 2:221]
Ibn Kathir said: 
“Here Allah forbids the believers to marry a mushrik woman who worships idols, and if this were general in meaning, it would include every mushrik woman, whether she is of the people of the Book or is an idol worshipper, but the women of the people of the Book are excluded from that in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
{(Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time when you have given their due Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage), desiring chastity (i.e. taking them in legal wedlock) not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends} [Al-Ma'idah 5:5]
‘Ali ibn Abi Talhah said, narrating from Ibn ‘Abbas concerning the words {And do not marry Al-Mushrikat (idolatresses) till they believe (worship Allah Alone)}: Allah excludes from that the women of the people of the Book. This was also the view of Mujahid, ‘Ikrimah, Sa`id ibn Jubayr, Makhul, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhauak, Zayd ibn Aslam, Ar-Rabi` ibn Anas and others. And it was said that what is meant is the mushrikun who worship idols, and it does not mean the people of the Book at all. This meaning is close to the first meaning. And Allah knows best.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 1/474)
While noting that this is permissible, we should also remember that Islam encourages the Muslim man to marry a Muslim woman who is religiously committed, because the Muslim’s life with his wife is a complete and comprehensive life which involves chastity, lowering the gaze, and protecting and looking after the house and children. These and similar things cannot be achieved except with a religiously-committed wife.

    the case of the Jahamis, Raafidis and those who believe in hulool (incarnation) and ittihad (unity of the Creator and creation), in which case 
    their prayer is not valid and it is not permissible for anyone to pray behind them; 
Or the bid’ah may not amount to kufr, such as 
    speaking the intention (niyyah) out loud, and gathering to recite dhikr together as the Sufis do. The prayer of these people is valid, as are 
    prayers offered behind them. But the Muslim has to advise them to give up this bid’ah. If they pay heed, then this is what is wanted, otherwise 
    the person has done what he was obliged to do. In this case it is better to look for another imam who is keen to follow the Sunnah. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him0 said: 
The kind of bid’ah for which a person is 
    regarded as being one of those who follow their whims and desires is that which is well known among the scholars of the Sunnah for going against 
    the Qur’aan and Sunnah, such as the bid’ah of the Khaarijis, the Raafidis, the Qadaris and the Murji’is. ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Mubaarak, Yoosuf ibn 
    Asbaat and others said: The roots of the seventy-two sects are four: the Khaarijis, the Raafidis, the Qadaris and the Murji’is. It was said to Ibn 
    al-Mubaarak, And the Jahamis? He said, The Jahamis are not part of the ummah of Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
The Jahamis deny the divine attributes and 
    say that the Qur’aan was created, that Allaah will not be seen in the Hereafter, that Muhammad was not taken up to Allaah [on the night of the 
    Mi’raaj], and that Allaah has no knowledge, power or life, and so on, as the Mu’tazilis, philosophers and their followers said. ‘Abd al-Rahmaan 
    ibn Mahdi said: There are only two groups to beware of: the Jahamis and the Raafidis. 
These two groups are the worst of the 
    followers of innovation, and from them stemmed the esoteric Qaraamiti groups such as the Nusayris and Ismaa’ilis. Similar to them are those who 
    believe in the unity of the Creator and the creation, because their ideas are akin to Pharaonic 
    ideas.                                                                  
The Raafidis of the current age, as well as 
    being Raafidis are also Jahamis and Qadaris, because in addition to their rafd [which has to do with their beliefs concerning the imams] they also 
    follow the Mu’tazili school of thought, and some of them even follow the school of thought of the Ismaa’ilis and other similar heretics and those 
    who believe in the unity of the Creator and the creation. And Allaah and His Messenger know best. 
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 
    35/414-415. 
The Scholars of the Standing Committee said: 
With regard to praying behind an innovator, 
    if his bid’ah amounts to shirk, such as calling upon someone other than Allaah, making vows to someone other than Allaah, or believing that their 
    shaykhs possess attributes that belong to Allaah alone – such as perfect knowledge, knowledge of the unseen or the power to influence events – 
    then prayers offered behind them are not valid. If their bid’ah does not amount to shirk, such as reciting dhikrs that were narrated from the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but doing that in unison and swaying from side to side, then prayers offered behind them 
    are valid, but the Muslim should look for an imam to pray behind who is not a follower of innovation, because that will increase his reward and is 
    farther removed from evil.

Undoubtedly exchanging visits and getting together with brothers, cousins and relatives on the ‘Eids that are prescribed in Islam (namely ‘Eid al-Fitr and ‘Eid al-Adha), and on happy occasions, is something that brings happiness and increases love and strengthens the bonds between relatives. 
But what happens in many of these family gatherings, such as mixing between (non-mahram) men and women, even if they are relatives and cousins, are bad customs that go against the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah, which enjoin lowering the gaze and forbid wanton display, being alone with a member of the opposite sex (khalwah), shaking hands with non-mahram women, and all the things that lead to fitnah. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned against the dangers of taking matters lightly with relatives. He said: “Beware of entering upon women.” A man from among the Ansar said: “O Messenger of Allah, what do you think about the in-law?” He said: “The in-law is death.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4934; Muslim, 2172.)

This is a recently invented kind of celebration, but it is okay so long as they do not make this day like an ‘Eid which they celebrate every year.

20894,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20894,Obligation to destroy idols,"Is it obligatory to destroy statues in Islam, even if they are part of the legacy of human civilization? Why is it that when the Sahaabah conquered other lands and saw statues there they did not destroy them?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The evidence of sharee’ah indicates that it is obligatory to destroy idols, for example: 
1 – Muslim (969) narrated that Abu’l-Hayaaj al-Asadi said: ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib said to me: “Shall I not send you with the same instructions as the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent me? ‘Do not leave any image without defacing it or any built-up grave without leveling it.’” 
2 – Muslim (832) narrated from ‘Urwah ibn ‘Abasah that he said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “With what were you sent?” He said, “I was sent to uphold the ties of kinship, to break the idols, and so that Allaah would be worshipped alone with no partner or associate.” 
The obligation to destroy them is even stronger if they are worshipped instead of Allaah. 
3 – al-Bukhaari (3020) and Muslim (2476) narrated that Jareer ibn ‘Abd-Allaah al-Bajali said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to me: “O Jareer, will you not relieve me of Dhu’l-Khalsah?”  That was a house (in Yemen) belonging to the (tribe of) Khath’am, which was called Ka’bat al-Yamaaniyyah. I set out with one hundred and fifty horsemen. I used not to sit firm on horses and I mentioned that to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He struck me on my chest with his hand and said, 'O Allaah! Make him firm and make him one who guides others and is guided on the right path.' "" So Jareer went and burned it with fire, then Jareer sent a man called Abu Artaat to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He said, “I did not come to you until we had left it like a scabby camel.” Then the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) blessed the horses of (the tribe of) Ahmas and their men five times. 
Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: 
This hadeeth indicates that it is prescribed to remove things that may tempt or confuse the people, whether they are buildings, people, animals or inanimate objects. 
4 – The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent Khaalid ibn al-Waleed (may Allaah be pleased with him) on a campaign to destroy al-‘Uzza. 
5 – and he sent Sa’d ibn Zayd al-Ashhali (may Allaah be pleased with him) on a campaign to destroy Manaat. 
6 – And he sent ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas (may Allaah be pleased with him) on a campaign to destroy Suwaa’. All of that happened after the Conquest of Makkah. 
Al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah, 4/712. 776. 5/83; al-Seerah al-Nabawiyyah by Dr. ‘Ali al-Salaabi, 2/1186.
Al-Nawawi said in Sharh Muslim when discussing the issue of image-making: 
They were unanimously agreed that whatever casts a shadow is not allowed and must be changed. 
Images that cast a shadow are three-dimensional images like these statues. 
With regard to what is said about the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) not destroying idols in the conquered lands, this is merely conjecture. The companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would not have left idols and statues alone, especially since they were worshipped at that time. 
If it is asked, how come the Sahaabah left alone the ancient idols of the Pharaohs and Phoenicians? The answer is that these idols fall into one of three categories: 
1 – These idols may have been in remote places that the Sahaabah did not reach; when the Sahaabah conquered Egypt, for example, that does not mean that they reached every part of the land. 
2 – These idols may not have been visible, rather they may have been inside Pharaonic buildings etc. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us to hasten when passing through the abodes of the wrongdoers and those who had been punished, and he forbade entering such places. In al-Saheehayn it is says: “Do not enter upon those who have been punished unless you are weeping, lest there befall you something like that which befall them.” He (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that when he passed by ashaab al-hijr [the dwellers of the rocky tract – see al-Hijr 15:80], in the land of Thamood, the people of Saalih (peace be upon him). 
According to another report narrated in al-Saheehayn, “If you are not weeping, then do not enter upon them, lest there befall you something like that which befall them.”  
What we think is that if the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw a temple or building belonging of these people, they did not enter it or even look at what was inside it.  
This will dispel any confusion about why the Sahaabah did not see the Pyramids or what is inside them. There is also the possibility that their doors and entrances were covered with sand at that time. 
3 – Many of these idols that are visible nowadays were covered and hidden, and have only been discovered recently, or they have been brought from remote places that the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not reach. 
Al-Zarkali was asked about the Pyramids and the Sphinx etc: Did the Sahaabah who entered Egypt see them? 
He said: They were mostly covered with sand, especially the Sphinx. 
Shibh Jazeerat al-‘Arab, 4/1188 
Then even if we assume that there was a statue that was visible and not hidden, then we still have to prove that the Sahaabah saw it and were able to destroy it. 
The fact of the matter is that the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) would not have been able to destroy some of these statues. It took twenty days to destroy some of these statues even with tools, equipment, and explosives etc that were not available to the Sahaabah at all. 
This is indicated by what Ibn Khuldoon said in al-Muqaddimah (p. 383), that the caliph al-Rasheed was unable to destroy the estrade of Chosroes. He started to do that, and he gathered men and tools, and burned it with fire, and poured vinegar on it, but he was unable to do it. And the caliph al-Ma’moon wanted to destroy the Pyramids in Egypt and he gathered workers but he could not do it. 
With regard to the excuse that these statues are part of the legacy of mankind, no attention should be paid to such words. Al-Laat, al-‘Uzaa, Hubal, Manaat and other idols were also a legacy for those who worshipped them among Quraysh and the Arabs. 
This is a legacy, but it is a haraam legacy which should be uprooted. When the command comes from Allaah and His Messenger, then the believer must hasten to obey, and the command of Allaah and His Messenger cannot be rejected on the grounds of this flimsy excuse. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The only saying of the faithful believers, when they are called to Allaah (His Words, the Qur’aan) and His Messenger, to judge between them, is that they say: “We hear and we obey.” And such are the successful (who will live forever in Paradise)”
[al-Noor 24:51]
We ask Allaah to help the Muslims to do that which He loves and which pleased Him.

20897,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20897,Soundness of the Narration About Fifteen Punishments for One Who Neglects Prayer,"My question is regarding these hadiths I was given in an email.
I just want to know if they are authentic before I pass them on. Jazakallahu khayran.
Hadith of Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)
The one who disdains the prayers will receive fifteen punishments from Allah. Six punishments in this lifetime, three while dying , three in the grave and three on the Day of Judgement.
The six punishments in this life:
1. Allah takes away blessings from his age (makes his life misfortunate)
2.Allah does not accept his plea (du'a)
3.Allah erases the features of good people from his face.
4.He will be detested by all creatures on earth.
5.Allah does not reward him for his good deeds (no thawab)
6.He will not be included in the du'a (supplications) of good people.
The three punishments while dying:
1. He dies humiliated.
2. He dies hungry.
3. He dies thirsty. Even if he drinks the water of all the seas he will still be thirsty.
The three punishments in the grave:
1. Allah tightens his grave until his chest ribs come over each other.
2. Allah pours on him fire with embers.
3. Allah sets on him a snake called ""the brave"", ""the bold"" which hits him from morning until afternoon for leaving the Fajr (early morning) prayer, from the afternoon until Asr (late afternoon) for leaving the Dhuhr (noon) prayer and so on. With each strike he sinks 70 yards under the ground.
The three punishments on the day of judgement:
1. Allah sends who would accompany him to hell pulling him on the face.
2. Allah gives him an angry look that makes the flesh of his face fall down.
3. Allah judges him strictly and orders him to be thrown in hell.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly:
The hadeeth, “Whoever neglects prayer, Allah will send fifteen punishments upon him, six in this world, three when he is dying, three in the grave and three when he emerges from the grave…” is a fabricated (mawdoo’) hadeeth which is falsely attributed to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
Concerning this hadeeth, Sh. Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said, in the magazine al-Buhooth al-Islamiyyah (22/329): With regard to the hadeeth which the author of this pamphlet attributes to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning the punishment of the one who does not pray, and which says that fifteen punishments will be sent upon him, etc., this is one of the fabricated ahadeeth (reports) that are falsely attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as was stated by the scholars (may Allah have mercy on him) such as al-Hafiz al-Dhahabi in Lisan al-Meezan, and al-Hafiz ibn Hajar and others. 
Similarly the Standing Committee issued a fatwa, no. 8689, declaring this hadeeth to be false, as it says in Fatawa al-Lajnah, 4/468. Among the things mentioned in this fatwa which it is worth quoting here are: 
What has been narrated from Allah and from His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning the punishment of the one who does not pray is sufficient. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, as‑salah (the formal prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours.”
[al-Nisa 4:103] 
And Allah says of the people of Hell (interpretation of the meaning): 
“‘What has caused you to enter Hell?’
They will say: ‘We were not of those who used to offer the salah (prayers).’”
[al-Muddaththir 74:42-43]
And He mentioned among their attributes the fact that they did not pray.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The covenant that stands between us and them is prayer; whoever gives up prayer is a kafir (disbeliever).” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2621; al-Nasai, 431; Ibn Majah, 1079. Classed as saheeh (authentic) by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2113. And there are other verses and ahadeeth (narrations) which speak of giving up the prayer, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) described it as kufr (disbelief).
See also question no.  2182.
Al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This hadeeth is mawdoo’ (fabricated) and falsely attributed to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It is not permissible to propagate it unless it is accompanied by a statement that it is fabricated, so that the people will have a clear understanding about it.
Fatawa al-Shaykh published by the Daw’ah center in ‘Anayzah, 1/6
We ask Allah to make you steadfast in your keenness to call your brothers and advise them, but you have to make it clear to everyone who is keen to do good for the people and to warn them against evil that it must be done in accordance with that which is proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and that there is sufficient material in the saheeh reports that we have no need for the da’eef (weak) material.
We ask Allah to grant you success and to guide those whom you call and all the Muslims to follow the straight path.

20898,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20898,What is the length of time between menstrual periods?,"What is the minimum period of purity (tuhr)? My menstrual cycle is not regular. Sometimes I do not have a period for months, sometimes it comes on time. I did ghusl following my period ten days ago, and during this time there was some light yellow spotting from time to time, but after ten days it increased and became a new period, with cramps (period pains) and the usual colour of menstrual blood. I was told to do ghusl and pray because the minimum length of tuhr (purity following the previous period) is fifteen days. Please advise me, may Allaah reward you with good, because I stopped praying, thinking that this was a period.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    There is no set minimum limit for the period of purity 
    between two menstrual periods, rather when a woman sees the blood – i.e., 
    menstrual blood which is “black” (dark red), recognizable and has a distinct 
    odour – she should refrain from fasting and praying, on condition that the 
    total number of days of menstrual bleeding does not exceed half of the cycle 
    (i.e., fifteen days in the month). Yellowish and brownish discharge seen 
    after the period has ended are of no significance and they do not come under 
    the same rulings as menstruation.",Shaykh ‘Abd al-Kareem al-Khudayr
