11708,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11708,It is preferable for a woman to listen to the adhaan then pray after that,"If an Imam makes the adan after the TIME of salah, and I pray at the TIME of salah, is it best for me to WAIT? or should i pray at the TIME?",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          One of the conditions of prayer is that the time for 
          that prayer should have begun. Hence is it not correct to pray before 
          the time begins. The evidence for that is the aayah (interpretation 
          of the meaning): 
 
          “Verily, As-Salaah (the prayer) is enjoined 
          on the believers at fixed hours”[al-Nisaa’ 4:103]
 
          The adhaan is the signal that the time for the prayer has come, so if 
          the muezzin gives the call to prayer on time, then women should listen to the adhaan then pray after that. But if the muezzin delays giving the call, then they should pray so long as they are sure that the time has begun. It is permissible for women to delay the prayer from the beginning of the time.","See Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 1/330"
11722,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11722,What Is Meant by the Blessed Night in Surat Al-Dukhan?,"what is the importance of 15 shaban,is it the night in which the fate of every one is decided for the next year?
 
the especial night mentioned in surah Dakan means which night.is it the shaban or Qadar?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Laylat al-Nusf min Sha’baan (the 15th of Sha’baan) is like any other night, and there is no sound report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to indicate that on this night the fate or destiny of people is decided.
See Question no. 8907 .
With regard to the night mentioned in the verses:
“We sent it (this Quran) down on a blessed night. Verily, We are ever warning [mankind that Our Torment will reach those who disbelieve in Our Oneness of Lordship and in Our Oneness of worship].
Therein (that night) is decreed every matter of ordainments”[al-Dukhaan 44:3-4]
Ibn Jareer al-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: the commentators differed concerning that night, i.e., which night of the year it is. Some of them said that it is Laylat al-Qadr, and it was narrated from Qurtaadah that it is Laylat al-Qadr. Others said that it is the night of the 15th of Sha’baan. The correct view is the view of those who say that it is Laylat al-Qadr, because Allah has told us of that when He says, ‘Verily, We are ever warning’ [al-Dukhaan 44:3].”
(Tafseer al-Tabari, 11/221)
With regard to the phrase, “Therein (that night) is decreed every matter of ordainments”: Ibn Hajar said in his commentary on Saheeh al-Bukhaari: “What this means is that the decrees for the year are decided on that night, because Allah says: ‘Therein (that night) is decreed every matter of ordainments’. And al-Nawawi said: the scholars said that it is called Laylat al-Qadr because on this night the angels write down the decrees (aqdaar), because Allah says, ‘Therein (that night) is decreed every matter of ordainments’. This was also narrated by ‘Abd al-Razzaaq and other mufassireen with saheeh isnaads from Mujaahid, ‘Ikrimah, Qutaadah and others. Al-Toorbashti said that the word used in the Quran is qadr, whereas people think it is qadar (decree); the word qadr refers to the detailed manifestation of the decree.
Laylat al-Qadr brings great reward for the one who does good deeds and strives in worship on that night.
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, We have sent it (this Quran) down in the Night of Al‑Qadr (Decree). 
And what will make you know what the Night of Al‑Qadr (Decree) is?
The Night of Al‑Qadr (Decree) is better than a thousand months (i.e. worshipping Allah in that night is better than worshipping Him a thousand months, i.e. 83 years and 4 months).
Therein descend the angels and the Rooh [Jibreel (Gabriel)] by Allah’s Permission with all Decrees, 
(All that night), there is peace (and goodness from Allah to His believing slaves) until the appearance of dawn”[al-Qadr 97:1-5]
There are many ahaadeeth which speak of the virtue of that night, such as the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari from Abu Hurayrah, in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever spends Laylat al-Qadr in prayer out of faith and hoping for reward, all his previous sins will be forgiven, and whoever fasts Ramadan out of faith and hoping for reward, all his previous sins will be forgiven.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, al-Sawm, 1768).

11724,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11724,"He died and left behind a mother, a father and a wife with whom he had not consummated the marriage","If a husband dies and leaves behind a wife with whom he had not consummated the marriage, as well as a father, a mother, a brother and a sister, how should his estate be divided?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Firstly: 

    Spouses become entitled to inherit from one another by virtue 
    of the marriage contract. If either spouse dies before the marriage has been 
    consummated, the other is entitled to inheritance. 

    Al-Tirmidhi (1145) narrated from Ibn Mas’ood that he was 
    asked about a man who married a woman but he did not stipulate a dowry for 
    her and he did not consummate the marriage with her, then he died. Ibn 
    Mas’ood said:  She should be given a dowry like that of women who are 
    similar to her, no more and no less, and she has to observe the ‘iddah, and 
    she is entitled to the inheritance. Ma’qil ibn Sinaan al-Ashja’i stood up 
    and said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) passed a ruling concerning Birwa’ bint Waashiq, one of our 
    womenfolk, that was like the ruling you have passed. Ibn Mas’ood was happy 
    with this (news). Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Irwa’, 1939. 

    Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni: 
With regard to 
    inheritance between spouses, it makes no difference whether that is before 
    or after consummation of the marriage, because of the general meaning of the 
    verse, and because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) ruled that Birwa’ bint Waashiq be given the inheritance. Her husband 
    died before consummating the marriage with her, and he had not stipulated a 
    dowry for her. And because the marriage is valid and proven, and thus the 
    right of inheritance is given, just as it is after consummation. End quote. 
He also said: With regard 
    to the inheritance, there is no scholarly dispute concerning it, because 
    Allaah has allocated a share to each of the spouses, and the marriage 
    contract between the spouses in this case is valid and proven, and one may 
    inherit from the other because of it, because it comes under the general 
    meaning of the text. End quote. 

    Secondly: 

    With regard to the issue mentioned in the question, the 
    siblings do not inherit anything. The scholars are unanimously agreed that 
    siblings do not inherit if the father is present. 

    See: al-Mughni, 9/6 

    Thirdly: 

    If there are two or more siblings, the mother gets one-sixth, 
    whether the siblings inherit or not, and whether they are male or female. 
    The evidence for that is the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 

    “if the deceased left brothers or (sisters), the mother 
    has a sixth”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:11]
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen 
    said in Tasheel al-Faraa’id (p. 33): 
The mother inherits 
    one-sixth if the deceased has descendents who are entitled to inherit, or if 
    he has a number of brothers or sisters, because Allaah says (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 

    “For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the 
    deceased left children; if no children, and the parents are the (only) 
    heirs, the mother has a third; if the deceased left brothers or (sisters), 
    the mother has a sixth”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:11]

    It makes no difference if his siblings are male or female, or 
    both, whether they are full-siblings or half-siblings through the mother or 
    father, or whether they inherit or are prevented from inheriting by the 
    presence of the father, as is the apparent meaning of the verse, because 
    Allaah has allocated one-third to the mother if the father is present. Then 
    He says “if the deceased left brothers or (sisters), the mother has a 
    sixth”. The fa’ here (in the word fa in, translated here as “if”) 
    indicates that the second phrase is connected to the first and is based on 
    it. Siblings do not inherit if the father is present, but despite that the 
    mother is given one-sixth in this case. This is the view of the majority of 
    scholars. 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was of the view that they do not 
    decrease the share of the mother to one-sixth if they are denied inheritance 
    by the presence of the father. But this is contrary to the apparent meaning 
    of the verse. 

    And he said in Nayl al-Ma’aarib (2/62): 
This ruling is proven 
    with regard to a brother or sister, and it makes no difference whether the 
    brother or sister who is reducing the share of the mother to one-sixth 
    inherits himself (or herself) or is deprived of inheritance by the presence 
    of the father. 

    Fourthly: 

    Based on this, in the case asked about here, the inheritance 
    is to be divided as follows: 

    The wife gets one-quarter because her deceased husband has no 
    descendents who inherit from him. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “… their (your wives) 
    share is a fourth if you leave no child; but if you leave a child, they get 
    an eighth of that which you leave after payment of legacies that you may 
    have bequeathed or debts”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:12]
The mother takes 
    one-sixth because of the presence of a number of siblings. 

    The father gets the rest of the estate, because the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Give the shares of 
    inheritance to those to whom they belong, and whatever is left is for the 
    closest male.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6732; Muslim, 1615.  

    So the estate should be divided into twelve equal shares, 
    three of which should be given to the wife, two to the mother, and the 
    remaining seven to the father.

11725,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11725,The difference between a Messenger and a Prophet,"Reference to Holy Quran 33:40 
........; he was a messenger of God and the last prophet. 
- What is the difference between messenger and prophet?
-Why A messnger and not the LAST messenger?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The well-known difference between a Prophet and a Messenger is that a Messenger is one to whom a law is revealed and he is commanded to convey it, whilst a Prophet is one to whom a law is revealed but he is not commanded to convey it. But this distinction is not free of problems, because a Prophet is also commanded to call people, convey the Message and judge among the people. Hence Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: The correct view is that the Messenger is one who is sent to a disbelieving people, and the Prophet is one who is sent to a believing people with the sharee’ah of the Messenger who came before him, to teach them and judge between them, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, We did send down the Tawraat (Torah) [to Moosa (Moses)], therein was guidance and light, by which the Prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah’s Will, judged for the Jews” [Al-Maa’idah 5:44]
So the Prophets of the Children of Israel judged by the Tawraat which Allah had revealed to Moosa.
 With regard to the aayah,
“but he is the Messenger of Allah and the last (end) of the Prophets” [Al-Ahzaab 33:40]
and why it did not say the last of the Messengers – the end of the Message does not mean the end of Prophethood, but the end of Prophethood does mean the end of the Message. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There will be no Prophet after me,” and he did not say, there will be no Messenger after me. 
Thus we know that there is no Messenger and no Prophet after him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him); he was the last of the Prophets and of the Messengers, (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).",Islam Q&A - Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

 Question: If he does it inside his own house and not in front of people, will he still be counted as is committing sin openly?
 Answer: If he were to do it in his own room on his own, we would not say that this committing sin openly, but the fact that he is doing it in front of his children means that he is giving them a bad upbringing as well as committing sin openly.

However, when I brought it up to my father, he refused because he said he could not bear to see me a widow in this world.  I understand the consequences of marrying someone who may die in battle (from a worldy perspective:  i.e I will be living without a husband for months at a time, there is a great possiblity I may become a widow, etc), however, the reward is far greater than any worldy benefit.  

So, is it my obligation to listen to my father?  Does he have a valid islamic excuse to reject this suitor when I am more than willing to be the wife a Mujahid?  Please help.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Marriage is a noble, legitimate bond that is 
    encouraged by our religion in several places in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. One of the most important factors in this bond 
    is to make a good choice when selecting a husband or wife. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Women are married 
    for four things: for their wealth, their lineage, their beauty and their religious commitment. Choose the one who is religiously committed, may 
    your hand be rubbed with dust [i.e., may you prosper].” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4802; Muslim, 1466. 
And he said, addressing the guardians (walis) 
    of women: “If there comes to you with a proposal of marriage one with whose religious commitment and attitude you are pleased, then marry [your 
    daughter or female relative under your care] to him, for if you do not do that, there will be fitnah (tribulation) on earth and widespread 
    corruption.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1084; Ibn Maajah, 1967. Classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 1022. 
Moreover jihad is one of the greatest kinds 
    of good deeds, and it is the pinnacle of Islam. Those who fight in jihad are among the best of the slaves of Allaah, and are among His party of 
    the successful. The virtue of jihad and the mujaahideen would take too long to explain here. 
Secondly: 
Going for jihad does not mean that death is 
    certain. Allaah has created all beings and has decreed their provision and life spans. It is strange that a Muslim would think that going for 
    jihad in the battle field means that he will be killed there, and that if he does not go for jihad he will escape death. This is a mistaken 
    notion, because jihad does not hasten the hour of a man's death, and not going for jihad does not delay it. A person may spend his whole life in 
    jihad and not be killed in battle. One of the best examples of that is the great Sahaabi Khaalid ibn al-Waleed (may Allaah be pleased with him) 
    who spent most of his life in the battlefield, then he died in his bed, whilst thousands of people die every minute in their homes or places of 
    work or on the street. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if Allaah were to seize mankind for 
    their wrongdoing, He would not leave on it (the earth) a single moving (living) creature, but He postpones them for an appointed term and when 
    their term comes, neither can they delay nor can they advance it an hour (or a moment)”
[al-Nahl 16:61] 
“No person knows what he will earn 
    tomorrow, and no person knows in what land he will die. Verily, Allaah is All‑Knower, All‑Aware (of things)”
[Luqmaan 31:34]
Allaah tells us of those who think like this, 
    and He refutes them: 
“O you who believe! Be not like those who 
    disbelieve (hypocrites) and who say to their brethren when they travel through the earth or go out to fight: ‘If they had stayed with us, they 
    would not have died or been killed,’ so that Allaah may make it a cause of regret in their hearts. It is Allaah that gives life and causes death. 
    And Allaah is All‑Seer of what you do”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:156 – interpretation of the 
    meaning]
Ibn Katheer said:  
Allaah forbids His believing slaves to 
    imitate the kuffaar in their corrupt belief which is indicated by what they said concerning their brethren who died on journeys or in war, that if 
    they had not travelled or gone to war, what befell them would not have befallen them. Allaah says “O you who believe! Be not like those who 
    disbelieve (hypocrites) and who say to their brethren” i.e., of their brethren; “when they travel through the earth” i.e., for the 
    purpose of trading etc; “or go out to fight” i.e., on military campaigns; “If they had stayed with us” i.e., in our land; “they 
    would not have died or been killed” i.e., they would not have died on the road or been killed in battle. The words, “so that Allaah may 
    make it a cause of regret in their hearts” mean, He has created this belief in their hearts to increase their sense of grief for their people 
    who died or were slain. 
Then Allaah says, refuting them: 
“It is Allaah that gives life and causes 
    death” meaning, creation is in His hand, and to Him all things return. No one lives or dies except by His will and decree, and there can be no 
    increase or decrease in the life span of anyone except by His will and decree.  
Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 
    1/420. 
And he said: 
Just as caution does not change the will and 
    decree of Allaah, so too fleeing from jihad or avoiding it does not hasten or delay the appointed time of death. Rather life span is decided and 
    provision is allocated. And it cannot be increased or decreased, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“(They are) the ones who said about their 
    killed brethren while they themselves sat (at home): ‘If only they had listened to us, they would not have been killed.’ Say: ‘Avert death from 
    your ownselves, if you speak the truth’”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:168] 
“They say: ‘Our Lord! Why have you 
    ordained for us fighting? Would that you had granted us respite for a short period?’ Say: ‘Short is the enjoyment of this world. The Hereafter is 
    (far) better for him who fears Allaah, and you shall not be dealt with unjustly even equal to the Fateela (a scalish thread in the long slit of a 
    date stone).
Wheresoever you may be, death will 
    overtake you even if you are in fortresses built up strong and high!’”
[al-Nisa’ 4:77-78]
And we have narrated from the commander of 
    the army, the leader of the troops, the guardian of Islam, the sword of Allaah unsheathed against His enemies, Abu Sulaymaan Khaalid ibn al-Waleed 
    (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he said – when he was about to die – “I have seen such and such battles, and there is no part of my body 
    that has not been struck by arrows, stabbed or hit, but here I am about to die in my bed like a camel. May the eyes of cowards know no sleep” – 
    meaning that he was sad that he had not been killed in war, and was grieved that he was going to die in his bed. 
Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 
    1/300.  
Thirdly:  
From the above it is clear that what your 
    father says about not wanting to see you widowed in his lifetime is mistaken, because if Allaah has decreed that for you, it will happen even if 
    you marry someone who is not a mujaahid. His refusing this man because he is preparing himself for jihad is not an acceptable justification 
    according to sharee’ah. But if there are other reasons that have to do with his attitude and religious commitment, then the father can refuse this 
    marriage. 
Fourthly: 
Our advice to you is to obey your father. You 
    do not have the right to marry without the permission of your guardian. The wise sharee’ah regards the marriage of a woman without the permission 
    of her guardian as invalid. 

    (a)
    It was narrated that Abu Moosa said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no marriage 
    without a guardian.”
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1101; Abu Dawood, 
    2085; Ibn Maajah, 1881. Classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 1/318. 

    (b)
    It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allaah (S) said: “Any woman who gets married 
    without the consent of her guardian, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid,” but if the marriage has been 
    consummated then the mahr belongs to her because she has allowed him to be intimate with her. And if she has no guardian then the ruler is the 
    guardian of the one who has no guardian.

    2083; Ibn Maajah, 1879. Classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi and as saheeh ibn Ibn Hibbaan (9/384) and al-Haakim (2/183).

Dreaming of having sex in Islam","Praise be to Allah.What to do if you see unpleasant dreams?
These and similar unpleasant dreams come from the Shaytan. What is prescribed for the Muslim, if he sees a dream that he dislikes, is to spit drily to his left three times and to seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytan and from the evil of what he has seen, three times, and he should turn over onto his other side. Then it (his dream) will not harm him. And he should not tell anyone about it , because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The good dream comes from Allah and the bad dream comes from the Shaytan. So if any one of you sees a bad dream which frightens him, let him spit drily to his left and seek refuge with Allah from its evil , then it will not harm him.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Bad’ Al-Khalq, 3049) 
Dreaming of having sex in Islam
If a woman sees in a dream that someone is having intercourse with her, this is something natural, for women may experience erotic dreams just as men do. An erotic dream (or “wet dream ”) is when one imagines doing sexual acts in one’s dream. 
It was narrated in a Hadith that Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “Umm Sulaym came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, Allah is not too shy to tell us the truth. Does a woman have to do Ghusl if she experiences an erotic dream ?’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘(Yes), if she sees some wetness.’” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Al-`Ilm, 127). 
Shaykh Al-Bassam (may Allah have mercy on him) said that the word ihtamalat (translated here as “she sees an erotic dream”) refers to whatever a sleeper may see in his dreams, and what it means here is if a woman sees in her dream what men see of images of intercourse and the like.
If a woman sees such things in her dream, then if something comes out of her as a result of that dream, she has to do Ghusl.  But if she simply sees a dream and nothing comes out of her, then she does not have to do Ghusl , because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “If she sees some wetness.” (See Tawdih Al-Ahkam, 1/297)

For example if you drown or are crushed  by a building then you are supposed to go to paridise. Lets say that someone memorized the 99 names of Allah and that person only prayed 1 or 2 prayers everyday. Is that person going to go to paridise? The prophet(saw) said that whoever commits the 99 names of Allah to memory is guarented paridise. Please commment.,,,"Praise be to Allah.According to a saheeh hadeeth, “Allah has ninety-nine names. Whoever counts them will enter Paradise.” Counting them means memorizing them, understanding their meanings, acting in accordance with their implications and calling upon Allah by them. Whoever does that and does not commit any major sin, and upholds regular prayer, will have the hope of entering Paradise. But the one who commits major sins has to repent, and he is still subject to the will of Allah – if Allah wills He will forgive him and if He wills He will punish him. But the person who dies by drowning or being crushed by a falling building is a shaheed (martyr) if he is Muslim, and there is the hope that all his evil deeds will be forgiven except for debt. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-Kareem al-Khudayr.
But according to the most correct scholarly view the person who deliberately neglects prayer altogether is a kaafir who has disbelieved in Allah Almighty, and his abode will be the Fire even if he was drowned or a building collapsed on him.
The proof for this is that the ahaadeeth which promise a specific reward such as entering Paradise or being saved from Hell are subject to the conditions being fulfilled and the obstacles being removed. One of the obstacles to entering Paradise, for example, is neglecting prayer, and one of the conditions for the reward of the shaheed who is killed in battle is that his intention is to fight so that the word of Allah may be supreme, and so on.
We also wish to point out to our brother that Muslim should not object to the rulings of Allah once they have been proven and their meanings have been understood. If he finds something hard to understand, he should question his own reasoning and understanding, not the texts of sharee‘ah.
And Allah is the source of help.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

    Caliphs. There is scholarly consensus on this matter. The sister who is asking this question could marry this man in the presence of her wali 
    (guardian) and two witnesses, and announce the marriage, so as to fulfil the necessary conditions of marriage. It is not essential for that to be 
    registered officially. It is also not necessary for the first wife to know. This is if marriage if possible. If it is not possible then our advice

Is this correct? What is the correct view?",,,"Praise be to Allah.This is one of the matters which have caused widespread problems, both on the individual level and on an ummah-wide scale.
 The Muslim ummah has gone through many crises and difficult times, and it has emerged from them through enlightened thinking, penetrating insight and sound concepts, searching for the right means and weighing up the consequences and causes, and only then taking the appropriate means and approaching matters from the right direction.  Thus – by the will of Allah – they overcame those crises and emerged from those calamities, regaining their honour and past glory. This is how the ummah was during its golden ages.
 But in these later times in which the ummah has been swamped by ignorance and overwhelmed by ideas of heresy and westernization, and bid’ah (reprehensible innovations) and misguidance have become widespread, many Muslims have become confused about this matter. They have made belief in al-qadaa’ wa’l-qadar (the will and decree of Allah) an excuse for laziness, and a justification for not being determined and resolved or thinking about higher matters such as how to achieve glory and success. They have preferred the easy, cheap route to the proper but difficult road.
 Their solution was for a man to rely on al-qadar (Divine decree), and on the fact that Allah is the One Who does whatever He wants; whatever He wills happens and whatever He does not will does not happen – so let His will be done and let His decree come to pass. We have no means of changing anything and we have no involvement in any of that.
 In this manner, many Muslims very easily submitted to the decrees without resisting them by taking the prescribed or permissible means.
 So they did not enjoin what is good, forbid what is evil, wage jihaad against the enemies of Allah, strive to spread knowledge and do away with ignorance, combat destructive thought and misleading ideas… all on the grounds that Allah willed that!
 The truth is that this major disaster and immense misguidance led the ummah into a deep pit of backwardness and decline, and enabled its enemies to overwhelm it, and brought upon it calamity after calamity.
 But taking the appropriate means does not affect belief in al-qadar; in fact it is part of perfecting that belief. Allah decrees things for us, and He wants things from us. What He decrees for us is hidden from us, but what He wants from us, He commands us to do. He wants us to convey the call to the kuffaar even if He knows that they will not believe. He wants us to fight them even if He knows that we will be defeated by them. He wants us to be one ummah even if He knows that there will be divisions and differences among us. He wants us to be severe against the disbelievers and merciful amongst ourselves, even if He knows that we will be too severe with one another, and so on…
 It is this confusion about what Allah wants for us and what He wants from us that has led to the confusion about this matter and caused us to fall into haraam things.
 It is true that Allah is the One Who does whatever He wants, He is the Creator of all things, the One in Whose hand is the sovereignty of all things, the One to Whom belong the keys of the heavens and the earth, but He has created laws according to which this universe operates, although He is Able to go beyond these laws but He does not do this for everyone.
 Believing that Allah is Able to help the believers against the disbelievers does not mean that He will help the believers when they are not doing anything to take the appropriate means, because victory without taking the means is impossible and Allah’s power does not have to do with the impossible, and because it is contrary to Allah’s wisdom, and His power is connected to His wisdom.
 The fact that Allah is Able to do something does not mean that an individual, a group or the ummah is able to do the same thing. Allah’s power is an attribute that is unique to Him, and people’s abilities are unique to them – confusing Allah’s power and belief in it with a person’s ability and doing what Allah has commanded him to do is what makes people sit down and do nothing; this is what paralyzes peoples and nations.
 This is what was noted and pointed out by one of the German orientalists, who said, when recording the history of the Muslims in later periods: “The nature of the Muslim is submission to the will of Allah and acceptance of His decree, and submission with all that he possesses to the One, the Subduer.”
 This obedience has two effects. In the early period of Islam, it played a major role in wars and led to ongoing victory, because it instilled in soldiers the spirit of sacrifice.
 But in later times it was a cause of stagnation which overwhelmed the Muslim world and threw it downhill, keeping it isolated from world events.  (al-‘Almaaniyyah by Shaykh Safar al-Hawaali, quoting from Paul Schamtaz in his book Islam the world power of tomorrow, p. 87)","al-Eemaan bi’l-Qadaa’ wa’l-Qadar by Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem al-Hamad, p. 144"

Evidence for covering the face from the Quran

Evidence for covering the face from rational analogy 




Bad consequences of women showing their faces to non-mahram men","Praise be to Allah.Is covering the face obligatory?
You should note that women’s observing hijab in front of non-mahram men and covering their faces is something that is obligatory as is indicated by the Book of your Lord and the Sunnah of your Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and by rational examination and analogy. 
Evidence for covering the face from the Quran
·        Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent (like both eyes for necessity to see the way, or outer palms of hands or one eye or dress like veil, gloves, headcover, apron), and to draw their veils all over Juyubihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces , necks and bosoms) and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband’s fathers, or their sons, or their husband’s sons, or their brothers or their brother’s sons, or their sister’s sons, or their (Muslim) women (i.e. their sisters in Islam), or the (female) slaves whom their right hands possess, or old male servants who lack vigour, or small children who have no sense of feminine sex. And let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment. And all of you beg Allah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful.” [al-Nur 24:31]
The evidence from this verse that hijab is obligatory for women is as follows: 
1. Allah commands the believing women to guard their chastity, and the command to guard their chastity is also a command to follow all the means of doing that. No rational person would doubt that one of the means of doing so is covering the face, because uncovering it causes people to look at it and enjoy its beauty, and then to initiate contact. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The eyes commit zina and their zina is by looking…” then he said, “… and the private part confirms that or denies it.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6612; Muslim, 2657.
If covering the face is one of the means of guarding one’s chastity, then it is enjoined, because the means come under the same ruling as the ends. 
2. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “…and to draw their veils all over Juyubihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)  …”. The jayb (pl. juyub) is the neck opening of a garment and the khimar (veil) is that with which a woman covers her head. If a woman is commanded to draw her veil over the neck opening of her garment then she is commanded to cover her face, either because that is implied or by analogy. If it is obligatory to cover the throat and chest, then it is more appropriate to cover the face because it is the site of beauty and attraction. 
3. Allah has forbidden showing all adornment except that which is apparent, which is that which one cannot help showing, such as the outside of one's garment. Hence Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “…except only that which is apparent …” and He did not say, except that which they show of it. Some of the salaf, such as Ibn Mas’ud, al-Hasan, Ibn Sirin and others interpreted the phrase “except only that which is apparent” as meaning the outer garment and clothes, and what shows from beneath the outer garment (i.e., the hem of one’s dress etc.). Then He again forbids showing one’s adornment except to those for whom He makes an exception. This indicates that the second adornment mentioned is something other than the first adornment. The first adornment is the external adornment which appears to everyone and cannot be hidden. The second adornment is the inward adornment (including the face). If it were permissible for this adornment to be seen by everyone, there would be no point to the general wording in the first instance and this exception made in the second. 
4. Allah grants a concession allowing a woman to show her inward adornments to “old male servants who lack vigour”, i.e. servants who are men who have no desire, and to small children who have not reached the age of desire and have not seen the ‘awrahs of women. This indicates two things:
I.1 – That showing inward adornments to non-mahrams is not permissible except to these two types of people.
II.2 – That the reason for this ruling is the fear that men may be tempted by the woman and fall in love with her. Undoubtedly the face is the site of beauty and attraction, so concealing it is obligatory lest men who do feel desire be attracted and tempted by her. 
5. The words (interpretation of the meaning): “And let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment” mean that a woman should not stamp her feet so as to make known hidden adornments such as anklets and the like. If a woman is forbidden to stamp her feet lest men be tempted by what they hear of the sound of her anklets etc., then what about uncovering the face? 
Which is the greater source of temptation – a man hearing the anklets of a woman whom he does not know who she is or whether she is beautiful, or whether she is young or old, or ugly or pretty? Or his looking at a beautiful youthful face that attracts him and invites him to look at it? 
Every man who has any desire for women will know which of the two temptations is greater and which deserves to be hidden and concealed. 
·        Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And as for women past childbearing who do not expect wedlock, it is no sin on them if they discard their (outer) clothing in such a way as not to show their adornment. But to refrain (i.e. not to discard their outer clothing) is better for them. And Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.” [al-Nur 24:60]
The evidence from this verse is that Allah states that there is no sin on old women who have no hope of marriage because men have no desire for them, due to their old age (if they discard their outer clothing), subject to the condition that their intention in doing so is not to make a wanton display of themselves. The fact that this ruling applies only to old women indicates that the ruling is different for young women who still hope to get married. If the ruling on discarding the outer clothing applied to all, there would be no point in singling out old women here. 
The phrase “in such a way as not to show their adornment” offers further proof that hijab is obligatory for young women who hope to marry, because usually when they uncover their faces the intention is to make a wanton display (tabarruj) and to show off their beauty and make men look at them and admire them etc. Those who do otherwise are rare, and the ruling does not apply to rare cases.  
·        Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed. And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [al-Ahzab 33:59]
Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Allah commanded the believing women, if they go out of their houses for some need, to cover their faces from the top of their heads with their jilbabs, and to leave one eye showing.” 
The tafsir of the Sahabah is evidence, indeed some of the scholars said that it comes under the same ruling as marfu’ reports that go back to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
The comment “and leave one eye showing” is a concession because of the need to see the way; if there is no need for that then the eye should not be uncovered. 
The jilbab is the upper garment that comes above the khimar; it is like the abaya. 
·        Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is no sin on them (the Prophet’s wives, if they appear unveiled) before their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their brother’s sons, or the sons of their sisters, or their own (believing) women, or their (female) slaves. And (O ladies), fear (keep your duty to) Allah. Verily, Allah is Ever All-Witness over everything.” [al-Ahzab 33:55]
Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: When Allah commanded the women to observe hijab in front of non-mahram men, he explained that they did not have to observe hijab in front of these relatives, as He explained that they are exempted in Surat al-Nur where He said (interpretation of the meaning): “and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands…”  
Evidence from the Sunnah that it is obligatory to cover the face
·        The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you proposes marriage to a woman, there is no sin on him if he looks at her, rather he should look at her for the purpose of proposing marriage even if she is unaware.” Narrated by Ahmad. The author of Majma’ al-Zawaid said: its men are the men of sahih. 
The evidence here is the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said there is no sin on the man who is proposing marriage, subject to the condition that his looking be for the purpose of proposing marriage. This indicates that the one who is not proposing marriage is sinning if he looks at a non-mahram woman in ordinary circumstances, as is the one who is proposing marriage if he looks for any purpose other than proposing marriage, such as for the purpose of enjoyment etc. 
If it is said that the hadith does not clearly state what is being looked at, and it may mean looking at the chest etc, the response is that the man who is proposing marriage looks at the face because it is the focus for the one who is seeking beauty, without a doubt. 
·        When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded that women should be brought out to the ‘Eid prayer place, they said, “O Messenger of Allah, some of us do not have jilbabs.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Let her sister give her one of her jilbabs to wear.” Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim. 
This hadith indicates that the usual practice among the women of the Sahabah was that a woman would not go out without a jilbab, and that if she did not have a jilbab she would not go out. The command to wear a jilbab indicates that it is essential to cover. And Allah knows best. 
·        It was narrated in al-Sahihayn that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray Fajr and the believing women would attend the prayer with him, wrapped in their veils, then they would go back to their homes and no one would recognize them because of the darkness. She said: If the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw from the women what we have seen, he would have prevented them from coming to the mosques as the Children of Israel prevented their women. 
A similar report was also narrated by ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him). 
The evidence from this hadith covers two issues: 
1.      Hijab and covering were the practice of the women of the Sahabah who were the best of generations and the most honourable before Allah. 
2.      `Aishah, the Mother of the Believers, and ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with them both), who were both known as scholars with deep insight, said that if the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had seen from women what they had seen, he would have prevented them from coming to the mosques. This was during the best generations, so what about nowadays?! 
·        It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever lets his garment drag out of pride, Allah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection.” Umm Salamah said, “What should women do with their hems?” He said, “Let it hang down a handspan.” She said, “What if that shows her feet?” He said, “Let it hang down a cubit, but no more than that.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi. 
This hadith indicates that it is obligatory for women to cover their feet, and that this was something that was well known among the women of the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them). The feet are undoubtedly a lesser source of temptation than the face and hands, so a warning concerning something that is less serious is a warning about something that is more serious and to which the ruling applies more. The wisdom of shari’ah means that it would not enjoin covering something that is a lesser source of temptation and allow uncovering something that is a greater source of temptation. This is an impossible contradiction that cannot be attributed to the wisdom and laws of Allah. 
·        It was narrated that `Aishah said: The riders used to pass by us when we were with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in ihram. When they came near us we would lower our jilbabs from our heads over our faces, and when they had passed by we would uncover our faces. Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1562.
 The words “When they came near us we would lower our jilbabs from our heads over our faces” indicate that it is obligatory to cover the face, because what is prescribed in ihram is to uncover it. If there was no strong reason to prevent uncovering it, it would be obligatory to leave it uncovered even when the riders were passing by. In other words, women are obliged to uncover their faces during ihram according to the majority of scholars, and nothing can override something that is obligatory except something else that is also obligatory. If it were not obligatory to observe hijab and cover the face in the presence of non-mahram men, there would be no reason not to uncover it in ihram. It was proven in al-Sahihayn and elsewhere that a woman in ihram is forbidden to wear the niqab (face veil) and gloves. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: This is one of the things which indicate that the niqab and gloves were known among women who were not in ihram, which implies that they covered their faces and hands. 
These are nine points of evidence from the Quran and Sunnah.
Evidence for covering the face from rational analogy 
The tenth evidence is rational examination and analogy which form the basis of this perfect Shari`ah, which aims to help people achieve what is in their best interests and encourages the means that lead to that, and to denounce evil and block the means that lead to it. 
Bad consequences of women showing their faces to non-mahram men
If we think about unveiling and women showing their faces to non-mahram men, we will see that it involves many bad consequences. Even if we assume that there are some benefits in it, they are very few in comparison with its negative consequences. Those negative consequences include: 
1.      Fitnah (temptation). By unveiling her face, a woman may be tempted to do things to make her face look more beautiful. This is one of the greatest causes of evil and corruption. 
2.      Taking away haya (modesty, shyness) from women, which is part of faith and of a woman’s nature (fitrah). Women are examples of modesty, as it was said, “more shy than a virgin in her seclusion.” Taking away a woman’s modesty detracts from her faith and the natural inclination with which she was created. 
3.      Men may be tempted by her, especially if she is beautiful and she flirts, laughs and jokes, as happens in the case of many of those who are unveiled. The Shaytan flows through the son of Adam like blood. 
4.      Mixing of men and women. If a woman thinks that she is equal with men in uncovering her face and going around unveiled, she will not be modest and will not feel too shy to mix with men. This leads to a great deal of fitnah (temptation) and widespread corruption. Al-Tirmidhi narrated (5272) from Hamzah ibn Abi Usayd from his father that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, when he was coming out of the mosque and he saw men mingling with women in the street; the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to the women, “Draw back, and do not walk in the middle of the road; keep to the sides of the road.” Then the women used to keep so close to the walls that their garments would catch on the walls because they kept so close to them. (Classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 929)

11783,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11783,What is the fault of children born in a kaafir environment?,"People born and raised in different environments and religions naturally develop different temperaments and identities. A person born in a Hindu family becomes a Hindu upon growing up. For him the Hindu religion is perfect. For such a person it is ingrained into his nature from his childhood that he is a Hindu first and last. Supposingly he receives the message of Islam. What are the chances that he will give up his religion, his identity and accept a new one. Isn't it tough for this person to become Muslim as compared to someone born a Muslim. It scares me to think that if I were born into some other faith than Islam where would I be today. So why is it not the law that everyone does have an equal opportunity to experience and accept Islam from the cradle. It this a matter of Allah's will, Sprituality (Hidayah) or Human Psychology. Please respond with references from Quran and hadith.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So set you (O Muhammad) your face towards the religion (of pure 
          Islamic Monotheism) Haneef (worship none but Allaah Alone). Allaah’s 
          Fitrah (i.e. Allaah’s Islamic Monotheism) with which He has created 
          mankind. No change let there be in Khalq‑illaah (i.e. the religion 
          of Allaah   Islamic Monotheism), that is the straight religion, 
          but most of men know not” [al-Room 30:30]  
It was narrated from Abu 
          Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) said: “Every child is born in a state of fitrah (the natural 
          state of man, i.e., Islam), then his parents make him into a Jew or 
          a Christian or a Magian.” (Agreed upon).   
The correct view is that what is meant by fitrah is the 
          religion of Islam, as stated in the hadeeth narrated by Muslim from 
          the Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who said: “Allaah said: ‘I created 
          My slaves as haneefs (believers in pure monotheism), then the Shaytaan 
          misled them from their religion; he forbade them what I had permitted 
          to them and commanded them to associate others with Me for which I had 
          not sent down any authority.’” What it means when it is said that a 
          child is born as a Muslim is that he is born inherently ready, when 
          he reaches the age of discretion, if he is given the choice between 
          Islam and its opposite, to prefer Islam over its opposite and to choose 
          Islam as his religion, so long as there is nothing to prevent him from 
          doing so, such as his whims and desires or tribalism. Following his 
          desires makes him prefer falsehood so that he may attain some share 
          of leadership or wealth, and tribalism or racial pride makes him follow 
          his forefathers or elders, even if they are not following true guidance. 
          Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Nay! They say: ‘We found 
          our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we guide ourselves 
          by their footsteps’” [al-Zukhruf 43:23] 
And Allaah tells us what the followers among the people of Hell will 
          say (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And they will say: ‘Our Lord! Verily, we obeyed our chiefs and 
          our great ones, and they misled us from the (Right) Way’” [al-Ahzaab 
          33:67]   
If every child 
          is born in a state of fitrah, then obviously there will be some who 
          will be influenced in ways that are in accordance with that fitrah and 
          will strengthen it, such as those who are born to Muslim parents and 
          grow up in a Muslim society. And there will be some whose fitrah is 
          changed, such as those who are born to kaafir parents and group up among 
          the kuffaar, be they Jews, Christians, Magians or mushrikeen. Undoubtedly 
          the one who is born in Islam has means of guidance and happiness which 
          are not available to others who are born and grow up in kaafir societies. 
          Being given easy access to the means of faith and guidance is a blessing 
          from Allaah which He gives to whomsoever He wills. It should also be 
          noted that the person whose fitrah has been changed from Islam will 
          not be punished for the sins of another; rather he will be punished 
          if the call of the Messenger  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) reaches him and he does not accept 
          it out of stubbornness, arrogance or tribalistic pride in the religion 
          of his forefathers and countrymen, because proof is established against 
          him when the call of the Messenger reaches him, and in such a case, 
          if he persists in his kufr then he deserves to be punished. Allaah says 
          (interpretation of the meaning):
“And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning)” 
          [al-Israa’ 17:15]   
What you say in your question, 
          “It scares me to think…”, is correct and is wise, for it is the blessing 
          of Allaah upon you that you were born in Islam. If you had been born 
          into another religion, there would have been the fear that you might 
          remain in that false religion, but when Allaah wills good for His slave, 
          He makes it easy for him to have the means of guidance which will bring 
          him from the religion of kufr to the religion of Islam. The entire matter 
          is up to Allaah.  
But when you say in your question, “So why is it not the 
          law that…?” this is a false question caused by unawareness of the wisdom 
          of Allaah and His ways of dealing with His creation. Of course it is 
          impossible for the same opportunities to be available to all, because 
          there are so many different human religions, and guidance to Islam happens 
          when a person chooses to be guided, because Allaah has given man the 
          ability to distinguish between truth and falsehood, between what is 
          beneficial and what is harmful, by means of the reason that He has instilled 
          in him, and the explanations with which He has sent His Messengers. 
          At the same time, the will of the person is subject to the will of Allaah, 
          for He is the One Who sends astray whomsoever He wills by His justice 
          and wisdom, and He guides whomsoever He will by His grace and wisdom.  
          
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, this (the Qur’aan) is no less than a Reminder to (all) 
          the ‘Aalameen (mankind and jinn) 
To whomsoever among you who wills to walk straight. 
And you cannot will unless 
          (it be) that Allaah wills the Lord of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinn and

1.	She was patient, devoted to Islam, generous, chaste, devout and thankful to Allah. 
2.	Fatimah’s speech most closely resembled that of the Messenger of Allah.
3.	The Prophet loved her and honoured her.
4.	Prophet Muhammad said: “Fatimah is a part of me, and whoever angers her, angers me.”",,"Praise be to Allah.Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her), the daughter of the leader of mankind, Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), Al-Qurashiyyah Al-Hashimiyyah, is the mother of Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn (may Allah be pleased with them). 
She was born shortly before the beginning of the Mission of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and she married `Ali ibn Abu Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) after the battle of Badr. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) loved her and honoured her. She (may Allah be pleased with her) was patient, devoted to Islam, generous, chaste, devout and thankful to Allah. 
When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died, she grieved and wept for him, and said, “O my father, to Jibril we tell the news of his death, O my father, he answered the call of his Lord, O my father, in Paradise is his eternal abode.” 
Fatimah’s speech most closely resembled that of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “I never saw anyone whose speech more closely resembled that of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) than Fatimah. When she entered upon him, he would stand up to greet her, kiss her and welcome her, and she would do the same for him.” 
Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) lived for six months after the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). She was buried at night. Al-Waqidi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: this is the most correct view. He said, Al-`Abbas prayed (the funeral prayer) for her, and he, `Ali and Al-Fadl (may Allah be pleased with them) lowered her into her grave. 
Her sons were Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn (may Allah be pleased with them) and her daughters were Umm Kulthum, who was wed by `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), and Zaynab who was wed by `Abdullah ibn Ja`far ibn Abu Talib. 
It was narrated from Masruq (may Allah have mercy on him) that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “Fatimah came walking in the manner of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, `Welcome, O my daughter.’ Then he seated her to his right or to his left, then he said something privately to her and she wept. I said to her, `Why are you weeping?’ Then he said something privately to her and she smiled. I said, `I have never seen anything like that which I have seen today, of joy so close to grief.’ I asked her what he had said, and she said, `I would not disclose the secret of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).’ When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed away, I asked her and she said, `He told me, “Jibril used to review the Quran with me once every year, but this year he has reviewed it with me twice, so I know that my appointed time (of death) is approaching. And you will be the first of my family to join me.” So I wept. Then he said, “Would it not please you to be the leader of the women of Paradise or the women of the believers?” So I smiled.’” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Al-Manaqib, 3353) 
Among the things that prove her virtue is that which was narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim from `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray at the Ka`bah, and Abu Jahl and his companions were sitting there. They said to one another, `Who will bring the intestines of the camel of so and so and put it on Muhammad’s back when he prostrates?’ So the most wretched of people went and brought it and waited until the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prostrated, then he put it on his back, between his shoulders. I was watching but I could not help him because I did not have any power. They started laughing and leaning against one another (because of their laughter), and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was prostrating and did not raise his head until Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) came and removed it from his back. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) raised his head, and said, `O Allah, deal with Quraysh,’ three times. They became worried when he prayed against them, because they used to believe that Du`as made in that land would be answered…” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 233 and Muslim, 3349) 
Also, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Fatimah is a part of me, and whoever angers her, angers me.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 3437 and Muslim, 4483)

•	If the `Iddah has ended following a first or second pronouncement of divorce, then there has to be a new marriage contract.
•	If the divorce is irrevocable (i.e., third divorce) , then she becomes prohibited for him until another man has married her.",,"Praise be to Allah.If a man divorces his wife and this is the first or second pronouncement of divorce and she has not ended her `iddah (by giving birth if she is pregnant or by the passage of three menstrual cycles if she is not pregnant), then he can take his wife back by saying, “I am taking you back” or “I am keeping you.” Then his taking her back is valid. Or he may do some action intending thereby to take her back, such as having intercourse with the intention of taking her back. 
The Sunnah is to have two witnesses to the fact that he has taken her back , so that two witnesses testify to that, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Then when they are about to attain their term appointed, either take them back in a good manner or part with them in a good manner. And take as witness two just persons from among you (Muslims).” [At-Talaq 65:2]
In this manner a man may take his wife back. 
But if the `Iddah has ended following a first or second pronouncement of divorce, then there has to be a new marriage contract. In this case, he has to propose marriage like any other man, to her guardian and to her. 
When she and her guardian agree and they agree upon a Mahr, then the marriage contract is completed. That must be done in the presence of two just witnesses. 
But if the divorce is the final – i.e., third – divorce, then she becomes prohibited for him until another man has married her , because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if he has divorced her (the third time), then she is not lawful unto him thereafter until she has married another husband.” [Al-Baqarah 2:230]
So it is not permissible for him to marry her unless she has been married to another man and the marriage has been consummated, then he leaves her either through death or divorce. This marriage must be a legitimate Shar`i marriage; if she marries him just to make it permissible for her to go back to her first husband, that is not permitted and she does not become permissible (to the first husband).
