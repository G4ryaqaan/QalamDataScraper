13003,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13003,"Ruling on watching TV, videos and satellite channels",What is the ruling on watching TV? On watching depraved videos? On installing a satellite dish in the home?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Watching TV is very dangerous, and I advise you not to watch it and not to sit in front of it as far as possible. But if the viewer has the moral strength to benefit from what is good, and that will not lead him into evil, then there is nothing to prevent him from that, if he knows that he has that moral strength. If he can listen to something good and benefit from it, and keep away from evil things such as songs and objectionable dramas and other harmful things, then there is nothing wrong with that. But usually the one thing leads to the other, so I advise people not to bring the TV into the home and not to watch it, because one thing leads to another, and because people are inclined to watch weird things if they are in front of them. It is not like listening; listening is less dangerous, but watching and listening may be more attractive and more addictive to people.
 More evil than that are videos, if they contain depraved films and are circulated among people – we seek refuge with Allah. These depraved video movies are more evil, and we must beware of them. The wise person, if he finds anything of that nature, must destroy it or record something over it in order to remove the evil. If possible, he should record something useful over it, so as to remove the evil thing and so that some benefit may be gained from the tape on which something good has been recorded.
 Even more evil are satellite dishes. We must beware of them and not install them in our homes. May Allah keep the Muslims safe from all evil.","Kitaab Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 9, p. 384"
13004,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13004,Warning and comment on the Peking Women’s Conference,What is the view of the Muslim scholars on the recommendations of the Peking Women's Conference? What is the ruling on getting rid of all forms of discrimination against women?,,,"Praise be to Allah.The fourth international conference on women has been announced in 
          the media, to be held from 9-20/4/1416 (4/10/1995) in Peking, the capital 
          of China. I have read a agenda prepared for this conference  which 
          includes 362 items in 177 pages, and the statements published by a number 
          of scholars in the Muslim world stating the danger posed by this conference 
          and the evil consequences it will bring to humanity in general and the 
          Muslims in particular. It became clear to us, from the agenda mentioned 
          above, that this conference is a follow-up to the conference on population 
          and development which was held in Cairo in Rabee’ al-Thaani 1415 AH,  
          concerning which statements were issued by the Council of Senior Scholars 
          and the Founding Committee of the Muslim World League, both of which 
          were headed by myself. The two statements both condemned the conference 
          mentioned, because it went against the religion of Islam and opposed 
          Allaah and His Messenger  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and because it promoted promiscuity 
          and the violation of sanctities, and aimed to turn human societies into 
          herds of animals, so the conference should be boycotted… etc.  
          
Now comes this conference which is along the same lines as the Cairo 
          conference, focusing on the equality of men and women in all areas. 
          The proposals of the document referred to above have been adopted by 
          the General Secretariat of the United Nations on the basis of principles 
          of kufr and misguided means of achieving that, including the following: 
            
Calling for the abolition of any law that distinguishes between men 
          and women on the grounds of religion; calling for promiscuity in the 
          name of “practising safe sex”; encouraging single-parent families; educating 
          the youth, boys and girls, about sexual matters; fighting discrimination 
          between men and women; calling upon young men and women to destroy the 
          differences between the two sexes that are based on religion; telling 
          them that religion is an obstacle to equality… and other obvious examples 
          of kufr and misguidance that are mentioned in the document. This plot 
          is against Islam and the Muslims, and indeed against humanity as a whole, 
          to rid it of chastity, modesty and honour.  
Hence it is obligatory for the Muslim authorities and all those to 
          whom Allaah has given power over the Muslims’ affairs, to boycott this 
          conference and to take the necessary measures of preventing its evils 
          from reaching the Muslims. They must present a united front against 
          this immoral assault. The Muslims must take precautions against the 
          plots of the plotters and the hatred of those who hate.  
We ask Allaah to foil the plots of our enemies and turn them against 
          them. We ask them to bring these efforts of theirs to naught, and to 
          give the Muslims and their leaders the strength to do what is in their 
          best interests. May He reform them, men and woman alike, and grant them 
          happiness and salvation in this world and in the Hereafter, for He is 
          the One Who is Able to do that. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad 
          and his family and companions, and grant them peace.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 9, no. 203"
13005,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13005,The effect of sihr on the marital relationship,"Can sihr (magic, witchcraft) have an affect on the marital relationship?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The 
          saahir (person who practises 
          sihr) does things by which he affects people with sihr. Sometimes this 
          is by illusion or making things appear to be something else, as Allaah 
          said concerning the sorcerers of Pharaoh (interpretation of the meaning): 
           
        “and 
          their sticks, by their magic, appeared to him as though they moved fast” 
          [Ta-Ha 20:66] 
They 
          do actions that change how things look in people’s eyes, so that they 
          see things other than they really are, as Allaah says in Soorat 
          al-A’raaf (interpretation of the meaning):  
          
“So 
          when they threw, they bewitched the eyes of the people, and struck terror 
          into them, and they displayed a great magic” [al-A’raaf 7:116]  
          
So 
          they do things to bewitch people’s eyes, so that they see a rope as 
          a snake or a stick as a moving snake, when it is not a snake at all 
          but only a stick or a rope.  
          
They 
          may also bewitch people in other ways, so that a man becomes hateful 
          to his wife, or vice versa. They may do this by bewitching their eyes, 
          or by giving them evil potions which they get from the shayaateen, or 
          by tying knots on which they blow and pray to the shayaateen instead 
          of to Allaah, and seek their help in harming people. So a man may imagine 
          that his wife is not the wife he knows, and she may appear ugly or hateful 
          to him, or a wife may imagine that her husband is not the husband that 
          she knows, and she sees him as something ugly and terrifying, because 
          of what these criminals have done. So their sihr may be of two types, 
          one of which involves illusions and tricking the eyes, so that they 
          do not see things as they really are.  
          
The 
          other kind includes that which is called al-sarf 
          and al-‘atf (spells aimed at creating hatred or love), which is 
          done by tying knots and blowing on them, and using potions which they 
          make by inspiration of the shayaateen. This second kind may make a man 
          love or hate his wife, or a woman love or hate her husband. It may also 
          affect a person's relationship with people other than his or her spouse. 
          Hence Allaah has commanded us to seek refuge with Him from the evil 
          of those who blow onto knots, and to seek refuge with Him from every 
          evil.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 8, p. 80"
13019,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13019,It is not permissible to swear by salaah (prayer) or by honesty,"Is it permissible to affirm what you are saying to your brother by saying “by your prayer” or “by your honesty”, or by saying, “you will be in a critical state if you do that?” Such things are widespread among women and children. We hope that you can advise us, may Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to swear by prayer, honesty, critical situations or any other created thing. One should swear only by Allaah. One should not say “By my honesty I will do such and such”, or “by the honesty of So and so”, or “by the life of So and so” or “by my prayer”. Nor should one ask anyone else to do this and tell them, “Say ‘by my honesty/by my prayer/ by my zakaah.’” There is no basis for any of this, because prayer is the action of a person and zakaah is the action of a person, and people’s actions are not something to swear by. One should swear only by Allaah or by His attributes, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever swears, let him swear by Allaah or keep silent.” (Saheeh, agreed upon). And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever swears by anything other than Allaah has committed shirk.” (Narrated by Imaam Ahmad with a saheeh isnaad from ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him)). It was also narrated by al-Tirmidhi and Abu Dawood with a saheeh isnaad from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), with the wording, “Whoever swears by anything other than Allaah has committed kufr or shirk.” And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever swears by honesty is not one of us.” So every believing man and woman has to beware of that and not swear by anything except Allaah alone, so he should say “Wallaahi (by Allaah) I did not do such and such”, etc., if that is necessary. What is recommended in sharee’ah is to be cautious about swearing oaths, and not to swear except when essential. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And protect your oaths (i.e. do not swear much)”[al-Maa’idah 5:89]
 But if it is necessary, then one may swear by saying, “By Allaah, I did not do such and such”, provided that he is telling the truth, or, “By Allaah, I did not go to So and so” etc. If he is telling the truth, then there is nothing wrong with that, because this is swearing by Allaah when there is a need to do so. But swearing by honesty or by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), by the Ka’bah, or by the life of So and so, or by the honour of So and so, or by my prayer, or by my honesty – this is not permissible, as stated above, because of the ahaadeeth quoted.
 But if a person says “Trust me (lit. in my trust)”, this is not an oath; this means that this is something which has been entrusted to me and for which I am responsible. But if a person says “by my trust/ by my prayer/ by my father’s life”, this is not permissible, because he is swearing by something other than Allaah. We ask Allaah to guide us all.","Kitaab Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 9, p"

These operations may include: removing an extra finger and repairing the site to look normal; removing extra teeth and straightening the remaining teeth to make the mouth look normal; closing a cleft palate or “harelip” and making it look normal; removing scars and deformities caused by burns; straightening a large and crooked nose that is making it difficult to breathe; repairing an incomplete ear to make it look whole; correcting drooping eyelids which are interfering with a person's vision; doing facelifts to make the face look normal; performing breast reduction on a woman whose spine is being adversely affected by the unbalanced heavy weight of her breasts; tightening sagging abdominal skin or muscles (“tummy tuck”); correcting the urethra in men in cases where incontinence is causing soiling of clothing; removing deforming spots from the face; melting body fat (liposuction) which may cause many diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Please note that when these operations are done, the deformity will not recur, in sha Allah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with treating the diseases mentioned with treatments that are prescribed in sharee’ah or that are permissible, administered by specialized doctors who is certain that the operation is most likely to be successful. This is because of the general meaning of the shar’i evidence (daleel) which indicates that it is permissible to treat the sick with medicines that are prescribed in sharee’ah or are permissible. With regard to haram medicines, such as alcohol and so on, it is not permissible to use them for treatment. Among the shar’i evidence concerning that are the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him):
“Allah has not sent down any disease but He has also sent down the cure.”
For every disease there is a medicine, and if the medicine hits the disease, it will be cured, in sha Allah.”
“Whoever among you can benefit his brother, then let him do so.”
“O slaves of Allah, seek treatment but do not seek treatment with that which is haram.”
“Allah does not make your healing in that which He has forbidden for you.”

But my mother – may Allaah forgive her – does not want me to wear hijaab and she tells me to watch movies at the cinema and on video, etc. She says to me, “If you don’t enjoy yourself and have fun, you will become an old woman and your hair will turn grey.”",,,"Praise be to Allah.You have to be kind to your mother and treat her well and 
          talk to her in a nice manner, because the rights of the mother are great 
          indeed. But you do not have to obey her in anything that is not right, 
          because the Prophet  (peace and 
          blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Obedience is only with regard 
          to that which is right and proper.” And he  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “There is no obedience 
          to any created being if it involves disobedience to the Creator.” The 
          same applies to one’s father, husband and others; they should not be 
          obeyed in matters of sin because of the hadeeth mentioned above. But 
          a wife, child, etc., has to use kindness and good manners in order to 
          solve problems, by explaining the evidence of sharee’ah and the obligation 
          of obeying Allaah and His Messenger and of avoiding sin, of adhering 
          steadfastly to the truth and not obeying any command from a husband, 
          father, mother, etc., that goes against the truth. 
There is nothing to prevent you watching anything on TV 
          or video that does not contain anything evil, or listening to educational 
          broadcasts or useful lessons. But beware of watching anything in which 
          evil things are shown. It is also not permissible to go to the cinema 
          because of the various kinds of evil involved. 
It is not advisable to have a television at home because 
          so much of what it shows is false or haraam. Your mother’s telling you 
          that if you do not enjoy yourself and have fun, you will become an old 
          woman and your hair will turn grey is just foolish nonsense; it is like 
          the myths and stories that children tell. So do not listen to these 
          words. But there is nothing wrong with having fun if it is permissible, 
          such as going to rivers, looking at the trees and hunting. But if the

13043,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13043,Ibraaheem (peace be upon him),Could you give us some information about the Prophet Ibraaheem (peace be upon him)?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah sent His Prophet Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) and ordained among his offspring Prophethood and the Book (al-‘Ankaboot 29:27). 
“And mention in the Book (the Qur’aan) Ibraaheem (Abraham). Verily, he was a man of truth, a Prophet [Maryam 19:41 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Allaah guided Ibraaheem and honoured him with virtues and praiseworthy characteristics: 
“Verily, Ibraaheem (Abraham) was an Ummah (a leader having all the good righteous qualities), or a nation, obedient to Allaah, Haneef (i.e. to worship none but Allaah), and he was not one of those who were Al-Mushrikoon (polytheists, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allaah, and those who joined partners with Allaah).
(He was) thankful for His (Allaah’s) Favours. He (Allaah) chose him (as an intimate friend) and guided him to a Straight Path (Islamic Monotheism — neither Judaism nor Christianity).
And We gave him good in this world, and in the Hereafter he shall be of the righteous”[al-Nahl 16:120-122 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) was the father of the Prophets; no Prophet was sent after him but he was from among his descendents. He had two sons whom Allaah chose to be Prophets. They were Ismaa’eel the grandfather of the Arabs, from among whose descendents Allaah sent the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and Ishaaq whom Allaah blessed with a Prophet called Ya’qoob, who was also known as Israa’eel, after whom Bani Israa’eel (the Children of Israel) and their Prophets were called. 
The Qur’aan refers to the fact that Ibraaheem was the father of the Prophets, when it says concerning Ibraaheem (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We bestowed upon him Ishaaq (Isaac) and Ya‘qoob (Jacob), each of them We guided, and before him, We guided Nooh (Noah), and among his progeny Dawood (David), Sulaymaan (Solomon), Ayyoob (Job), Yoosuf (Joseph), Moosa (Moses), and Haaroon (Aaron). Thus do We reward Al-Muhsinoon (the good-doers).
And Zakariyya (Zachariya), and Yahya (John) and ‘Eesa (Jesus) and Ilyaas (Elias), each one of them was of the righteous.
And Isma‘eel (Ishmael) and Al-Yasaa‘ (Elisha), and Yoonus (Jonah) and Loot (Lot), and each one of them We preferred above the ‘Aalameen [mankind and jinn (of their times)]”[al-An’aam 6:84-86] 
Ibraaheem called his people in Mesopotamia to worship Allaah alone and to stop worshipping the idols which could neither bring benefit nor cause harm. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) Ibraaheem (Abraham) when he said to his people: ‘Worship Allaah (Alone), and fear Him: that is better for you if you did but know.
You worship besides Allaah only idols, and you only invent falsehood. Verily, those whom you worship besides Allaah have no power to give you provision, so seek your provision from Allaah (Alone), and worship Him (Alone), and be grateful to Him. To Him (Alone) you will be brought back’”[al-‘Ankaboot 29:16-17]  
Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) wanted to free his people from idol-worship and rid them of myths and legends. He asked his people about these idols, as Allaah tells us (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And recite to them the story of Ibraaheem (Abraham).
When he said to his father and his people: ‘What do you worship?’
They said: ‘We worship idols, and to them we are ever devoted.’
He said: ‘Do they hear you, when you call on (them)?
Or do they benefit you or do they harm (you)?’
They said: ‘(Nay) but we found our fathers doing so’”[al-Shu’araa’ 26:69-74] 
Then he explained to them that they should not mindlessly follow others like dumb animals and clarified for them the ultimate reality which is that they should worship Allaah alone, in Whose hand is the dominion of all things: 
“He said: ‘Do you observe that which you have been worshipping
You and your ancient fathers?
Verily, they are enemies to me, save the Lord of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists),
Who has created me, and it is He Who guides me.
And it is He Who feeds me and gives me to drink.
And when I am ill, it is He Who cures me.
And Who will cause me to die, and then will bring me to life (again).
And Who, I hope, will forgive me my faults on the Day of Recompense (the Day of Resurrection)’”[al-Shu’araa’ 26:75-82] 
The father of Ibraaheem was one of the idol-worshippers. He used to carve them and sell them. His father’s disbelief troubled Ibraaheem, so he singled him out for advice and said to him: 
“O my father! Why do you worship that which hears not, sees not and cannot avail you in anything?
O my father! Verily, there has come to me of the knowledge that which came not unto you. So follow me, I will guide you to the Straight Path”[Maryam 19:42-43 – interpretation of the meaning]  
But his father did not respond to him, rather he threatened to stone him and forsake him. He said: 
“Do you reject my gods, O Ibraaheem (Abraham)? If you stop not (this), I will indeed stone you. So get away from me safely (before I punish you)”[Maryam 19:46 – interpretation of the meaning] 
So Ibraaheem had no choice but to leave him, and he said to him:
 “Peace be on you! I will ask forgiveness of my Lord for you. Verily, He is unto me Ever Most Gracious[Maryam 19:47 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Ibraaheem continued to ask for forgiveness for his father and to ask his Lord to guide him, but when it became clear to him that he (his father) was an enemy of Allaah, he disavowed him and stopped asking for forgiveness for him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And Ibraaheem’s (Abraham) invoking (of Allaah) for his father’s forgiveness was only because of a promise he [Ibraaheem (Abraham)] had made to him (his father). But when it became clear to him that he (his father) is an enemy of Allaah, he dissociated himself from him. Verily, Ibraaheem was Awwah (one who invokes Allaah with humility, glorifies Him and remembers Him much) and was forbearing[al-Tawbah 9:114] 
When the people of Ibraaheem persisted in worshipping idols, Ibraaheem wanted to prove to them in practical terms that these idols could not cause harm or bring benefit, after his preaching and teaching had no effect on his people: 
“Then he cast a glance at the stars,
And he said: ‘Verily, I am sick (with plague). [He did this trick to remain in their temple of idols to destroy them and not to accompany them to the pagan feast)].’
So they turned away from him, and departed (for fear of the disease).
Then he turned to their aalihah (gods) and said: ‘Will you not eat (of the offering before you)?
What is the matter with you that you speak not?’
Then he turned upon them, striking (them) with (his) right hand”
[al-Saaffaaat :88:93] 
Ibraaheem broke all the idols except the biggest one, which he left so that they could ask it who had done this: 
“So he broke them to pieces, (all) except the biggest of them, that they might turn to it”
[al-Anbiyaa’ 21:58 – interpretation of the meaning] 
When they came back from the festival for which they had gone out, they saw the broken idols and they accused Ibraaheem (of breaking them). He said to them: 
“Nay, this one, the biggest of them (idols) did it. Ask them, if they can speak!”
[al-Anbiyaa’ 21:63 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Because they knew that these idols could not speak – for they were inanimate objects – they said to Ibraaheem: 
“Indeed you [Ibraaheem (Abraham)] know well that these (idols) speak not!”
[al-Anbiyaa’ 21:65 – interpretation of the meaning] 
When they admitted that these idols could do nothing, Ibraaheem said to them:
 “Do you then worship besides Allaah, things that can neither profit you, nor harm you?
Fie upon you, and upon that which you worship besides Allaah! Have you then no sense?”
[al-Anbiyaa’ 21:67 – interpretation of the meaning] 
When they had exhausted all lines of argument, they resorted to the use of force and said: 
“Burn him and help your aalihah (gods), if you will be doing”
[al-Anbiyaa’ 21:68 – interpretation of the meaning] 
They gathered a lot of wood and started a fire which had great sparks and flames, then they threw Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) into that fire. He said, “Hasbi Allaah wa ni’am al-wakeel (Allaah is sufficient for me and He is the best Disposer of affairs).” So Allaah saved him from it and made it coolness and safety for him, and foiled the plot of his enemies: 
“We (Allaah) said: ‘O fire! Be you coolness and safety for Ibraaheem (Abraham)!’
And they wanted to harm him, but We made them the worst losers”
[al-Anbiyaa’ 21:69-70 – interpretation of the meaning]
 After saving Ibraaheem from the fire, Allaah commanded him to leave Mesopotamia and migrate to the Holy Land in Palestine. He married his cousin (the daughter of his paternal uncle) – Saarah – and set out with her and his brother’s son Loot for Syria, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We rescued him and Loot (Lot) to the land which We have blessed for the ‘Aalameen (mankind and jinn)[al-Anbiyaa’ 21:71] 
Then great hardship befell the land of Syria, so Ibraaheem moved to Egypt with his wife, then he came back to Palestine, bringing his wife and a slave woman of hers called Haajar. Ibraaheem longed to have children, but his wife was barren and had grown old. When she saw how much her husband longed to have a child, she gave her slave woman, Haajar, to him. So he married her and was blessed with his son Ismaa’eel from her: 
“’My Lord! Grant me (offspring) from the righteous.’
So We gave him the glad tidings of a forbearing boy”
[al-Saaffaat 37:100-101 – interpretation of the meaning] 
After Haajar gave birth to Ismaa’eel, Saarah began to feel jealous, so she asked Ibraaheem to send them away from her. Allaah revealed to Ibraaheem that he should take Haajar and the infant Ismaa’eel and take them to Makkah. So he took them and left Haajar and her child Ismaa’eel in an bleak, isolated place in which there was no water, then he left them and went back to Palestine. Haajar said to him, “For whom are you leaving us in this forsaken valley?” But Ibraaheem went and left her, and she said, “Has Allaah commanded you to do this?” He said, “Yes.” She said, “Then Allaah will not cause us to be lost.” 
Ibraaheem submitted to the command of his Lord and patiently bore the separation from his wife and child. Then he turned towards where they were at the Sacred House and prayed for them in the following words (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in an uncultivable valley by Your Sacred House (the Ka‘bah at Makkah) in order, O our Lord, that they may perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah). So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allaah) provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks”[Ibraaheem 14:37] 
Haajar stayed in Makkah, eating the food and drinking the water that Ibraaheem had left for her and her son. When that ran out, she and her son became thirsty. She looked for water, and climbed the hill of al-Safaa but she did not see anything. Then she climbed the hill of al-Marwah but she did not see anything. She did that seven times, then she turned towards Ismaa’eel and saw water gushing from beneath his feet. She rejoiced and drank some, and gave some to her son to drink. Then a tribe – Jurham – came to Haajar and asked her permission to settle by the water. She gave them permission and they settled beside her. When Ismaa’eel grew up, he married one of their women and learned Arabic from them. 
During this period, Ibraaheem used to visit his son from time to time. On one of these visits, Ibraaheem saw in a dream that Allaah was commanding him to sacrifice his son Ismaa’eel. The dreams of the Prophets are true, so Ibraaheem resolved to obey the command of Allaah, even though he was old and Ismaa’eel was his only son. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So We gave him the glad tidings of a forbearing boy.
And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him, he said: ‘O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you (offering you in sacrifice to Allaah). So look what you think!’ He said: ‘O my father! Do that which you are commanded, In sha’ Allaah (if Allaah wills), you shall find me of As-Saabiroon (the patient).’
Then, when they had both submitted themselves (to the Will of Allaah), and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead (or on the side of his forehead for slaughtering);
We called out to him: ‘O Ibraaheem!
You have fulfilled the dream!’ Verily, thus do We reward the Muhsinoon (good-doers).
Verily, that indeed was a manifest trial.
And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice (i.e. a ram)”
[al-Saffaat 37:101-107] 
Then Allaah gave him the glad tidings of another son, who was Ishaaq, and then Ibraaheem returned to Palestine: 
“And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaaq (Isaac) a Prophet from the righteous[al-Saaffaat 37:112 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Ishaaq was born to him from his wife Saarah: 
“And his wife was standing (there), and she laughed [either, because the messengers did not eat their food or for being glad for the destruction of the people of Loot (Lot)]. But We gave her glad tidings of Ishaaq (Isaac), and after Ishaaq, of Ya‘qoob (Jacob)”
[Hood 11:71 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Then Ibraaheem stayed in Palestine for a while, then he returned to Makkah for an important reason. Allaah had commanded him to build in Makkah the first House to be built for the worship of Allaah. So Ibraaheem undertook this task of construction, and his son Ismaa’eel was lifting up the stones to him. When the walls grew higher, Ibraaheem stood on a rock, and this is the Station of Ibraaheem (Maqaam Ibraaheem) which is to be found in the vicinity of the Ka’bah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“And (remember) when Ibraaheem (Abraham) and (his son) Ismaaee‘eel (Ishmael) were raising the foundations of the House (the Ka‘bah at Makkah), (saying), ‘Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us. Verily, You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower’”
[al-Baqarah 2:127] 
Allaah commanded Ibraaheem and Ismaa’eel to cleanse the House of idols and other impurities so that it would be pure for those who would circumambulate it and stand and bow and prostrate (in prayer). When Ibraaheem built the House, Allaah commanded him to call mankind to perform the Hajj, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And proclaim to mankind the Hajj (pilgrimage). They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel, they will come from every deep and distant (wide) mountain highway (to perform Hajj)”
[al-Hajj 22:27] 
Then Ibraaheem offered this great supplication for Makkah and for those who live in it: 
“And (remember) when Ibraaheem (Abraham) said, ‘My Lord, make this city (Makkah) a place of security and provide its people with fruits, such of them as believe in Allaah and the Last Day.’ He (Allaah) answered: ‘As for him who disbelieves, I shall leave him in contentment for a while, then I shall compel him to the torment of the Fire, and worst indeed is that destination!’”
[al-Baqarah 2:126 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Then he prayed for himself and his descendents, saying: 
“Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us. Verily, You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.
Our Lord! And make us submissive unto You and of our offspring a nation submissive unto You, and show us our Manaasik (all the ceremonies of pilgrimage — Hajj and ‘Umrah), and accept our repentance. Truly, You are the One Who accepts repentance, the Most Merciful”[al-Baqarah 2:127-128 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Then he prayed for the people of the sanctuary, that Allaah would send to them a Messenger from amongst them, who would call them to worship Allaah Alone. He said: 
“Our Lord! Send amongst them a Messenger of their own, who shall recite unto them Your Verses and instruct them in the Book (this Qur’aan) and Al-Hikmah (full knowledge of the Islamic laws and jurisprudence or wisdom or Prophethood), and purify them. Verily, You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise”
[al-Baqarah 1:129 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Allaah responded to the prayer of His Prophet Ibraaheem. He made Makkah a place of security, He blessed its people with fruits and sent to them a Messenger from amongst themselves, who was the Seal of the Prophets and Messengers, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). All praise and thanks be to Allaah. 
After Ibraaheem, Prophethood remained with the Children of Israel for a long time, until Allaah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) from among the descendents of Ismaa’eel as a Messenger to all of mankind, and commanded him as He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allaah…’”[al-A’raaf 7:158] 
Allaah commanded Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to follow the religion of Ibraaheem, as He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Then, We have sent the Revelation to you (O Muhammad saying): ‘Follow the religion of Ibraaheem (Abraham) Haneef (Islamic Monotheism — to worship none but Allaah) and he was not of the Mushrikoon (polytheists, idolaters, disbelievers)”[al-Nahl 16:123] 
Ibraaheem’s advice to his children was to adhere to the religion of Islam and follow its commands until they died. Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And this (submission to Allaah, Islam) was enjoined by Ibraaheem (Abraham) upon his sons and by Ya‘qoob (Jacob) (saying), ‘O my sons! Allaah has chosen for you the (true) religion, then die not except in the Faith of Islam (as Muslims — Islamic Monotheism)’” [al-Baqarah 2:132] 
O Allaah, send blessings upon Ibraaheem and upon the family of Ibraaheem, for You are Praiseworthy, Most Glorious. 
Other Prophets who were alive at the time of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) were Loot, Ismaa’eel, Ishaaq, and Ya’qoob. Then came Yoosuf, then Shu’ayb, then Ayyoob, then Dhu’l-Kifl. Then Allaah sent Moosa and Haaroon (peace be upon them and may the best of blessings and peace be upon all the Prophets).","From Usool al-Deen al-Islami, by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem al-Tuwayjri"

Is it permissible for him to take this amount or is it too much?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Jibreen (may Allaah preserve him) and he answered as follows: 
If it was a small amount at that time (i.e., the time when the thing was made a waqf), but it has become a lot now, then I think that he should not be given all of that in return for his work. His work may be little, such as supervising and renting out and collecting rents and giving the money to a specific person or to a charitable committee. Based on that, it should be reduced to bring it in line with the salary of others (they should look and see, if another man were to be appointed to do the jobs that this supervisor does, how much would he be paid, then he should be given a similar amount).

He should look at what is customary (al-‘urf) and at the usage of the word ta’mah (feeding the poor) in those days. What was usually meant by it was to offer iftaar and dinner to fasting people, even if it was only three or five poor persons who were in need of iftaar after fasting.

    minor and some are major. The major signs are those which, when the first one appears, the others will follow like beads falling from a broken 
    string. But with regard to the minor signs, there is a long period of time between the first and the last of them. The sending of the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was one of the minor signs of the Hour, not one of the major portents. 
It was narrated that Anas said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) said: “I and the Hour have been sent like these two.” He said, And he held up his index and middle fingers together.

Al-Qurtubi said: 
The first of the portents of the Hours is the Prophet  (peace and blessings of

    Resurrection.

With regard to the strength of Israel (the Jewish state), this is something that 
    has happened to them by the will and decree of Allaah. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Indignity is put over them wherever they may be, except when under a covenant 
    (of protection) from Allaah, and from men”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:112]
Allaah has given them power and respite, but that is only so that when He does 
    seize them, He will seize them severely. 
It was narrated that Abu Moosa (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Allaah gives respite to the wrongdoer until, when He seizes him, He 
    does not let him go.” Then he recited (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Such is the Seizure of your Lord when He seizes the (population of) towns 
    while they are doing wrong. Verily, His Seizure is painful (and) severe”
[Hood 11:102]
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4409; Muslim, 2583. 
At the time of the Mahdi and when ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) comes down, the 
    Muslims’ victory over the Jews will be complete. 
It is proven (in the hadeeth) then when the leader of the Muslims, the Mahdi will 
    come to lead them in praying Fajr, ‘Eesa ibn Maryam will come down to them, and the imam will step back so that ‘Eesa can come forward and lead 
    the prayer, but ‘Eesa will put his hand on his back and say, “Go forward and lead the prayer, for the iqaamah was given for you.” So their imam 
    will lead them in prayer, and when he has finished, then ‘Eesa will head towards the Dajjaal, with whom will be seventy thousand Jews. When the 
    Dajjaal looks at him, he will melt like salt in water, and the Messiah ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) will catch up with him at the gate of Lod (which 
    is a town near Jerusalem) and kill him. Then Allaah will cause the defeat the Jews, and there will be nothing that Allaah has created that a Jew 
    hides behind, but Allaah will cause that thing to speak. Rocks, trees, walls and animals will all say, ‘O Muslim, O slave of Allaah, here is a 
    Jew, come and kill him!’ – except for the box-thorn tree (al-gharqad), for it is one of their trees and will not speak.” 
If the Muslims want to defeat the Jews and all kaafirs, they have to turn back to Allaah and 
    support His religion until Allaah grants them victory, for the Jews are too insignificant for words, but they took advantage of the fact that the 
    Muslims have turned away from their religion. 
We ask Allaah to being the Muslims back to their religion and help them follow it 
    properly.
