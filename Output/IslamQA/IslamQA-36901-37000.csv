The etiquette of du’a","Praise be to Allah.Du’a  is worship 
Allah loves to be asked, and He encourages that in all things. He is angry with the one who does not ask of Him and He encourages His slaves to ask of Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And your Lord said: “Invoke Me [i.e. believe in My Oneness (Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your (invocation).” [Ghafir 40:60] 
Du’a is very important in Islam , so much so that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Du’a is worship.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3372; Abu Dawud, 1479; Ibn Majah, 3828; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 2590) 
The etiquette of du’a 
1. The one who is making du’a should believe in Tawhid with regard to the divinity, Lordship, names and attributes of Allah. His heart should be filled with Tawhid. In order for Allah to respond to the du’a, it is essential that the person should be responding to his Lord by obeying Him and not disobeying Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright.” [al-Baqarah 2:186] 
2. Sincerity towards Allah Alone in making du’a . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him).” [al-Bayyinah 98:5] 
Du’a is worship, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, so sincerity (ikhlas) is a condition of its being accepted. 
3. We should ask of Allah by His most beautiful names . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah, so call on Him by them, and leave the company of those who belie or deny (or utter impious speech against) His Names.” [al-A’raf 7:180] 
4. We should praise Allah as He deserves before we call upon Him. Al-Tirmidhi (3476) narrated that Fadalah ibn ‘Ubayd (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Whilst the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sitting, a man came in and prayed and said, “O Allah, forgive me and have mercy on me.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “You have been too hasty, O worshipper. When you have prayed and are sitting, praise Allah as He deserves to be praised, and send blessings upon me, then call upon Him.” According to another version (3477): “When one of you prays, let him start with praise of Allah, then let him send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), then let him ask whatever he likes after that.” Then another man prayed after that, and he praised Allah and sent blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O worshipper, ask and you will be answered.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 2765, 2767) 
5. Sending blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every du’a is kept back until you send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” Narrated by al-Tabarani in al-Awsat, 1/220; classed as sahهh by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 4399. 
6. Facing towards the qiblah. Muslim (1763) narrated that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: On the day of Badr, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) looked at the mushrikin, who were one thousand strong, and his Companions numbered three hundred and nineteen. Then the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) turned to face the qiblah, then he stretched forth his hands and started to cry out to his Lord: “O Allah, grant me what You have promised me, O Allah, give me what You have promised me. O Allah, if this small band of Muslims perishes, You will not be worshipped on earth.” He kept on crying out to his Lord, stretching forth his hands, facing towards the qiblah, until his cloak fell from his shoulders…  
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim: This shows that it is mustahabb to face towards the qiblah when making du’a, and to raise the hands. 
7. Raising the hands . Abu Dawud (1488) narrated that Salman (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Your Lord, may He be blessed and exalted, is Kind and Most Generous, and He is too kind to let His slave, if he raises his hands to Him, bring them back empty.” Classed as sahih by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 1320. 
The palm of the hand should be raised heavenwards, in the manner of a humble beggar who hopes to be given something. Abu Dawud (1486) narrated from Malik ibn Yasar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When you ask of Allah, ask of Him with the palms of your hands, not with the backs of them.” Classed as sahih by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 1318. 
Should the hands be held together when raising them or should there be a gap between them? 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) stated in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (4/25) that they should be held together. What he said is: “As for separating them and holding them far apart from one another, there is no basis for that in the Sunnah or in the words of the scholars.” End quote. 
8. Having certain faith that Allah will respond, and focusing with proper presence of mind, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Call upon Allah while you are certain of a response, and remember that Allah will not answer a du’a that comes from a negligent and heedless heart.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3479; classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 2766. 
9. Asking frequently. A person should ask his Lord for whatever he wants of the good things in this world and the Hereafter, and he should beseech Allah in du’a, and not seek a hasty response, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The slave will receive a response so long as his du’a does not involve sin or severing of family ties, and so long as he is not hasty.” It was said, “What does being hasty mean?” He said: “When he says, ‘I made du’a and I made du’a, and I have not seen any response,’ and he gets frustrated and stops making du’a.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6340; Muslim, 2735. 
10. He should be firm in his du’a, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one of you should say, ‘O Allah, forgive me if You wish, O Allah, have mercy on me if You wish’; he should be firm in his asking, for Allah cannot be compelled.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6339; Muslim, 2679. 
11. Beseeching, humility, hope and fear. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret.” [al-A'raf 7:55] 
“Verily, they used to hasten to do good deeds, and they used to call on Us with hope and fear, and used to humble themselves before Us.” [al-Anbiya’ 21:90] 
“And remember your Lord within yourself, humbly and with fear and without loudness in words in the mornings and in the afternoons.” [al-A'raf 7:205] 
12. Saying du’as three times. Al-Bukhari (240) and Muslim (1794) narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Whilst the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was praying at the Ka’bah, Abu Jahl and his companions were sitting nearby. They had slaughtered a camel the previous day, and Abu Jahl said: “Which of you will go and get the abdominal contents of the camel of Banu So and So and put it on the back of Muhammad when he prostrates?” The worst of the people went and got it, and when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prostrated, he placed it between his shoulders. They started laughing, leaning against one another. I was standing there watching, and if I had had any power, I would have lifted it from the back of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) remained in prostration, not lifting his head, until someone went and told Fatimah. She came with Juwayriyah, and lifted it from him, then she turned to them and rebuked them. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had finished his prayer, he raised his voice and prayed against them – and when he made du’a or asked of Allah he would repeat it three times – and he said: “O Allah, punish Quraysh” three times. When they heard his voice, they stopped laughing and were afraid because of his du’a. Then he said, “O Allah, punish Abu Jahl ibn Hisham, ‘Utbah ibn Rabi'ah, Shaybah ibn Rabi'ah, al-Walid ibn ‘Uqbah, Umayyah ibn Khalaf and ‘Uqbah ibn Abu Mu’ayt,” and he mentioned the seventh but I cannot remember who it was. By the One Who sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with the truth, I saw those whom he had named slain on the day of Badr, then they were dragged and thrown into the well, the well of Badr. 
13. Ensuring that one’s food and clothing are good (i.e., halal). Muslim (1015) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O people, Allah is Good and does not accept anything but that which is good. Allah enjoins upon the believers the same as He enjoined upon the Messengers. He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘O (you) Messengers! Eat of the Tayyibat [all kinds of Halal (lawful) foods which Allah has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables, fruits)] and do righteous deeds. Verily, I am Well-Acquainted with what you do.’ [al-Muminun 23:51] 
‘O you who believe (in the Oneness of Allah — Islamic Monotheism)! Eat of the lawful things that We have provided you with.’ [al-Baqarah 2:172] 
Then he mentioned a man who travels for a long distance and is disheveled and dusty, and he stretches forth his hands towards heaven saying, ‘O Lord, O Lord,’ but his food is haram, his drink is haram, his clothing is haram, he has been nourished with haram, so how can he be responded to? 
Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Ensuring that one’s food, drink and clothing are halal, and that one is nourished with halal, is a means of having one’s du’a answered. End quote. 
14. Saying du’a silently and not out loud. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret.” [al-A'raf 7:55] 
And Allah praised His slave Zakariyya (peace be upon him) by saying (interpretation of the meaning): 
“When he called to his Lord (Allah) a call in secret.” [Maryam 19:3] 
We have also discussed du’a and specific means by which a person may receive a response, as well as the etiquette of du’a and the times and places when a response may be hoped for, the state in which a person should be when making du’a, impediments to a response to du’a and the types of response. All of that may be found in the answer to question no. 5113 .

36903,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36903,Does Fainting Invalidate Wudu?,Is fainting one of the things that invalidate wudu?,"The scholars agree that fainting is one of the things that invalidate wudu, even if it is brief. Whoever faints and loses consciousness, even for a moment, has broken his wudu.",,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars unanimously agreed that fainting is one of the things that invalidate wudu, even if it is brief. Whoever faints and loses consciousness , even for a moment, has broken his wudu. 
Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni (1/234): 
“Loss of consciousness due to insanity, fainting, drunkenness and medicines that cause loss of consciousness invalidates wudu whether it is brief or long, according to scholarly consensus. Ibn al-Mundhir said: The scholars unanimously agreed that the one who has fainted must do wudu. 
These people lose consciousness more deeply than does one who is asleep, based on the fact that they would not come around if someone tries to rouse them. The fact that wudu is required of one who sleeps indicates that it is required in cases that are more extreme than that.” 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu’ (2/25) 
“The ummah unanimously agreed that wudu is invalidated by insanity and fainting. Consensus on this point was narrated by Ibn al-Mundhir and others, and our companions are unanimously agreed that whoever loses consciousness because of insanity, fainting, sickness, drunkenness, etc, or who takes medicine because of necessity or any other reason and loses consciousness, his wudu is invalidated. 
Our companions said: The drunkenness that invalidates wudu is that in which a person loses consciousness, not the initial feelings of relaxation. And our companions said: there is no differentiation in all these cases between one who is sitting firmly on his backside and one who is not, or whether the amount is a little or a lot."" 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin was asked: Is wudu invalidated by fainting? 
He replied: 
“Yes, wudu is invalidated by fainting, because fainting is more extreme than sleep, and sleep invalidates wudu if it is deep and the sleeper is unaware if anything comes out of him. As for light sleep in which the sleeper would realize if something comes out of him, this kind of sleep does not invalidate wudu, whether the person is lying down, or sitting and reclining, or sitting but not reclining, or in any other position. So long as he realizes if something comes out of him, this sleep does not invalidate wudu. But fainting is more extreme than sleep, so if a person faints, then he has to do wudu .” (Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 11/200) 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on the wudu of those who experience moments of stupor? 
He replied: 
“That depends. If it is brief and the person does not actually lose consciousness and it does not prevent him feeling it if he passes wind , then it does not matter, such as one who feels drowsy but does not sleep deeply, rather he can hear movements. In this case it does not matter because he knows if something comes out of him. The same applies if the stupor does not cause loss of consciousness. But if the stupor prevents him from feeling if something comes out of him, as in the case of drunkenness or one who has a sickness that causes him to lose consciousness to the extent of stupor, then this invalidates his wudu, as in the case of fainting and epilepsy.” (Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 10/145)

36905,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36905,The mas’aa (place of saa’i) is not part of al-Masjid al-Haraam,Is the mas’aa (place of saa’i) part of al-Masjid al-Haraam? Can a menstruating woman approach it? Does a person who enters the mas’aa have to pray tahiyyat al-masjid (two rak’ahs to greet the mosque)?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said:
 “It seems that the Mas’aa is not part of the 
    Mosque, hence they built a wall to separate the two, but it is a low wall. Undoubtedly this is better for people, because if it were to be 
    incorporated into the Mosque and made a part of it, a woman whose period began between tawaaf and saa’i would not be able to do saa’i.
 What I say is that if a woman’s period 
    begins after tawaaf and before saa’i, she should still do saa’i, because the Mas’aa is not considered to be part of the Mosque.
 With regard to tahiyyat al-masjid (greeting 
    the mosque), it may be said that if a person does saa’i after tawaaf and then goes back to the Mosque, then he should pray tahiyyat al-masjid, but

 It is not permissible for a woman who is 
    menstruating or bleeding following childbirth to pray whether in Makkah or in her own land, or in any other place, because the Prophet  (peace

 The Muslims are unanimously agreed that it 
    is not permissible for a menstruating woman to fast and it is not permissible for her to pray. This woman who did this has to repent to Allaah and 
    seek His forgiveness for what she did.  Her tawaaf at the time of her period is not valid, but her saa’i is valid, because the most correct 
    scholarly view is that it is permissible to do saa’i before tawaaf during Hajj. Based on this, she has to repeat the tawaaf, because tawaaf 
    al-ifaadah is one of the pillars or essential parts of Hajj, and the second stage of exiting ihraam cannot be completed without it. Based on this, 
    this woman should not have intercourse with her husband if she is married, until she has done tawaaf; if she is not married then she should not

Dhikr and du`a are highly recommended during the days of tashriq in several ways.","Virtues of the Days of Tashriq


Dhikr during the days of Tashriq","Praise be to Allah.Virtues of the Days of Tashriq
The days of Tashriq are the 11th, 12th and 13th of Dhul-Hijjah . There are several verses and ahadith which speak of their virtue: 

1 – Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And remember Allah during the appointed Days.” [al-Baqarah 2:203]
These are the days of Tashriq. This was the view of Ibn ‘Umar and most of the scholars. 
2 – The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said concerning the days of Tashriq: “They are days of eating, drinking and remembering Allah.” 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade fasting on these days : “Do not fast on these days, for they are the days of eating, drinking and remembering Allah.” Narrated by Ahmad, 10286; classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Sahihah, 3573.
Dhikr during the days of Tashriq
Dhikr (remembering Allah) is enjoined during the days of tashriq in several ways: 

Remembering Allah immediately after the prescribed prayers by reciting Takbir. This is prescribed until the end of the days of Tashriq according to the majority of scholars.
Remembering Him by saying Bismillah and Allahu akbar when slaughtering the sacrificial animal. The time for slaughtering the hadiy and udhiyah lasts until the end of the days of Tashriq.
Remembering Allah when eating and drinking. It is prescribed when eating and drinking to say Bismillah at the beginning, and to praise Him (say Al-hamdu Lillah) at the end. According to the hadith narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Allah likes His slave when he eats something to praise Him for it, and when he drinks something to praise Him for it.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2734)
Remembering Him by saying Takbir when stoning the Jamarat on the days of Tashriq. This applies only to the pilgrims on Hajj.
Remembering Allah in general. It is mustahabb to make a lot of dhikr during the days of Tashriq. ‘Umar used to recite Takbir in Mina in his tent, and when the people heard him they recited Takbir too and Mina echoed with the sound of their Takbir. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“So when you have accomplished your Manasik [rituals of Hajj], remember Allah as you remember your forefathers or with a far more remembrance. But of mankind there are some who say: “Our Lord! Give us (Your Bounties) in this world!” and for such there will be no portion in the Hereafter.
And of them there are some who say: “Our Lord! Give us in this world that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good, and save us from the torment of the Fire!”” [al-Baqarah 2:200-201]
Many of the salaf regarded it as mustahabb to make a lot of du’a during the days of tashriq. 
The words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “These are days of eating, drinking and remembering Allah” indicate that eating and drinking during the days of ‘Eid are means that help one to remember Allah and obey Him; perfect gratitude for the blessing means using it to help one obey and worship Allah, 
In His Book Allah commands us to eat of good things and thank Him for them. So whoever uses Allah’s blessings to commit sin is showing ingratitude for the blessing of Allah, so he deserves to have it taken away from him.

36955,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36955,Ruling on buying cooperative shares for insurance,What is the ruling on buying shares in the cooperative insurance company that is offering shares on the Saudi stock market?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allaah. 
The shar’i ruling on this matter may be summed up as follows: 
1 – The shar’i ruling on insurance
The majority of contemporary scholars are of the view that commercial insurance is haraam and cooperative insurance is permissible. This view was adopted by most of the fatwa-issuing councils, such as the Council of Senior Scholars in Saudi, the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas, the Islamic Fiqh Council of the Muslim World League in Makkah al-Mukarramah, the International Islamic Fiqh Council of the Organization of the Islamic Conference in Jeddah, and others. That is because commercial insurance involves elements of ambiguity, gambling and consuming wealth unlawfully, unlike cooperative insurance which is based on takaaful and tadaamun (mutual support and solidarity). The one who looks objectively at the insurance industry nowadays will realize that this is a moderate and fair-minded approach, and will understand the extent to which it is in accordance with the aims of Islamic sharee’ah of achieving the people’s interests and meeting their needs without being unjust or causing them any harm. Studies of the insurance industry bear witness to that. In a commercial insurance organization, huge amounts of wealth are accumulated by the insurance companies in return for some compensation which may be regarded as very little in comparison to the profits that they make. The result is that only a few rich people benefit the most from the advantages of insurance and its services, whilst the vast majority of poor people are deprived of it because they are unable to afford insurance payments. These companies make people feel that there is no way to spread risk except in this manner. This is something which has been proven false by the experience of cooperative insurance schemes which have been set up in some advanced countries, where it has been more successful in achieving the aims of insurance than the commercial insurance companies. 
2 – The difference between commercial insurance and cooperative insurance
In the case of commercial insurance, the administration of the insurance is carried out by a company which has an identity separate from that of those who are insured by it. This company is entitled to all the instalments paid in return for its commitment to pay out insurance money when it is due (i.e., when an accident or whatever happens). What is left of these instalments is not paid back to those who are insured by the company, because it is considered to be a payment in return for the company’s commitment to pay the compensation as agreed. If all the instalments collected by the company are not enough to pay all the compensation, then the company has no right to go back to the customers and ask them to pay more. This is the essence of the kind of ambiguous transaction that is forbidden in Islam, and is consuming wealth unlawfully. 
In the case of cooperative insurance, a number of people who are exposed to the same type of danger get together and each of them pays a specific contribution. These contributions are for the purpose of paying compensation to anyone who becomes entitled to it as the result of some harm that befell him. If the sum of contributions is greater than the sum paid out in compensation, the members of the scheme are entitled to take back the difference. If there is a shortfall, then the members are asked to make additional contributions to cover the deficit, or else the compensation paid is reduced in accordance with that deficit. 
It does not matter if the cooperative insurance scheme is run by some entity that is separate from those who are covered by the scheme, or that entity takes wages or commission in return for running the scheme. It also does not matter if it takes part of the profits earned by investing that money, in return for acting as their investment agent.  
Thus it is clear that both types of insurance companies may be a separate entity independent of those who are covered by the insurance. In both cases it may be a profitable company – i.e., one which aims to make a profit. The difference between the two types is clear in two basic matters: 
The first difference: in the case of commercial insurance, there is a contractual commitment between the insurance company and those who are covered by it, whereby the company is obliged to pay compensation to the customers, in return for which the company is entitled to all the instalments paid. In the case of cooperative insurance, there is no room for this commitment, because compensation is to be paid from whatever is available of instalments paid. If the instalments are not enough to cover all the compensation, then the members are asked to increase their contributions in order to make up the difference, otherwise compensation will be paid in part, depending on what funds are available. 
The second difference: the cooperative insurance company does not aim to make a profit from the difference between the instalments paid by its customers and the compensation for harm that is paid to them by the company. Rather if the sum of instalments is greater than the sum paid out in compensation for damages, the extra amount is returned to the customers. In contrast, any extra funds in the case of commercial insurance belong entirely to the insurance company in return for its commitment to compensate its customers. 
3 – Ruling on joining cooperative insurance schemes
From studying the financial statements of the National Cooperative Insurance Company (al-Sharikah al-Wataniyyah li’l-Ta’meen al-Ta’aawuni) over the past five years, it is clear that it is not permissible to join this company for the following reasons: 
Firstly: The insurance contract with this company is for commercial insurance, not cooperative. Even though the company was established by separating the fund for instalments paid by shareholders from the financial activities of the insurance company (which has to do administering the funds paid by members of the insurance scheme) – as is the case with cooperative insurance – the system of insurance practised by this company is nothing more or less than commercial insurance, contrary to what its name may indicate. This is clear from the following points: 
(a)The basic system of the company states that if there is any surplus money which represents the difference between instalments paid in and money paid out in compensation, 10% of it is to paid out to those who are covered by the insurance, and the remainder, which is 90% of the net surplus, is to be paid out to the shareholders, because they have taken a risk by investing in this insurance. (Article 43 of the constitution of the company; article 70 of the executive regulations of the watchdog committee on cooperative insurance companies). This means that the insurance system in this company is based on a contractual commitment, whereby the shareholders are entitled to the instalments in return for their commitment to pay compensation. This is the true nature of commercial insurance. Giving back a part of the surplus to the customers is no more than an attempt to give an air of shar’i legitimacy to the contract. But in cooperative insurance, the entire surplus must be given to the customers, either being paid out to them or placed in a contingency fund.
(b)As a result of this rule, the company had surplus funds from its insurance activities, which in 2003 was 178,914,000 riyals, of which 18,000,000 was returned to its customers, i.e., 10% of the surplus. The remaining amount, after taking out some for the contingency fund, was added to the accumulated funds of the company that it has acquired from its insurance activities, the total of which is 548,452,000 riyals. According to the rules of the company, this surplus is regarded as belonging to the shareholders.
(c)This company has contracts for reinsurance with companies that offer this service, which are usually foreign companies that deal on the basis of commercial insurance. It may be noted that reinsurance represents more than half of the insurance payments collected, as is reflected in the following table:

 From this table, it is clear that more than half of the insurance payments are sent outside the Kingdom (Saudi Arabia). This is the nature of commercial insurance. 
Secondly: The company invests in some haraam activities. 
The company has invested the money paid by its customers in haraam stocks and bonds, the value of which in 2003 was 430,525,000 riyals, which is equivalent to 24% of the total insurance activities. 
The company also invested the shareholders’ money in haraam stocks and bonds, the value of which in 2003 reached 34,981,000 riyals, or 8% of the total of the shareholders’ rights. In addition to that, the company owns 50% of one of the commercial insurance companies. 
Suggestions for a cooperative insurance scheme that is in accordance with shar’i guidelines and achieves the aims of insurance: 
(a)The administration of the cooperative insurance should be done by a shared-based company, where the shareholders’ financial affairs are truly independent of the insurance operation.
(b)The share-based company should be allowed to deduct all the administrative and running costs from the total amount of insurance payments collected, and charge fees in return for running the insurance operation as a paid agent. It should also be allowed to invest the money collected from its customers for insurance in permissible investments, for which it will be entitled to a percentage of the profits from those investments because it is acting as an investment partner.
(c)The company should avoid entering into haraam investments such as stocks and bonds, etc., whether that is investing solely for the shareholders or investments that have to do with the insurance operation.
(d)The company’s obligation to pay compensation is of two types: permissible and impermissible. The permissible type means that the company is committed to running its business in an honest and professional manner; if it falls short in that, it should bear responsibility for the consequences and offer compensation for that. As for the type that is impermissible, that means giving an absolute commitment to offer compensation whether the harm is done by the company or by someone else. This goes against the basic principle of cooperative insurance. Instead of that, the company should set up a contingency fund with the money that it has accumulated from insurance payments, and this contingency fund should not be recorded as belonging to the shareholders, rather it belongs exclusively to the insurance operation.
(e)The company may make insurance contracts conditional upon spreading risk, subject to the condition that these contracts are of the cooperative insurance type.
In conclusion, we ask Allaah, may He be blessed and exalted, to enable those who are in charge of this company to do all that is good, and to guide us and them, and all the Muslims, to that which He loves and which pleases Him. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad.
