67576,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67576,Can he avoid attending the funeral of a person who was known to be hard-hearted and cruel?,Can one avoid funeral ceremony of a cruel Person?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Attending a funeral until the prayer has been offered or until the deceased has been buried is a duty that a Muslim owes to his fellow Muslim. Al-Bukhaari (1240) and Muslim (2162) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “The rights of one Muslim over another are five: returning the (greeting of) salam, visiting the sick, attending funerals, accepting invitations and saying ‘Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you)’ to one who sneezes.” 
According to a version narrated by Muslim: “There are five things that a Muslim must do for his brother…” 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said: The apparent meaning is that it is a communal obligation (fard kifaayah). End quote from Fath al-Baari, 3/136. 
So attending funerals is a communal obligation; if some people do it then the rest are absolved of that responsibility, but if none of them do it, then they are all sinners. 
The command to attend funerals is also mentioned in the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (2445) and Muslim (2066) from al-Bara’ ibn ‘Aazib (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us to do seven things and he forbade us to do seven, and he mentioned: “Visiting the sick, attending funerals, saying ‘Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you)’ to one who sneezes, returning the (greeting of) salam, supporting the one who has been wronged, accepting invitations and fulfilling a person’s oath.” 
Concerning the virtue of attending funerals until the prayer has been offered and the deceased has been buried, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever attends the funeral until the prayer has been offered will have one qiraat (of reward) and whoever attends until the deceased has been buried will have two qiraats.” It was said, “What are the two qiraats?” He said: “Like two great mountains.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1325; Muslim, 945. 
However, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did avoid offering the funeral prayer for some people, as a punishment and a rebuke, and so as to deter others from doing what they did. He did not offer the funeral prayer for one who had stolen from the war booty, or for one who had killed himself. 
Muslim (978) narrated that Jaabir ibn Samurah said: A man who had killed himself with an arrow was brought to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but he did not offer the funeral prayer for him. 
Abu Dawood (2710), al-Nasaa’i (1959) and Ibn Maajah (2848) narrated from Zayd ibn Khaalid al-Juhani that one of the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died on the day of Khaybar. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was told about that and he said: “Offer the funeral prayer for your companion.” The people’s expressions changed (i.e. they did not know why the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was not going to lead the funeral prayer himself). He said: “Your companion stole from the war booty (when fighting) for the sake of Allah.” We searched his belongings and found some pearls from the pearls of the Jews that were not even worth two dirhams. 
The scholars understood from this hadeeth that the Sunnah is for the ruler not to offer the funeral prayer for one who stole from the war booty or one who killed himself, following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Here two questions arise: 
1 – Should people of knowledge and virtue follow the ruler’s lead?
2 – Should others who are like the one who stole from the war booty or one who killed himself, or worse than them – such as bandits, oppressors and those who commit major sins or commit sin openly – be treated in like manner? 
The answer is: Yes, people of knowledge and virtue should follow the ruler’s lead, and others who are like the one who stole from the war booty or one who killed himself, or worse than them, should be treated in like manner. 
Al-Baaji said in al-Muntaqa: This is the Sunnah, rulers and people of virtue should refrain from offering the funeral prayer for those who committed major sins, as a deterrent against doing similar actions. The fact that he (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) commanded others to offer the prayer for him indicates that they come under the heading of believers and are not regarded as non-believers because of the sins they committed. End quote. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a person who did not pay zakaah and did not pray except in Ramadaan dies, the people of knowledge and religious commitment should refrain from offering the funeral prayer for him as a punishment and a rebuke to those who are like him, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) refrained from offering the funeral prayer for one who had killed himself, one who had stolen from the war booty, and a debtor who had died without paying off his debt. But some people must offer the funeral prayer for him… If a person who committed sin openly but still had some faith died, like those who commit major sins, and someone refuses to offer the funeral prayer for him as a rebuke to others who are like him, he has done well. If a person offers the funeral prayer for him in the hope that Allah will have mercy on him, and because there is no purpose to be served by refraining from offering the prayer for him, he has also done well. If a person refuses outwardly to offer the funeral prayer for him but makes du’aa’ for him in secret in order to achieve both purposes, that is better than missing out on one of them. End quote. 
Al-Ikhtiyaaraat, p. 80 
In al-Insaaf (2/535), al-Mardaawi narrated that Imam Ahmad did not offer the funeral prayer for those who had committed major sins, and he said: al-Majd (i.e., Majd al-Deen ibn Taymiyah, the grandfather of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah) said that the funeral prayer should not be offered for anyone who had died openly committing sin without having repented. It says in al-Furoo’: and this view is sound. End quote. 
Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If someone were to say: Shouldn’t this ruling apply to the ameer, qaadi or mufti of every town, anyone whose refusal to offer the funeral prayer would be counted as a rebuke? Does the ruling apply to them? The answer is, Yes, it applies to them. If a person’s refusal to offer the funeral prayer will count as a rebuke, then it is Sunnah for him not to offer the funeral prayer for one who has stolen from the war booty or one who killed himself. 
Then he said: Are those who are like the one who steals from the war booty or who kills himself, or who are worse than them and cause more harm to the Muslims, such as bandits, to be treated in like manner? 
Answer: The well-known view in the madhhab is that they are not to be treated in like manner, 
The other view is that the imam should not offer the funeral prayer for those who are like them, or worse than them, because if sharee’ah prescribes a punishment for a certain sin, then it also applies to sins that are similar or worse than that. 
If the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not offer the funeral prayer for the one who stole this insignificant amount from the war booty, then what about one who robs the Muslims on the road, and kills them and takes their wealth? Is he not more deserving of a stern rebuke? 
The answer is, Yes, and that is the correct view: if a sin is equal to these, and the ruler thinks that there is a purpose to be served by not offering the funeral prayer for him, then he should not offer the prayer for him. 
End quote, from al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 5/442. 
Based on the above, if a person was known to be hard-hearted and cruel in the sense that he committed major sins or committed sin openly, then the people of knowledge and virtue, whose refusal will have the effect of deterring others from committing similar sins and will put people off these sins and those who commit them, should refrain from offering the funeral prayer for him. But ordinary people, whose refusal to attend the funeral and offer the prayer will not have any impact, should attend the funeral and offer the prayer, so that they may attain the reward for that and fulfil their duty towards their fellow-Muslim.

67578,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67578,Ruling on delaying zakaah and investing the wealth,"The annual zakaah on my wealth is a considerable amount (such as 10,000 Egyptian pounds). Previously I have usually given it to the poor or to build a hospital for the poor, etc, but now I am thinking of keeping the value of this zakaah for three or four years in a separate account that brings a suitable annual return in one of the Islamic banks, with the aim of generating a sum that will be suitable for establishing a non-profit centre for da’wah and education using the most modern methods of research and studying in this field for Muslims who begin to have doubts about their religion when they compare it with other religions. Then my annual zakaah will be given to this centre. This is in addition to donations that we hope will be given by other Muslims.

 Is this permissible according to sharee’ah?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    We would like to thank you for your protective jealousy 
    concerning your religion and for your concern about the Muslims’ situation, 
    but what you want to do and are asking about is not in accordance with 
    sharee’ah, because when zakaah becomes due, after one year has passed, it 
    must be paid immediately, and it is not permissible to delay it if one is 
    able to pay it. 

    Zakaah is an act of worship and the Muslim must adhere to the 
    rulings on the amount on which zakaah is to be paid, when it is to be paid 
    and the types of wealth on which it must be paid; he does not have the right 
    to delay paying it once the time comes, unless he has an excuse which allows 
    that. 

    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: 

    If zakaah is due in Jumaada al-Oola, can we delay it until 
    Ramadaan with no excuse? 

    They replied: 

    It is not permissible to delay paying zakaah after one year 
    has been completed unless there is a legitimate shar’i excuse, such as there 
    being no poor people around at the time when the year is complete, or not 
    being able to get it to them, or because the money is not accessible, etc. 
As for delaying it 
    because of Ramadaan, that is not permissible unless it is only a short 
    period away, such as if the end of the year comes in the second half of 
    Sha’baan; in that case there is nothing wrong with delaying it until 
    Ramadaan. End quote. 

    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah 
    wa’l-Ifta’, 9/398 

    It is not permissible to do business with zakaah wealth for 
    one who is obliged to pay zakaah, or for the institution that takes the 
    zakaah wealth and is entrusted with making sure it reaches the people who 
    are entitled to it. Rather it is obligatory to give it (in the manner 
    prescribed), and their investments should be made with wealth other than 
    zakaah. 

    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked about a 
    charitable organization that wanted to invest its wealth.  They replied: 
If the money mentioned 
    in the question comes from zakaah, then it must be given to the people who 
    are entitled to it according to sharee’ah when it reaches the charitable 
    organization. But if it is not zakaah, then there is no reason why it should 
    not be used for trade in the interests of the organization, because that 
    will increase the benefits that the charity aims to achieve.  End quote. 

    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth il-‘Ilmiyyah 
    wa’l-Ifta’, 9/403, 404 

    They were also asked: 

    Can a global Islamic charity invest zakaah money that has 
    been placed in bank accounts until they are able to distribute it, when 
    investing it is not going to affect the way it is spent according to 
    sharee’ah, on condition that the investments be made in such a way that it 
    may be accessed easily in case of need, and in investments that have been 
    well studied and are reliable, but we do not say that they are guaranteed so 
    as to avoid anything haraam or doubtful, and on the basis that the charity 
    is not a person or persons representing themselves, rather it is a separate 
    entity, and the people in it are working and doing their best to find out 
    what is best for Islam and the Muslims? 

    They replied: 
It is not permissible 
    for the charity to invest the zakaah money. What should be done is to spend 
    it in the ways prescribed in sharee’ah, after ensuring that the people 
    concerned are entitled to it, because the aim of zakaah is to meet the needs 
    of the poor and pay off the debts of those who are in debt, whereas 
    investment may cause these benefits to be lost or may delay them a great 
    deal for those who are entitled to them. End quote. 

    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth il-‘Ilmiyyah 
    wa’l-Ifta’, 9/454, 455 

    Secondly: 

    With regard to giving zakaah to build a hospital for the poor 
    or some other charitable projects, we have stated in the answer to question 
    no. 39211 that zakaah is to be 
    spent on certain categories as prescribed in sharee’ah. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “As-Sadaqaat (here it means Zakaah) are only for the 
    Fuqaraa’ (poor), and Al‑Masaakeen(the poor) and those 
    employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have 
    been inclined (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in 
    debt; and for Allaah’s Cause (i.e. for Mujaahidoon — those fighting in a 
    holy battle), and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from 
    everything); a duty imposed by Allaah. And Allaah is All-Knower, All-Wise”

    [al-Tawbah 9:60]

    So 
    it is not permissible to give zakaah to any categories other than these.

    You 
    have to pay zakaah on time; it is not permissible to delay it when you are 
    able to pay it, or to invest that money, whether in profitable business 
    projects or in da’wah projects.

    With 
    regard to the da’wah project of which you are thinking, you should try to 
    persuade whoever you can of the Muslims to finance it without using zakaah 
    funds.

    May 
    Allaah help us to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.

67586,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67586,Reading Quran with an accent in which some letters such as tha’ and dhal are altered,"Is it permissible to read Quran in the manner of some non-Arab people who pronounce letters such as tha’ as if it is seen, and dhal as if it is za’ and so on?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is obligatory to read Quran with the letters with which Allah has revealed it, with sound Arabic pronunciation, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And truly, this (the Quran) is a revelation from the Lord of the ‘Aalameen(mankind, jinn and all that exists),
193. Which the trustworthy Rooh [Jibreel (Gabriel)] has brought down
194. Upon your heart (O Muhammad) that you may be (one) of the warners,
195. In the plain Arabic language” [al-Shu’ara 26:192-195] 
“Verily, We have sent it down as an Arabic Quran in order that you may understand” [Yoosuf 12:2]
It is not permissible for anyone to deliberately change any letter of it when he is able to pronounce it correctly. This is a kind of mistake which is a sin. 
If a person finds it difficult to pronounce the letters correctly – such as people in whose language some of the Arabic letters, such as tha’, dhal and kha’ do not exist – they have to try to learn the correct pronunciation, but if they are unable to master it then they are excused, but their example should not be followed, and they should be called upon to strive their hardest to learn and correct their pronunciation. And none of them should lead the prayer, unless he is leading others like him who cannot pronounce well either. 
Ibn al-Jazari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whoever is able to read the words of Allah with correct Arabic pronunciation but he deliberately pronounces it incorrectly like a non-Arab, out of arrogance, stubbornness and complacency, or because he is too proud to go to a scholar who could help him to correct his pronunciation, is undoubtedly falling short and sinning and being dishonest. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Religion is sincerity: to Allah, to His Book, to His Messenger, and to the leaders of the Muslims and their common folk.” 
But if a person’s tongue will not obey him or he cannot find someone to teach him the correct pronunciation, then Allah does not burden any soul beyond its scope. 
End quote from al-Nashr fi’l-Qiraa’aat al-‘Ashr, 1/299 
It should be noted that Allah has made it easy to memorize and recite Quran, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We have indeed made the Quran easy to understand and remember; then is there any one who will remember (or receive admonition)?” [al-Qamar 54:17]
Hence we see many of our brothers in the countries referred to who are able to pronounce the letters perfectly, better than many of their Arab brothers. So you should strive to learn the correct pronunciation and recite Quran with proper Tajweed, and not despair or give up.

    Marriage is one of the means of obtaining provision, as 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who 
    has no wife and the woman who has no husband) and (also marry) the Saalihoon 
    (pious, fit and capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid‑servants 
    (female slaves). If they be poor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty. 
    And Allaah is All‑Sufficient for His creatures’ needs, All‑Knowing (about 
    the state of the people)”

    [al-Noor 24:32]

    al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “those 
    among you who are single” refers to those who have no spouse, men and 
    women. 

    And he said: “If they be poor, Allaah will enrich them out 
    of His Bounty” means: do not refrain from getting married because the 
    man or the woman is poor. If they are poor, Allaah will make them 
    independent of means by His bounty. This is a promise of independence of 
    means to those who get married, seeking the pleasure of Allaah and seeking 
    to protect themselves from sin. Ibn Mas’ood said: Seek independence of means 
    through marriage, and he recited this verse. ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) said: I am surprised by those who do not seek independence of 
    means through marriage, when Allaah has said, “If they be poor, Allaah 
    will enrich them out of His Bounty.” Something similar was also narrated 
    from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him). 

    Al-Qurtubi also said: This verse indicates that the poor man 
    should get married, and he should not say, How can I get married when I have 
    no wealth? For his provision comes from Allaah. The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave in marriage a woman who came to offer 
    herself to him, to a man who hadnothing but a single izaar (waist-wrapper). 
    End quote from Tafseer al-Qurtubi (12/218). 

    And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “There are three who are all entitled to Allaah’s help: the one who fights 
    for the sake of Allaah; the mukaatab who wants to pay (the price of his 
    freedom); and the one who gets married seeking chastity.” Narrated by 
    al-Tirmidhi (1579), al-Nasaa'i (3166) and Ibn Maajah (2509). This hadeeth 
    was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 

    If this young man is going to do the marriage contract, and 
    his wife is going to stay in her father’s house until they can afford to set 
    up home together, there is nothing wrong with that. But he has to look for 
    work so that he can spend on himself, his wife and his house, so that his 
    wife and her family will not be adversely affected if it takes too long. 

    If what is meant is that his wife will move to his house but 
    they have agreed not to be intimate, so that they will not have children at 
    this stage, that is not appropriate for several reasons: 

    1-Refraining from intimacy means 
    missing out on something that is one of the most important aims of marriage, 
    which is having children.

    2-Refraining from having children 
    for fear of poverty is contrary to putting one’s trust in Allaah, and it is 
    an imitation of the people of Jaahiliyyah who used to kill their children 
    for fear of poverty. Allaah has guaranteed to give provision for every soul, 
    as He says (interpretation of the meaning):

    “And no moving (living) creature is there on earth but its 
    provision is due from Allaah. And He knows its dwelling place and its 
    deposit (in the uterus or grave). All is in a Clear Book (Al‑Lauh Al‑Mahfûz 
    — the Book of Decrees with Allaah)”

    [Hood 11:6] 

    “And in the heaven is your provision, and that which you 
    are promised”

    [al-Dhaariyaat 51:22]

    But we must point out two things: 

    1 – With regard to marriage, it is essential that the 
    conditions be fulfilled, which is the consent of both parties and that there 
    be no legal impediments such as their being mahrams (relatives to whom 
    marriage is forbidden) or their being related through breastfeeding. The 
    woman’s wali (guardian) and two witnesses must also be present, otherwise 
    the marriage is not valid. 

    2 – It is not permissible for a man and woman to form a 
    relationship before marriage, because of the many negative consequences to 
    which that will lead, such as falling in love, sickness of the heart 
    (because of sin), looking at one another, being alone together, speaking 
    softly to one another and other things that Allaah has forbidden.

67594,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67594,He bought some land and he is waiting for its price to rise before selling it. Does he have to pay zakaah on it?,"Because of the high prices of land and houses and because these prices may reach an astronomical level, to such an extent that most people cannot buy a house to live in, I would like to do the following: I want to buy two pieces of land now for a low price (such as 30,000 riyals for one), and wait for 10 or 20 years until it is worth 500,000 riyals for example, then I will sell one piece of land and use that money to build a house on the other piece. My question is, how can I calculate the zakaah on each one? Because one is for building a house, but the other is what I am confused about because it may be regarded as wealth kept for trading. I do not want it for its own sake, rather I want to benefit from the rise in prices in order to build a house. 

I have heard some fatwas which say that zakaah may be paid once for the twenty years, and I have heard others saying that zakaah must be paid for each of the 20 years, based on the estimated value.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It is not obligatory to pay zakaah on land unless it is for 
    the purpose of trade. Based on this, the land on which you are going to 
    build a house is not subject to zakaah, but the other piece of land is 
    subject to zakaah. 

    The way in which zakaah is worked out is to find out the 
    value of the land at the end of each year, then pay zakaah at a rate of 2.5% 
    of this value. 

    Zakaah must be paid each year; it is not sufficient to pay it 
    one year for all these years. It should be noted that if trade goods are 
    bought with gold or silver, or with money (riyaals or dollars or other 
    currencies), or with other goods, then the year is reckoned from the time 
    when the wealth with which it was bought was acquired. Based on this, the 
    year does not begin from the time when you took possession of the land; 
    rather it begins from the time when you bought the land.   

    See question no. 32715. 

    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: 

    I have some money – say, fifty thousand, with which I have 
    bought some land. I think that instead of keeping it in the bank, I should 
    invest it in land so that I will not lose the money. When the right time 
    comes or when I need the money, I will sell the land when its value has 
    increased. Is zakaah due on it? 

    They replied: 

    Whoever buys land or is given it and intends to sell it, must 
    pay zakaah on it when a full year has passed. He must estimate its value 
    every year at the time when zakaah becomes due, and pay zakaah at a rate of 
    one-quarter of one-tenth, i.e., 2.5%. 

    If he buys it with the intention of settling on it and living 
    there, then no zakaah is due on it. But if he then decides to sell it, he 
    must pay zakaah on it after one year has passed since he decided to sell it. 
    If he buys it in order to rent it out, then he must pay zakaah on the rent 
    he receives if it reaches the nisaab, after one year has passed.  

    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah 
    wa’l-Ifta’, 9/339, 340 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: How should zakaah be paid on land and 
    the like? Is it sufficient to pay zakaah on it once for a number of years 
    when it is sold? 

    He replied: 

    If the land and similar things such as a house or car etc, is 
    prepared for sale, then you must pay zakaah on it every year, according to 
    its value at the end of the year. It is not permissible to delay that, 
    except in the case of one who is unable to pay the zakaah because he does 
    not have any other wealth. In this case he may wait until he sells it and 
    then pay zakaah for all the years, paying for each year on the basis of its 
    value at the end of the year, whether it was worth more or less than the 
    price for which he bought the land, car or house. 
This is the view of the 
    majority of scholars, because it was narrated that the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded that zakaah be paid on things 
    that are prepared for sale, and because trade goods are kept for the purpose 
    of making money. So the Muslim has to pay zakaah on these goods every year, 
    just as if he had money in his hand. End quote.
