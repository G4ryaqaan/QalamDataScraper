I left them with my mother for safekeeping, because the laws of my country do not allow me to take gold out of the country, and I used to wear them all the time. Now I live in another country. Should I pay zakaah on them?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.In question
    19901 we quoted a fatwa from the Standing Committee on the zakaah of jewellery that is 
    made to be worn. They said that the more correct of the two scholarly opinions is that jewellery that is made to be worn is subject to zakaah. It 
    should be noted that it is the fact that the gold is made to be worn that makes it subject to zakaah; it does not have to be worn all the time. 
Based on this, the fact that the gold has 
    been left with your mother for safekeeping does not alter the fact that it has been made to be worn, and that it belongs to you, so you have to 
    pay zakaah on it because it reaches the nisaab or threshold above which zakaah is due, because the nisaab for gold is 85 grams. See question no.
    2795 and 64. 
Based on this, this gold is subject to zakaah 
    which you should pay each year, at a rate of 2.5 percent of its value.

So what is better – should I complete my obligatory prayer with the imam or should I regard that as Sunnah and pray with the other jamaa’ah?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is better for you to join the imam and then complete what you missed, because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Whatever you catch up with, pray, and whatever you have missed, make it up.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 635; Muslim, 602. 
The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas received two questions similar to yours. There follows the text of the two questions and their answers. 
Question: Once I went to the mosque to pray ‘Asr and I found the worshippers had done three rak’ahs and they had started the last one and were prostrating. Should I join them or wait until they have finished? 
Answer:  What is prescribed in a situation like this is to join them. Whatever you catch up with, pray with them, and whatever you have missed, make it up. If you join them after they have stood up from rukoo’ in the last rak’ah, then join them and complete the whole prayer after the imam says the tasleem. This is because of the hadeeth narrated by Abu Dawood (may Allah have mercy on him) (893), that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If you come to prayer and we are prostrating, then prostrate but do not count it as anything. Whoever catches up with one rak’ah has caught up with the prayer.” And because of the general meaning of the hadeeth narrated by the two Shaykhs al-Bukhari and Muslim (may Allah have mercy on them) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When you come to the prayer do not rush. You should be calm and dignified. Whatever you catch up with, pray, and whatever you miss, make up.” 
And Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions. 
Question:  If a person catches up with the final tashahhud before the imam says the tasleem, is he regarded as having caught up with the virtue of praying in congregation (jamaa’ah), or will he have the reward of one who prays alone? What is better if he enters the mosque when the imam is reciting the final tashahhud – should he complete the tashahhud or is it better to wait for some others to come and pray with them? 
Answer: The person who catches up with the imam in the final tashahhud is not regarded as having caught up with the jamaa’ah, but he will have a reward commensurate with however much of the prayer he caught up with the imam in. Rather the one who is regarded as having caught up with the jamaa’ah is the one who catches up with at least one rak’ah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever catches up with one rak’ah of the prayer has caught up with the prayer.” It is better for him to join the imam, because of the general meaning of the hadeeth: “Whatever you catch up with, pray, and whatever you miss, make up.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 635; Muslim, 602.  And Allah is the Source of strength.

31064,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/31064,Ruling on greeting with a wave of the hand,What is the ruling on greeting with a wave of the hand?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to greet with a wave of the hand, rather the Sunnah is to greet and 
    return the greeting with words. Greeting with a wave of the hand is not permissible, because it is an imitation of some of the kuffaar who do 
    that, and because it is contrary to what is prescribed by Allaah. But if a person gestures to the one whom he is greeting to indicate that he is 
    saying salaam, because he is far away, whilst also uttering the words of the greeting, there is nothing wrong with that, because there is evidence 
    to that effect. Similarly, if the person who is greeted is busy praying, he may respond with a gesture, as was narrated in the saheeh Sunnah of 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li’l-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 6/352"
31069,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/31069,Was the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) born circumcised?,Was the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) born circumcised or was he circumcised like other people?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) mentioned three opinions concerning the circumcision of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He said: 
There are different opinions on this matter: 
1 – That he was born circumcised 
2 – That Jibreel circumcised him when he split open his chest 
3 – That his grandfather ‘Abd al-Muttaalib circumcised him according to the Arab custom of circumcising their sons. 
Tuhfat al-Mawlood, p. 201. 
With regard to the first opinion, Ibn al-Qayyim narrated many ahaadeeth in the book mentioned which indicate this, but he ruled all of them to be da’eef (weak). Then he mentioned that if a child is born circumcised, this is a defect and it is a not a sign of virtue as some people think. 
And he said: 
It was said that Caesar the king of Rome whom Imru’ul-Qays came to visit was born like that (i.e., uncircumcised) and Imru’ul-Qays entered upon him in the baths and saw him like that, and composed a line of verse mocking him for being uncircumcised: 
He scorned him because he was not circumcised, and he regarded his being born like that as a defect. This line of verse was one of the reasons that motivated Caesar to poison Imru’ul-Qays and he died. 
The Arabs used to think of the act of circumcision as being something virtuous, but not the feature itself.  
Ibn al-Qayyim said: Allaah sent our Prophet from amongst the Arabs, and He gave him attributes of physical perfection and made him of fine lineage. So how could it be possible that he was born circumcised? It was said that circumcision was one of the words with which Allaah tested His Close Friend Ibraaheem, and he fulfilled this word, and the most severely tested of mankind are the Prophets, then the next best and the next best. The Prophet listed circumcision as one of the features of the fitrah, and being tested with this and carrying out this command with patience will multiply the reward. It is more befitting that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) should not miss out on this virtue and that Allaah should honour him in the same way as He honoured Ibraaheem, because he is more virtuous than any other Prophet. 
Tuhfat al-Mawlood, 205-206 
With regard to the second opinion, he said: 
The hadeeth about the angel splitting open his heart was narrated through many isnaads going back to the Prophet; it does not mention in any of them that Jibreel circumcised him, except in this hadeeth which is (shaadhdh ghareeb (odd and strange). 
Tuhfat al-Mawlood, p. 206 
With regard to the third opinion, he said: 
Ibn al-‘Adeem said: It says in some reports that his grandfather ‘Abd al-Muttalib circumcised him on the seventh day. He said, this seems to be the correct view and closest to reality.  
Tuhfat al-Mawlood, p. 206 
Ibn al-Qayyim said in Zaad al-Ma’aad (1/82): 
This issue arose between two righteous men. One of them wrote a book saying that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was born circumcised and compiled in it ahaadeeth which are not sound at all. His name was Kamaal al-Deen ibn Talhah. He was criticized by Kamaal al-Deen ibn al-‘Adeem who explained that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was circumcised according to the custom of the Arabs. As this was the custom of all of the Arabs, there is no need for a report (to prove that he was circumcised).

31072,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/31072,Studying in a society that does not adhere to Islamic sharee’ah,"I am a young Muslim man. I worship Allaah and I want to act in accordance with the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). But the problem is that I live among people most of whom do not pray or fast or pay zakaah. They engage in bid’ah and innovated matters, they swear by things other than Allaah and make vows to others than Allaah. Some people express disbelief (kufr) in Allaah and His Messenger in their words. I am a youth studying in middle school, and most of the students are bad mannered and do not obey the commands of Allaah. There are girls with us who do not wear hijaab, and the female teachers are the same, so that it is too easy to commit evil and haraam actions, and other things that would take too long to explain. But my father will not let me leave school. I want to leave this school and get away from this environment, and work in farming and worship Allaah far away from the evil of people, but my father will not let me do that. I want to ask whether it is permissible for me to leave school. Is it permissible for me to leave this country and move to another, even if my father does not approve? Please advise me, may Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If the situation is as you describe, then you must leave this school and beware of its evil, 
    and keep away from it and its people, in order to protect your religious commitment, belief and morals from these evildoers among the students, 
    male and female, and this bad society. You must do your utmost to move to a safe school or a safe city or a farm or whatever is farthest removed 
    from danger to your religious commitment and morals. This is what you must do, even if your father does not approve, because the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Obedience is only with regard to that which is right and proper.” And he  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) also said, “There is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator.” Sitting 
    among evildoers, people of shirk and those who do not pray, and sitting among girls who make a wanton display of their beauty and are unveiled 
    poses a serious danger to one's beliefs and morals, so it is not permissible for the Muslim to remain in this situation. Rather he must beware of 
    this society and move away from it to a society that is better and safer for his religious commitment even if he has to travel from one city to 
    another, such as going to Makkah or Madeenah in order to study in al-Masjid al-Haraam or al-Masjid al-Nabawi, because there are teachers there who 
    are people of knowledge, virtue and sound ‘aqeedah, whether his parents approve or not, because obedience to parents is only with regard to that 
    which is right and proper, not in matters of sin and disobedience, as stated above. And Allaah is the One Whose help we seek.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li’l-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 6/344"
