65903,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65903,She bled after having a coil inserted after her nifaas ended,"My postnatal bleeding has stopped ten days before Ramadan started. I visited the doctor and she inserted coil two days before Ramadan. I started bleeding again till this day, should I fast and pray? Bear in mind that I am fasting and praying currently.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The basic principle is that the bleeding experienced by women is menstrual blood, so long as it does not last for more than fifteen days, in which case it is istihaadah (non-menstrual bleeding) according to the majority of fuqaha’. According to some scholars, it is menstrual blood unless it continues for most of the month; if it does that, then it becomes istihaadah. 
Secondly: 
The menses may be longer or shorter, or it may come early or late. The blood that comes in these cases is regarded as menstrual blood, and there is no need to repeat the fast, according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions. So your usual period may be seven days, then it increases to ten for example, so the ruling is that it is all menses. 
Thirdly: 
Having a coil inserted usually causes some disruption of the cycle, such as making the period longer, or making it come earlier, or changing the nature of the blood. 
Fourthly: 
What we understand from your question is that the bleeding started after the coil was inserted, two days before Ramadaan, and it has lasted until today (the seventh of Ramadaan), but you did not tell us what your previous cycle was like, or whether the period came at the usual time or not. 
Based on this information, the bleeding you are experiencing comes under the heading of menstrual blood, unless it lasts for more than fifteen days, in which case you will be mustahaadah (experiencing istihaadah or non-menstrual bleeding). [According to some scholars, you will not be mustahaadah unless the bleeding lasts for most of a month.] 
If it is established that you are mustahaadah, then one of three scenarios must apply: 
1-
You previously had a regular cycle, so you should count on your former cycle and refrain from prayer etc. accordingly, then do ghusl and pray. Any bleeding outside of your normal period is istihaadah. 
2-
If you did not previously have a regular cycle, then you have to distinguish between types of bleeding: menstrual blood is dark and thick, and has an unpleasant odour, and is usually accompanied by pains (cramps). The blood of istihaadah is light and thin. So your menses is the days when the blood is dark and thick, and the other blood is istihaadah. 
3-
If you cannot make this distinction, then you should refrain from praying for six or seven days, because that is the usual length of women’s menses, then do ghusl and pray. 
The woman who is mustahaadah may fast, pray and have intercourse, but she must do wudoo’ for every obligatory prayer after the time for it begins, and she may offer whatever naafil prayers she wants to with that wudoo’. 
Cases of istihaadah, with evidence, have been discussed in the answer to question no. 68818.

65915,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65915,The first prayer in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) bowed,"This is my first time to visit this site, and having looked through it, I think it is a brilliant and useful site full of information and answers. 
My question is: 
What was the first prayer in which the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) bowed (rukoo’)?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
We are very happy to learn of your visit to our site and that you have benefited from it; we hope that you will continue to benefit. 
Secondly: 
Some of the scholars have stated that the first prayer in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) bowed was ‘Asr prayer following the Isra’ and Mi’raaj (the Prophet’s Night Journey and Ascent into heaven).
 Al-Ramli al-Shaafa’i said in Nihaayat al-Muhtaaj (1/396): 
Bowing is one of the unique characteristics of this ummah. The first prayer in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) bowed was ‘Asr prayer on the day after the Isra’. Al-Suyooti quoted as evidence for that the fact that it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed Zuhr on that day without bowing, and that before that he had prayed that night in like manner. Were it not that bowing is one of the unique characteristics of this ummah, he would have done it in the prayers that he offered before the Isra’ and in Zuhr prayer of the day after. 
There is a hadeeth concerning that which was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but there is some weakness in it. 
Al-Bazzaar and al-Tabaraani (in al-Awsat) narrated that ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The first prayer in which we bowed was ‘Asr. I said: “O Messenger of Allah, what is this?” He said: “I was commanded to do it.” 
Al-Haythami said in Majma’ al-Zawaa’id (1/293): 
This was narrated by al-Bazzaar and by al-Tabaraani in al-Awsat, but its isnaad includes Abu ‘Abd al-Raheem – if he is Khaalid ibn Yazeed, then he is thiqah (trustworthy) and is one of the men of saheeh, and I did not find any other Abu ‘Abd al-Raheem in the men of books apart from him, and I did not find Abu ‘Abd al-Raheem in al-Meezaan, and he is majhool (unknown). 
The hadeeth is mentioned in Kanz al-‘Ummaal (21779), where it is suggested that it is weak.

Praise be to Allaah, I fulfil my duties towards them in the fullest sense. I am a religiously committed person; I pray regularly and recite dhikr and du’aa’, and I work in this life for the sake of my children. But hard feelings are always coming to me. I feel desperately lonely and I also feel stressed and depressed. I am also a person who would like to enjoy life within the limits of what Allaah loves and is pleased with. I feel that I strongly need to get married because I have started to feel fed up and I am getting worked up about everything in life, even insignificant things. I feel as if I am in a locked room in which I am the only person, and I feel depressed. Everyone who sees me, whether at work or during social visits, tells me that they can see signs of depression on my face. In addition to that I feel that I need to live life and not be like an object left in one corner of life. I do not want these feelings to take over me  because they have started to have a direct impact on my work, and on my relationships with family, relatives and friends. I always keep quiet and am always withdrawn from people so that they will not see signs of depression on my face. I am not able to put a smile on my face; I regard it as something that is too difficult for me. I am in a vicious circle that has no end: divorce, my children, my need for a husband and stability. I feel that I do not want to live, and I know that that is wrong, but humans are composed of feelings and reason. I am a woman and I do not know if I have the right to speak of this subject or not. I am very tired of life, I go anywhere and I sit in gatherings with family, relatives and friends but I am always thinking of this matter… I want to live my life in a natural fashion, but I do not know what to do.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      We ask Allaah to bless you with tranquility and peace of 
      mind, and to take away the stress and worry that you are experiencing, and 
      to grant you the means of goodness and success.

     We do not think that what you have mentioned of tiredness 
    and pain is experienced by everyone who goes through what you have gone 
    through. But at the least there is a measure of stress that a woman goes 
    through when she loses her husband and has to start dealing directly with 
    the burdens of life.  Moreover, women vary in their ability to put up with 
    things and try to overcome them. There are many divorced woman who have been 
    able to overcome these problems, and live happy and contented lives. This 
    depends on certain reasons which may be the solution in your case, in sha 
    Allah. There follow some of them, for you to ponder and try to put into 
    practice, so that you can regain the happiness that you have lost. 

    1 – Developing a strong relationship with Allaah. That 
    includes believing that this problem and others happen by the will and 
    decree of Allaah and that Allaah is more compassionate and merciful towards 
    you than a mother towards her child, and that His decree is good for His 
    slave, both in the short and long term. Calamities expiate sin, bearing them 
    with patience raises one in status, and when Allaah loves His slave He tests 
    him. 
2 – You have two choices: 
    either you can live feeling miserable, worried and anxious, or you can bear 
    it with patience and seek reward, in the hope of attaining reward and rising 
    in status. Your sorrow will neither advance you nor put you back, as the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The greatest 
    reward comes with the greatest trial. When Allaah loves a people He tests 
    them. Whoever accepts that wins His pleasure but whoever is discontent with 
    that earns His wrath.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2396; Ibn Maajah, 4031; 
    classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
3 – Pondering the 
    blessings of Allaah, and striving to show gratitude for them, and comparing 
    these many blessings with the calamity that befell you. This opens the heart 
    to contentment. So think of how many blessings Allaah has bestowed upon you, 
    in your religion, your self, your health, your wealth and your children. 
    Think of the calamities that have befallen others. How many women are 
    paralyzed, how many suffer calamities that befall their children, or are 
    tested in their religious commitment, or suffer sickness, and so on. If you 
    think about this you will find that you are enjoying blessings for which you 
    are to be envied. You will realize that there are people who are suffering 
    greater calamities than you. This should make things easier for you and make 
    you give praise and thanks, and acknowledge the bounty and mercy of Allaah. 

    4 – Thinking about the calamity that has befallen you, and 
    seeing the blessings that may be hidden therein. How many married women 
    suffer from harsh treatment and abuse from their husbands and live a 
    miserable life with them. You have been spared all that, so give praise to 
    Allaah. 

    5 – Filling your time with things that will bring benefit in 
    this world and in the Hereafter. For example, you could join a centre that 
    teaches memorization of the Holy Qur’aan, attend religious lectures, read 
    useful books, learn useful domestic skills such as sewing, and so on. 

    6 – Paying attention to the ultimate goal, which is to earn 
    the pleasure of Allaah and attain His Paradise and be saved from the Fire. 
    This requires buckling down to hard work and serious effort. That is the 
    basis of true success and true happiness in life. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And whoever is removed away from the Fire and admitted to 
    Paradise, he indeed is successful. The life of this world is only the 
    enjoyment of deception (a deceiving thing)”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:185]
7 – Having certain faith 
    that what is with Allaah is better for you; that He is the Most Merciful of 
    those who show mercy; that He is with the pious (those who fear Him) and 
    loves those who do good; He rewards those who are patient and helps the 
    believers, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Whoever works righteousness — whether male or female — 
    while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him 
    We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful 
    provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the 
    best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter)”

    [al-Nahl 16:97]
Beware of complaining 
    about Him to His creation, because you are complaining about the One who has 
    mercy to one who has no mercy. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever is struck by poverty and he goes around 
    telling people about it (and complaining about it in the hope of receiving 
    help), then his calamity will not be relieved. Whoever is struck by poverty 
    and he complains to Allaah about it, Allaah will grant him relief sooner or 
    later.” 

    Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2326; Abu Dawood, 1645; classed as 
    saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 

    8 – Frequently recite this du’aa’ which was narrated from the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): 

    It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “If a person who is afflicted by anxiety or sorrow 
    says: ‘Allaahumma inni ‘abduka wa ibnu ‘abdika wa ibn ammatika naasiyati 
    bi yadika maadin fiyya hukmuka ‘adlun fiyya qadaa’uka as’aluka bi kulli 
    ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw ‘allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw 
    anzaltahu fi kitaabika aw asta’tharta bihi fi ‘ilm il-ghaybi ‘indaka an 
    taj’al al-Qur’aana rabee’a qalbi wa noora sadri wa jalaa’a huzni wa dhahaaba 
    hammi (O Allaah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave, son of Your female 
    slave, my forelock is in Your hand, Your command over me is forever executed 
    and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You 
    with which You have named Yourself, or, or You have taught to any of Your 
    creation, or You have revealed in Your Book, or You have preserved in the 
    knowledge of the Unseen with You, that You make the Qur’aan the life of my 
    heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a 
    release for my anxiety)’, then Allaah will take away his anxiety and sorrow, 
    and will replace it with joy.”  

    It was said: “O Messenger of Allaah, should we not learn it?” 
    He said: “Yes, whoever hears it should learn it.” 

    Narrated by Ahmad; classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in
    al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 199 

    We ask Allaah to relieve you of your anxiety and replace it

In obligatory prayers, it is disliked to read from the Mus-haf, but if there is a need, then there is nothing wrong with reading from the Mus-haf.","Reading from the Mus-haf in Sunnah prayers


Does reading from the Mus-haf invalidate the prayer?


Reading from the Mus-haf in obligatory prayer","Praise be to Allah.Reading from the Mus-haf in Sunnah prayers
There is nothing wrong with reading Quran from the Mus-haf during an optional prayer, such as Qiyam Al-layl . 
But in the case of obligatory prayers, it is disliked to do that, because in most cases there is no need for it. But if there is a need, then there is nothing wrong with reading from the Mus-haf in that case. 
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni, 1/335: 
“Ahmad said: There is nothing wrong with leading the people in Qiyam prayer whilst reading from the Mus-haf. It was said to him: What about obligatory prayers? He said: I have not heard anything concerning that. Al-Qadi said: It is disliked in obligatory prayers, but there is nothing wrong with it in voluntary prayers if one has not memorized (Quran), but if one has memorized Quran then it is also disliked. He said: Ahmad was asked about leading the prayers whilst reading from the Mus-haf in Ramadan. He said: If that is necessary (it may be done)… and it was narrated from Ibn Hamid that it is equally permissible in both optional and obligatory prayers. 
The evidence for it being permissible is the report narrated by Abu Bakr Al-Athram and Ibn Abu Dawud (may Allah have mercy on them) from `A’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), according to which she would be led in prayer by a slave of hers who read from the Mus-haf . 
Az-Zuhri was asked about a man who read from the Mus-haf in Ramadan. He said: The best ones among us used to read from the Mus-hafs … 
Reading from the Mus-haf has been permitted because of the need to listen to the Quran and recite it in night prayers (Qiyam). 
The ruling on it being disliked applies only to those who have memorized the Quran, because they will be needlessly distracted from proper submissiveness in prayer (Khushu`) by that, and from looking at the place of prostration. And it is disliked in obligatory prayers in general, because usually there is no need for it.” 
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu` (4/27): 
“If a person reads Quran from the Mus-haf, this does not invalidate his prayer, whether he has memorized the Quran or not; in fact that is obligatory if he has not memorized Al-Fatihah. 
Does reading from the Mus-haf invalidate the prayer?
What we have mentioned, that reading from the Mus-haf does not invalidate the prayer, is our view and the view of Malik, Abu Yusuf, Muhammad and Ahmad. 
Reading from the Mus-haf in obligatory prayer
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it permissible for the imam to read from the Mus-haf during the five daily prayers, especially Fajr when lengthy reading is required and there is the fear of making mistakes or forgetting? 
He replied: 
“That is permissible if there is a need for it, just as it is permissible to read from the Mus-haf in Tarawih for one who has not memorized the Quran. Dhakwan, the freed slave of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) used to lead her in prayer in Ramadan, reading from the Mus-haf, as was narrated by Al-Bukhari in his Sahih in a Mu’allaq Majzum report. It is Sunnah to recite at length in Fajr prayer, so if the imam has not memorized Al-Mufassal or anything else from the rest of the Quran, it is permissible for him to recite from the Mus-haf. But it is prescribed for him to strive to memorize the Quran, or at least to memorize Al-Mufassal, so that he will not need to read from the Mus-haf. Al-Mufassal refers to the portion of the Quran that starts with Surat Qaf, up to the end of the Quran. Whoever strives to memorize, Allah will make it easy for him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty)” [Al-Talaq 65:2] 
“And We have indeed made the Quran easy to understand and remember; then is there any one who will remember (or receive admonition)?” [Al-Qamar 54:17]
And Allah is the Source of strength.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz, 11/117)

65925,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65925,A woman’s maternal uncle is a mahram and it is permissible for him to be alone with her,What is the ruling on a wife’s maternal uncle visiting her when she is alone during the time her husband is working? This situation has come up more than once.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The maternal uncle is a mahram for all the daughters and granddaughters of his sisters, because Allaah says in Soorat al-Nisa’, defining women who are forbidden in marriage: 
“Forbidden to you (for marriage) are: your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your father’s sisters, your mother’s sisters, your brother’s daughters, your sister’s daughters”
[al-Nisa’ 4:23] 
So there is nothing wrong with his visiting his sister’s daughter and being alone with her or travelling with her, so long as there are no reasons for suspicion, such as if he is an evildoer and cannot be trusted with his sister’s daughter. If there are any grounds for suspicion, then he is not allowed to be alone with or visit her when her husband is not present. 
See also question no. 21953. 
Some of the salaf – such as ‘Ikrimah and al-Sha’bi – were of the view that even though it is not permissible for a paternal uncle or a maternal uncle to marry their sister’s daughter or brother’s daughter, it is nevertheless not permissible for her to show her adornment in front of them, and she must observe hijab with them. They quoted two things as evidence for that: 
1 – The maternal uncle and paternal uncle are not mentioned in the verse of Soorat al-Ahzaab which says that it is permissible for a woman to show her adornment in front of her mahrams. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is no sin on them (the Prophet’s wives, if they appear unveiled) before their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their brother’s sons, or the sons of their sisters, or their own (believing) women, or their (female) slaves. And (O ladies), fear (keep your duty to) Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Ever All‑Witness over everything”
[al-Ahzaab 33:55]
Here Allaah does not mention the paternal uncle or maternal uncle. 
2 – They said: and because a maternal uncle or paternal uncle may describe the woman to his sons. 
But the majority of scholars are of the view that the maternal uncle and paternal uncle are among the mahrams in front of whom it is permissible for a woman to show her adornment. In response to the comment that the maternal uncle and paternal uncle are not mentioned in the verse, they said: 
They are not mentioned because their status is like that of the parents, hence Allaah calls the paternal uncle a father, in the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Or were you witnesses when death approached Ya’qoob (Jacob)? When he said unto his sons, ‘What will you worship after me?’ They said, ‘We shall worship your Ilaah (God — Allaah) the Ilaah (God) of your fathers, Ibraaheem (Abraham), Ismaa’eel (Ishmael), Ishaaq (Isaac), One Ilaah (God), and to Him we submit (in Islam)’”
[al-Baqarah 2:133]
Ismaa’eel was the paternal uncle of Ya’qoob (peace be upon them both) 
2 – They are not mentioned because it is sufficient to mention the brother’s son and sister’s son, so it is more appropriate that this ruling should apply to the paternal uncle and maternal uncle. 
Al-Sa’di (may Allaah have mercy on him) said (p. 788): 
“It is no sin on them” means if they do not observe hijab in front of them. No mention is made here of paternal uncles and maternal uncles because if women do not have to observe hijab in front of those whose paternal and maternal aunts they are, the sons of their brothers and sisters, even though they (these women) are of a higher status than them, then it is more likely that they do not have to observe hijab in front of their paternal and maternal uncles. End quote. 
With regard to the reason given, that the maternal uncle or paternal uncle may describe the woman to their sons, the majority of scholars responded to this by noting that this is a weak argument, because if this is accepted, it would imply that it is not permissible for a woman to uncover her adornment in front of any woman, because she may describe her to her sons! 
One thing which indicates that the view of the majority – that it is permissible for a woman to show her adornment to her paternal and maternal uncles, and that it is permissible for them to enter upon her and be alone with her – is correct is the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (4796) and Muslim (1445) from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), who said: Aflah, the brother of Abu’l-Qu’aysh, asked for permission to enter upon me after the (verse of) hijab had been revealed, and I said, I will not let him in until I ask the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) for permission, because his brother Abu’l-Qu’ays is not the one who breastfed me, rather the wife of Abu’l-Qu’ays breastfed me. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) entered upon me and I said to him: “O Messenger of Allaah, Aflah, the brother of Abu’l-Qu’aysh, asked for permission to enter upon me, but I refused to let him in until I asked your permission. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “What kept you from letting him in? He is your paternal uncle!” I said, “O Messenger of Allaah, the man is not the one who breastfed me, rather the wife of Abu’l-Qu’ays breastfed me.” He said: “Let him in, for he is your paternal uncle, may your right hand be rubbed with dust.” So if a paternal uncle through breastfeeding is allowed to enter upon a woman and be alone with her, then it is more appropriate that a paternal uncle through blood ties be allowed to do so, and the same applies to the maternal uncle.

65928,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65928,Can he observe a fast on behalf of one who is sick during the night in Ramadaan?,"If another member of your family is unwell, does it count as a fast if you keep a 24 hour one (without eating at sehri)?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
If a person 
    is sick and unable to fast, one of the following two scenarios must apply: 
    either his sickness is temporary, so he is allowed not to fast and he has to 
    make up the fast after he recovers and becomes able to fast, or his sickness 
    is chronic, in which case he is allowed not to fast but he must feed one 
    poor person for each day. 
See the 
    answer to question no. 37761. 
Secondly: 
Fasting can 
    only be done during the day, from dawn until sunset. The night is not the 
    time for fasting. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is 
    made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of 
    As‑Sawm (the fasts). They are Libaas [i.e. body-cover, or screen, or Sakan 
    (i.e. you enjoy the pleasure of living 
    with them —)] for you and you are the same for them. Allaah knows 
    that you used to deceive yourselves, so He turned to you (accepted your 
    repentance) and forgave you. So now have sexual relations with them and seek 
    that which Allaah has ordained for you (offspring), and eat and drink until 
    the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black 
    thread (darkness of night), then complete your Sawm (fast) till the 
    nightfall”

    [al-Baqarah 2:187]
This verse 
    describes the time for fasting – which is the day – and the time for 
    breaking the fast – which is the night. It is not valid, under any 
    circumstances, to make the nights of Ramadaan the time for fasting. 
It is proven 
    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade 
    continuous fasting. This was narrated by al-Bukhaari (1062) and Muslim 
    (1102). 
Continuous 
    fasting means not breaking the fast at night and continuing to fast night 
    and day. 
Imam 
    al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Chapter on continuous 
    fasting and those who say that there is no fasting at night because of the 
    words of Allaah, ‘then complete your Sawm (fast) till the nightfall’ 
    and the Prophet’s prohibition of that as a mercy to them and to avoid 
    hardship for them. 
Thirdly: 
The basic 
    principle with regard to physical acts of worship is that the Muslim should 
    do them on behalf of himself, and they cannot be done on behalf of others. 
    It is not permissible for anyone to pray on behalf of anyone else, or to 
    fast on behalf of anyone else, according to scholarly consensus. Rather Hajj 
    and ‘Umrah may be performed on behalf of one who is unable to do them during 
    his lifetime, as is stated in the saheeh texts. 
Ibn ‘Abd 
    al-Barr (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:  
With regard 
    to prayer, the scholarly consensus is that no one can pray on behalf of 
    anyone else, whether it is an obligatory prayer or a Sunnah or naafil 
    prayer, on behalf of one who is living or one who is dead. Similarly, 
    fasting on behalf of one who is alive is not valid and cannot be done on 
    behalf of anyone else. There is consensus on all of this and there is no 
    difference of opinion. 
But if a 
    person has died and still owes some fasts, this is a matter concerning which 
    the scholars, both ancient and modern, have differed. End quote. 

    Al-Istidhkaar, 3/340 
Conclusion: 
Fasting must 
    be done during the day, not at night. Fasting at night is not valid. 
It is not 
    valid for anyone to fast on behalf of a person who is sick. If there is the 
    hope that the sick person will recover, then he has to make up the fasts 
    after he gets better. If there is no hope of recovery, then he has to feed 
    one poor person for each day.

The ruling on delaying the prayer beyond its proper time


Time for Fajr prayer


When did the Prophet offer Fajr prayer?","Praise be to Allah.Times of the prayers
The five daily prayers have set times , the beginning and end of which are well defined, and the prayer must be offered on time. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, As-Salah (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours” [al-Nisa 4:103]
“This indicates that the prayers are obligatory and have set times, and are not valid at other times. 
These times are well established among the Muslims, young and old, knowledgeable and ignorant, and they learned that from their Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: “Pray as you have seen me praying.”  (Tafsir al-Sa’di, p. 204)
The ruling on delaying the prayer beyond its proper time
Delaying the prayer beyond its proper time with no excuse is a major sin, and Allah has warned us against it as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So woe unto those performers of Salah (prayers) (hypocrites), Those who delay their Salah (prayer from their stated fixed times)” [al-Ma'un 107:4-5]
“‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: (This means) those who delay their prayers from the proper time.” (Tafsir al-Qurtubi, 20/211)  
Time for Fajr prayer
We have stated in the answer to question no. 9940  the times of the five daily prayers. 
The time for Fajr prayer lasts from the onset of the true dawn until the sun starts to rise. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The time for Fajr prayer is from the breaking of dawn, so long as the sun has not started to rise.” (Narrated by Muslim, 612)
If a person offers this prayer during this time, he has prayed on time. Based on this, what is mentioned in the question about praying close to sunrise not being the right time is not correct. Rather the time for Fajr prayer lasts until the sun begins to rise. 
The questioner may be referring to some people who delay Fajr prayer until they are certain or think it most likely that the time for it has started. This is due to what is said about mistakes about the time of Fajr in the timetables that are currently available. 
But this mistake is not so serious, rather some scholars have stated that it is only a matter of between 20 and 30 minutes. 
When did the Prophet offer Fajr prayer?
It was the Prophet’s way to pray Fajr before the light of day appeared. This is indicated by a number of ahadith: 
1 – Al-Bukhari (560) and Muslim (646) narrated that Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray Fajr when it was still dark (ghalas). 
2- Al-Bukhari (872) and Muslim (645) narrated from ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray Fajr when it was still dark (ghalas) and the believing women would depart and no one would recognize them because it was so dark, or they would not recognize one another. 
“The word “ghalas'' refers to the darkness at the end of the night, as it says in the dictionary, and that is the beginning of the dawn.” (Subul al-Salam)
Al-Nawawi said: 
“The words “and no one would recognize them because it was so dark” refer to the fact that it was still nighttime and dark. Al-Dawudi said: What this means is that no one could tell if they were women or men.”  (Sharh Muslim by al-Nawawi) 
3 – Ibn Majah (671) narrated that Mughهth ibn Sumay said: I prayed Fajr with ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Zubayr in the darkness at the end of the night just before daybreak, and when he said the tasleem I turned to Ibn ‘Umar and said, What is this prayer? He said, This is how we prayed with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and with Abu Bakr and ‘Umar. When ‘Umar was stabbed, ‘Uthman delayed it until there was light. Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah. 
These ahadith indicate that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray Fajr at the beginning of its time. 
Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni (1/540): 
“With regard to Fajr prayer, it is better to pray when it is still dark. This is the view of Malik, al-Shafi'i and Ishaq. There is also evidence to this effect narrated from Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, Ibn Mas’ud, Abu Musa, Ibn al-Zubayr and ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz.”

I would like to know whether it is Bidah to do this? I have been told that everything is halal unless it has been specifically made haram. Please help as this is the time of year that people buy the cards from me and I really need to know whether I am doing something wrong.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, the basic principle is that transactions are permitted and allowed, and it is not permissible to describe anything as haram except with evidence. The ruling on the cards that you make for festivals varies according to the festivals in question. If they are cards with greetings for the festivals of the kuffaar, such as Christmas, or for festivals that are bid’ah (innovation), such as the birthday of the Prophet (al-Mawlid) or al-Isra’ and al-Mi’raaj, or festivals that involve imitating the kuffaar, such as national holidays and birthdays, then it is not permissible for you to make them or sell them, and it is not permissible for anyone to buy them, because that implies approval of those festivals that go against Islam, and because it is cooperating in sin and transgression.
But if they are for Islamic festivals – and there are no Islamic festivals except Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha – then it is permissible for you to make greetings cards for them, and it is permissible for you to sell them, so long as you make sure to use phrases that are prescribed or permissible according to sharee’ah, such as “May Allah accept from us and from you” and so on.
In the answer to question no. 947 we stated that it is haram to congratulate the kuffaar on their festivals. In the answer to question no. 50074 we quoted the statement of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas about taking part in the millennium celebrations, in which it was noted that it is not permissible to help the kuffaar in their festivals, and among the ways of helping them that the scholars mentioned are: making clothes, mementoes and cards.”
In the answers to questions no. 49014, 49021 and 36442 you will find that it is permissible to offer greetings on the Islamic festivals.

65944,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65944,Why is the Prophet’s grave in his mosque even though it is forbidden to take graves as places of worship?,"The hadeeth says, “May Allaah curse the Jews, for they have taken the graves of their Prophets as places of worship”. So how come the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is inside his mosque in Madeenah?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars have 
      discussed this issue, in the past and more recently, and they refuted 
      those who quote the fact that the grave of the Prophet  (peace and 
      blessings of Allaah be upon him) is inside his mosque as evidence that it 
      is permissible to take graves as places of worship, or to include graves 
      in mosques. We will quote the fatwas of some of our prominent scholars, 
      which discuss in detail the matter raised in the question. 

    1 – Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on 
    him) said: 

    There is a specious argument put forward by those who worship 
    graves, namely the fact that the grave of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) is in his mosque. The answer to that is 
    that the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) did not bury him in his 
    mosque, rather they buried him in the house of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be 
    pleased with her). When al-Waleed ibn ‘Abd al-Malik expanded the Mosque of 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) at the end of 
    the first century, he incorporated the room into the mosque, but he did 
    wrong thereby, and some of the scholars denounced him for that, but he 
    believed that there was nothing wrong with it for the sake of expanding the 
    mosque. 

    It is not permissible for a Muslim to take that as evidence 
    that mosques may be built over graves, or that people may be buried inside 
    mosques, because that goes against the saheeh ahaadeeth, and because it is a 
    means that may lead to shirk by associating the occupants of the graves in 
    worship with Allaah.  End quote. 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 
    5/388, 389. 

    2 – Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on praying in a mosque in which 
    there is a grave. 

    He replied: 

    Praying in a mosque in which there is a grave falls into two 
    categories: 

    (i)Either the grave was there 
    before the mosque, and the mosque was built over the grave. It is essential 
    to shun this mosque and not pray therein, and the one who built it must 
    knock it down; if he does not do so, then the Muslim authorities must knock 
    it down.

    (ii)Or the mosque was there before 
    the grave, and the deceased was buried after the mosque was built. In the 
    case the grave must be dug up, and the remains taken out and buried with the 
    people (in the graveyard).

    As for praying in such a mosque, it is permissible so long as 
    the grave is not in front of the worshipper, because the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade praying in the direction of 
    graves. 

    With regard to the grave of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) which is incorporated into his mosque, it 
    is well known that the Mosque of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) was built before his death, and was not built over his 
    grave. It is also well known that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) was not buried in the mosque, rather he was buried in 
    his house which was separate from the mosque. At the time of al-Waleed ibn 
    ‘Abd al-Malik he wrote to his governor in Madeenah, who was ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd 
    al-‘Azeez, in 88 AH, ordering him to dismantle the Prophet’s Mosque and add 
    to it the rooms of the wives of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him). ‘Umar gathered the prominent people and fuqaha’, and 
    read the letter of the caliph al-Waleed to them. That caused them distress, 
    and they said: “Leave it as it is, that is better.” And it was narrated that 
    Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib denounced the incorporation of ‘Aa’ishah’s room into 
    the mosque, as if he feared that the grave would be taken as a place of 
    worship. 

    Umar wrote a letter to that effect to al-Waleed, and 
    al-Waleed sent word to him ordering him to carry out his instructions, so 
    ‘Umar had no other choice.  So you see that the grave of the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was not placed in the mosque, 
    and the mosque was not built over it, so there are no grounds for those who 
    try to quote this as evidence that people may be buried inside mosques or 
    that mosques may be built over graves. 

    It is proven that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “May the curse of Allaah be upon the Jews and the 
    Christians; they have taken the graves of their Prophets as places of 
    worship.” He said that as he was dying, as a warning to his ummah against 
    doing what they did. When Umm Salamah told him of a church that she had seen 
    in Ethiopia and the images therein, he said: “Those people, if a righteous 
    man among them died, they would build a place of worship over his grave. 
    They are the most evil of people before Allaah.” And it was narrated from 
    Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Among the most evil of people 
    upon whom the Hour will come when they are still alive are those who take 
    graves as places of worship.” Narrated by Imam Ahmad with a jayyid isnaad. 

    The believer should not accept to follow the ways of the Jews 
    and the Christians, or to be among the most evil of people.

Please guide me to what is correct.,"There is no specific du’a to be said at the time of suhur. What is prescribed is to say Bismillah at the beginning and to praise Him when one stops eating, as should be done at every meal.","Du’a when breaking fast


Du’a for Suhur","Praise be to Allah.Du’a when breaking fast
Yes, there are du’as that are narrated in the Sunnah which the fasting person may say at the time of breaking the fast. He may say “Dhahaba al-zamau wa abtalat al-‘uruq wa thabat al-ajru in sha Allah (Thirst has gone, the veins are moist, and the reward is assured, if Allah wills).” He may also say whatever du’a he wants, not because that is mentioned specifically in the Sunnah, but because it is the end of an act of worship, and it is prescribed for the Muslim to say du’a in that case. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
Is there any du’a narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which is to be said at the time of breaking the fast? When should it be said? Should the fasting person repeat the adhan after the muadhdhin or continue breaking his fast? 
He replied: 
“The time of breaking the fast is a time when du’as are answered , because it is the end of an act of worship, and because a person is usually at his weakest when breaking his fast. The greater a person’s sense of helplessness and weakness is, the closer he is to humility before Allah. The du’a that is narrated is: “Allahumma laka sumtu wa ‘ala rizqika aftartu (O Allah, for You have I fasted and by Your provision I have broken my fast).” And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:  “Dhahaba al-zamau wa abtalat al-‘uruq wa thabat al-ajr in sha Allah (Thirst has gone, the veins are moist, and the reward is assured, if Allah wills).” Although there may be some weakness in these two hadiths, some scholars classed them as hasan. Whatever the case, if you says these du’as or some others when breaking the fast, this is a time when du’as are answered.” (Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 19/question no. 341) 
For information on the isnad of these hadiths (Dhahaba al-zamau and Allahumma laka sumtu) please see the answer to question no. 26879 , where it states that the former is hasan and the latter is da'if, and refers to a fatwa of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah concerning fabricated du’as.
Du’a for Suhur
With regard to suhur, there is no specific du’a to be said at this time. What is prescribed is to say Bismillah at the beginning and to praise Him when one stops eating, as should be done at every meal. 
But the one who delays his sahur until the last third of the night also catches up with the time of the divine descent, and this is a time when du’as are answered. 
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Our Lord, may He be blessed and exalted, comes down to the lowest heaven every night when the last third of the night is left, and He says: ‘Who will call upon Me, that I may answer him? Who will ask of Me, that I may give him? Who will ask Me for forgiveness, that I may forgive him?’” Narrated by al-Bukhari (1094) and Muslim (758). So he should say du’a at this time because it is a time when du’a is answered, not because of sahur. 
With regard to the intention , the site thereof is the heart, and it is not prescribed to utter it out loud . Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: “Whoever thinks in his heart that he will fast tomorrow has formed the intention.”

Can i normally fast on journey coz its not as hard as during those days, will my fast be valied? What if i take off the last 10days and do itikaaf at the same city or do i do itikaf with my family which i dont get to spend so much time with them? Also helping my wife with house work because she gets so tired and she cant do so much of ibadah. Should i do itikaf or spend time with my family and do ibadah together?please advice me.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
It is permissible for a traveller to break the fast in Ramadaan, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Sawm (fasts) that month, and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days. Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you”
[al-Baqarah 2:185]
It makes no difference whether the travel is difficult or easy. 
But is it better for him to fast or not to fast? 
The answer is that it is better for him to fast, unless he experiences difficulty in which case it is better for him not to fast. 
This is discussed in more detail in the answers to questions no. 65629 and 20156. 
Secondly: 
It is better for you to go back to your family and stay with them in order to help your wife with the housework and help her to do acts of worship and to benefit from the last ten days. Your staying with your family to encourage them to worship is better than your observing i’tikaaf on your own and depriving them of that help because of your being far away from them. ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) told us about what the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do during the last ten days, which included waking up his family – i.e., so that they could worship, pray and say du’aa’. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not observe i’tikaaf and leave his family with no help or care. It is proven that Safiyyah (may Allaah be pleased with her) visited him when he was in i’tikaaf and it is proven that they observed i’tikaaf with him. I’tikaaf is a private act of worship that does not benefit anyone else. Your staying with your family and encouraging them to worship and treating them kindly is an action that benefits others and you will not be deprived of the reward for their worship and you will not deprive yourself of worship, because you can accompany your family to qiyaam al-layl (night prayers) in a mosque, and you can wake them up at the end of the night to say du’aa’ and read Qur’aan. This is something good that will include you and your family. So we advise you to go back to your family and stay with them during the last ten days, and encourage them to worship Allaah. If you think that your family are doing well, and that they are performing acts of worship regularly, then you can observe i’tikaaf on some nights in your local mosque, so you can combine different kinds of worship and attain a great reward in sha Allaah. We ask Allaah to help you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him, and to accept the good deeds from you and your family.

Is it permissible for women to gather in one house to pray Taraweeh in congregation? If that is permissible, should the prayer be recited quietly or what? How can they pray in congregation if the prayer is to be recited aloud like Fajr or ‘Isha’ and one of them leads the others – should she recite out loud or not?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    It is permissible for women to gather to pray Taraweeh in the 
    house of one of them, subject to the condition that there is no wanton 
    display of adornments (tabarruj) involved in their going out, and that there 
    is no danger of fitnah. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    There is nothing wrong with women attending Taraweeh prayers 
    so long as there is no danger of fitnah, subject to the condition that they 
    go out in a decorous manner, not making a wanton display of their adornments 
    or wearing perfume. End quote. 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 
    14, question no. 808. 
But it is better for 
    each of them to pray on her own in her house, and in an inner part of the 
    house. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said 
    that it is better for women to offer obligatory prayers in their houses than 
    to pray in the mosque, so it is more apt that this should also apply to 
    naafil prayers. 

    It was narrated from Umm Salamah (may Allaah be pleased with 
    her) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “The best mosques for women are the innermost parts of their houses.” 
    Narrated by Ahmad, 26002; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh 
    al-Targheeb, 341. 

    Indeed it is better for a woman to pray in her home than to 
    pray in congregation in al-Masjid al-Haraam (in Makkah) or in the Prophet’s 
    Mosque behind the Prophet himself  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him). 

    It was narrated from Umm Humayd, the wife of Abu Humayd 
    al-Saa’idi (may Allaah be pleased with them both) that she came to the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: “O 
    Messenger of Allaah, I love to pray with you.” He said: “I know that you 
    love to pray with me, but your praying in your room is better for you than 
    your praying in your house, and your praying in your house is better for you 
    than your praying in your courtyard, and your praying in your courtyard is 
    better for you than your praying in the mosque of your people, and your 
    praying in the mosque of your people is better for you than your praying in 
    my mosque.” So she gave orders that a ‘mosque’ be built for her in the 
    innermost and darkest part of her house, and she used to pray there until 
    she met Allaah (i.e., died). 

    Narrated by Ahmad, 26550; classed as saheeh by Ibn Khuzaymah, 
    1689; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 340. 

    Imam Ibn Khuzaymah included this hadeeth in a chapter 
    entitled: It is preferable for a woman to pray in her house rather than in 
    her courtyard, and in the mosque of her people rather than in the Mosque of 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), even though 
    one prayer offered in the Mosque of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) is equivalent to one thousand prayers offered in any 
    other mosque. This is the evidence that the words of the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “One prayer in this mosque of mine is 
    better than a thousand prayers in any other mosque” refer only to men and 
    not women.  

    Al-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeem Abaadi (may Allaah have mercy on 
    him)said: 
It is better for women 
    to pray in their houses because then there is no danger of fitnah. This 
    ruling is even more emphatic because of the wanton display (tabarruj) and 
    adornment of women.  

    ‘Awn al-Ma’bood, 2/193 

    Secondly: 

    If women gather together in one house in accordance with the 
    conditions mentioned above, it is permissible for them to pray in 
    congregation. The one who is leading them in prayer should stand in the 
    middle of the (first) row, not out in front, and she should not lead men in 
    prayer even if they are her mahrams. She should recite our loud just as men 
    do in the prayers where reciting out loud is required, so long as no men 
    except her mahrams can hear her voice. 
It was narrated that Umm 
    Waraqah bint ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Nawfal al-Ansaariyyah asked the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) for permission to appoint a 
    muezzin in her house who would call her to prayer, and he told her to lead 
    the people of her household in prayer. 

    Narrated by Abu Dawood, 591; classed as hasan by Shaykh 
    al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 493. 

    And it was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah that she would give the 
    call to prayer and lead other women in prayer, standing in the middle of the 
    row. 

    And ‘Aa’ishah led women in obligatory prayers, standing in 
    the midst of them. 

    And it was narrated that Hujayrah bint Haseen said: Umm 
    Salamaah led us in prayer standing in the midst of the women. 

    And it was narrated from Umm al-Hasan that she saw Umm 
    Salamah, the wife of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him), leading women in prayer, standing with them in their row. 

    Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, after 
    narrating these reports: 

    In conclusion, these reports are sound and may be acted upon, 
    especially since they confirm the general meaning of the words of the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Women are the 
    twin halves of men…” 

    Sifat Salaat al-Nabi  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him), p. 153-155. 

    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
She should recite out 
    loud in prayers where it is required to recite out loud, but if there are 
    any men present, she should not recite out loud, unless they are her 
    mahrams, in which case she may do so.
