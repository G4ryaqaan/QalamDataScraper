13403,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13403,Attitude towards fitnah,I have heard that there is a certain attitude that the Muslim should adopt if he faces a time of fitnah (tribulation). What is the attitude towards fitnah?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.There is a certain attitude which the Muslim 
    should adopt towards fitnah to that this fitnah will not have a negative effect on him, and so that he will not have a negative effect on the 
    Muslim community. 
This attitude includes the following: 

    (a)
    Deliberation, gentleness, forbearance and not being hasty
Deliberation, gentleness and forbearance at 
    times of tribulation and upheaval are praiseworthy traits, because they enable the Muslim to see things as they really are and to understand what 
    is going on. 
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no gentleness in a thing but it adorns it, and the absence of gentleness in anything makes it ugly.” Narrated 
    by Muslim, 4698.  
And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said to Ashajj ‘Abdul Qays: “You have two characteristics which Allaah loves, forbearance and deliberation.” Narrated by Muslim, 24. 
So we must all be gentle in our thinking and 
    attitudes, and with regard to all events that occur, and we should not be hasty, because that is not the way of the Muslim ummah, especially at 
    times of fitnah. 

    (b)
    – Sabr (patience)
We need a great deal of patience, especially 
    at times of fitnah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And certainly, We shall test you with 
    something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to As- Saabiroon (the patient). 
Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: “Truly, to Allaah we 
    belong and truly, to Him we shall return.”
They are those on whom are the Salawaat 
    (i.e. who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones”
[al-Baqarah 2:155-157]
It was narrated from Abu Tha’labah 
    al-Khushani that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “After you there will come the days of patience (i.e., days 
    which require patience). Patience during those (days) will be like grasping a live coal.  During those (days) the reward for the one who adheres 
    to the commands of Allaah will be equivalent to the reward of fifty men who did an action like his.” He said, “O Messenger of Allaah, the reward 
    of fifty of them?” He said, “The reward of fifty of you.” 
Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4341; Ibn Maajah, 
    4014. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Saheehah, 494. 
With patience, the difference between those 
    who are determined and confident and those who are cowardly and weak becomes apparent. Hence the righteous salaf understood the importance of 
    patience at times of tribulation and new developments. There follow some examples from their life stories: 
When the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with 
    them) were being persecuted and tested at the beginning of Islam in Makkah, the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would 
    pass by them and remind them to be patient. When he passed by the family of Yaasir he would say, “Patience, O family of Yaasir, for you are 
    promised Paradise.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Takhreej Fiqh al-Seerah, p. 103. 
It was narrated that al-Zubayr ibn ‘Adiyy 
    said: We came to Anas ibn Maalik and complained to him about what we were suffering from al-Hajjaaj. He said, “Be patient, for there never comes 
    to you a time but what follows it is worse, until you meet your Lord. I heard this from your Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him).” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7068.
 Al-Mustawrid al-Qurashi said to ‘Amr ibn 
    al-‘Aas: “I heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: ‘The Hour will begin when the Romans are the 
    greatest people in number.’” ‘Amr said, “Watch what you say!” He said, “I am saying what I heard from the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him).” He said, “If you say that, it is a fact, for they have four qualities. They are the most patient of people at 
    times of tribulation; they recover quickly from calamity; they are quick to recover and attack again after defeat; and they are good to the poor, 
    orphans and the weak. And a fifth good quality that they have is that they resist the oppression of kings.”  Narrated by Muslim, 2889. 
Al-Nu’maan ibn Basheer said: “If there is 
    nothing left in the world but trials and tribulation, then face the trials with patience.” 
When the imam of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah, 
    Ahmad ibn Hanbal, faced the overwhelming fitnah of those who said that the Qur’aan was created, during the reigns of al-Mu’moon, al-Mu’tasim and 
    al-Waathiq, when he was subjected to lengthy imprisonment and severe beatings, he bore that with patience and adhered to his religion, the 
    straight path, until Allaah granted him victory and relieved him of that distress. 

    (c)
    Justice and fairness in all things
One of the strongest causes of differences 
    among people, especially at times of fitnah, is the lack of justice and fairness. If the Muslim strives to become fair to himself and to other 
    people, then many of the problems that arise among Muslims, whether on the individual or communal level, will be solved, in sha Allah. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whenever you give your word (i.e. 
    judge between men or give evidence), say the truth”
[al-An’aam 6:152] 
“and let not the enmity and hatred of 
    others make you avoid justice. Be just: that is nearer to piety”
[al-Maa’idah 5:8]
So it is essential to be just in our words 
    and deeds, especially at times of fitnah, in the sense that we should examine each matter and note its good and bad aspects, weigh them up, and 
    then pass judgement, because examining matters thoroughly will protect the Muslim from attributing to Islam things that are not in accordance with 
    the commands of Allaah. So your justice and fairness at the time of fitnah will save you, in sha Allah.  
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him) said:  I urge you, my brothers, to be just and balanced in all things, to look at all issues surrounding any given 
    matter, to find out the more correct ruling concerning it, and to judge all matters in the same way. This is an important principle which  the 
    wise man must follow in his relationship with Allaah and in his relationship with other people, to be fair, for Allaah loves those who are fair. 
There follow some examples from the lives of 
    our righteous forebears (the salaf) of their keenness to be just and fair: 
Muslim (1828) narrated that ‘Abd al-Rahmaan 
    ibn Shimaasah said: I came to ‘Aa’ishah and asked her about something, and she said, “Where are you from?” I said, “I am from Egypt.” She said, 
    “What was the behaviour of your governor towards you in this war of yours?” I said: “We did not experience anything bad from him. If the camel of 
    one of our men died, he would give him another camel. If any one of us lost his slave, he would give him another slave. If anybody was in need of 
    the basic necessities of life, he would provide them with provisions.” She said: “The treatment that was meted out to my brother, Muhammad ibn Abi 
    Bakr, does not prevent me from telling you what I heard from the Messenger of Allah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He said in 
    this house of mine: ‘O Allaah, whoever gains some kind of control over the affairs of my people and is hard upon them, be hard upon him, and 
    whoever gains some kind of control over the affairs of my people and is kind to them, be kind to him.’” 
Al-Nawawi said, commenting on this hadeeth: 
This indicates that we should mention the 
    virtues of good people, and not refrain from doing so because we dislike them etc. They differed concerning the way in which this Muhammad was 
    killed. It was said that he was killed in battle, and that he was killed as a prisoner of war after the battle… 
The governor in question here was Mu’aawiyah 
    ibn Hudayj who killed Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr. Al-Siyar, 3/38.

Is it permissible for him to pray at home?,The sick person is excused from Jumu`ah prayer and from praying in congregation. What is meant by that is the kind of sickness which means that it is too difficult for the person to go and pray in the mosque.,"Patience in the face of calamities


Can you pray at home if you are sick?","Praise be to Allah.Patience in the face of calamities
We ask Allah to bless the sick Muslims with reward and healing. Undoubtedly the one who suffers sickness and bears it with patience, Allah will expiate his sins thereby and raise him in status. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is nothing that befalls a believer, not even a thorn that pricks him, but Allah will record for him thereby one hasanah (good deed) or will remove from him one sin.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2572) 
Can you pray at home if you are sick?
The sick person is excused from Jumu`ah prayer and from praying in congregation . What is meant by that is the kind of sickness which means that it is too difficult for the person to go and pray in the mosque. This is based on the following evidence: 

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.” [Al-Taghabun 64:16]
And He says (interpretation of the meaning):  “Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.” [Al-Baqarah 2:286]
And He says (interpretation of the meaning): “No blame or sin is there upon the blind, nor is there blame or sin upon the lame, nor is there blame or sin upon the sick.” [Al-Fath 48:17]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If I command you to do a thing then do as much of it as you can.” (Agreed upon) 
And when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fell sick, he did not attend prayers in congregation, even though his house was beside the mosque. 
Ibn Mas’ud said: “There was a time when no one stayed away from the prayer except a hypocrite who was known for his hypocrisy or one who was sick…” (Narrated by Muslim, 654) 

All of this evidence indicates that the sick person is spared the obligation to pray Jumu`ah and prayers in congregation . (See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/438) 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“It is obligatory for Muslim men to pray in the mosque and increase the numbers of the Muslims, and to go out to the mosques (to pray), otherwise they will be resembling the hypocrites. Ibn Mas’ud said: “There was a time when no one stayed away from the prayer except a hypocrite who was known for his hypocrisy.” 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) thought of burning down the houses of those who stayed away from the prayer. 
So you and every Muslim who is able to must pray in the mosque; the Muslim is not allowed to pray at home unless he has a valid shar’i excuse such as sickness or fear . May Allah help us all to follow His guidance.” (Majmu’ Fatawa, vol. 12)

“It is not permissible for men to have gold teeth fitted unless that is essential, because it is haram for a man to wear gold or adorn himself with it. 
With regard to women, if it is customary for women to adorn themselves with gold teeth, then there is nothing wrong with them doing that. A woman may plate her teeth with gold if it is customary for women to adorn themselves in this manner, and it is not extravagance. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Gold and silk have been permitted for the females of my ummah.” 
If a woman dies in this state, or if a man dies who wore a gold tooth out of necessity, then it should be removed , unless there is the fear of mutilation of the corpse, i.e., there is the fear that the gum may be split, in which case it should be left alone. That is because gold is considered to be a kind of wealth, and wealth is to be inherited by the heirs of the deceased; leaving it with the deceased and burying it is a waste of money.

Do i have to be punished with hundred lashes or is there any other punishment for this in our religion. And if there is please let me know and I also want to know can I marry a chaste person after indulging in masturbation so many times. Please answer in accordance with Quran and Sunnah.,"With regard to masturbation, the basic ruling is that it is prohibited according to the majority of scholars, and the one who does it should be given a Ta`zir punishment, but it is not like Zina.","Is masturbation prohibited?


Punishment for Masturbation in Islam","Praise be to Allah.Is masturbation prohibited?
The masturbation is prohibited , as we have explained in the answer to question no. 329 . You have to repent from this action and give it up , and regret what you have done , and resolve not to go back to it. 
There are many punishments for the sinner in this world, let alone the punishment that he deserves in the Hereafter. We have already mentioned some of these punishments in the answer to question no. 23425 . 
So hasten to repent sincerely before you are no longer able to do so, and before you feel regret at the time when regret will be to no avail. 
If Allah honours you by enabling you to repent, you will be forgiven for this sin, and it will be as if it never happened. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who repents is like the one who did not sin.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah; classed as good by Al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, 3427) 
Punishment for Masturbation in Islam
Breaking the hymen as a result of masturbation is not Zina, and no Hadd (fixed prescribed punishment) or expiation is required. 
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about masturbation and he replied: 
With regard to masturbation, the basic ruling is that it is prohibited according to the majority of scholars, and the one who does it should be given a Ta`zir punishment (punishments that are not fixed in Islam and are decided by the ruler), but it is not like Zina. And Allah knows best.” (Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra, 3/439) 
If it is obvious that the hymen has been broken as a result of masturbation, then you have to tell your fiancé what happened to you, without giving any details that may cause you embarrassment. It is sufficient for him to know that this happened without any fornication, because the hymen may be broken because of exercise, being beaten, falling or being sick. 
You will never be exposed if you repent to Allah and are sincere in your repentance, for Allah is the Concealer and loves concealment.

Smoking is one of the things that are forbidden. For more information on the 
    evidence for it being forbidden, please see question no. 1812 and
    10922. 
Secondly: 
If every person were able to live in this world according to his wishes and 
    desires, there would be no misery in this world and it could not be described as hardship; there would be no problems that need to be solved and 
    dealt with. But in reality it is a mixture of sweet and bitter. Each of us is trying to live his life according to his wishes and desires, wishing 
    that others would understand that. But there are many obstacles in the way. This is the reality of this world; no matter how much enjoyment we 
    find in it, it will ultimately end in sorrow and regret. 
The feelings of anger that you experience as a reaction towards someone who smokes 
    in front of you are justifiable feelings. Indeed I would go further and say that most wise people would naturally agree with you, because man is 
    by nature repulsed by bad actions, in addition to that fact that you are being physically harmed by this smoke. 
But a person must understand how he can express his feelings towards things and he 
    must find the best way to express his feelings in different situations that do not suit him. When a person can overcome this obstacle 
    successfully, he will have taken an important step towards achieving his goal.  
Therefore we have to realize that people do not respond to the wishes of the one 
    who issues commands with an attitude of force and compulsion, rather they will move far away from the one who is like that, even though they may 
    believe that what he is saying or demanding is in itself correct and acceptable.   
Simply feeling angry towards these things that you mention is something that is 
    acceptable, but anger on its own does not bring about the desired results in most cases. Controlling your nerves and feelings, and looking for an 
    appropriate way to express them will bring about the desired results in the shortest and easiest way. Have you tried expressing how much the 
    smoking bothers you and the bad effect it has on you, in a calm and polite manner? 
Most smokers, if you ask them to stop in a calm manner, explaining the reason, 
    will respond immediately. 
Conversely, they will respond to those who advise them in a bad way in an even 
    worse manner, with few exceptions. If a person wants to achieve his goal, he has to be patient, careful and speak well.  
You ask “do I have to control myself”? Definitely the answer will be yes, you have 
    to have control yourself with these and with other people. How many things there are in this world that provoke anger. 
Controlling yourself and your feelings must be one of your priorities. Our noble and merciful 
    Prophet taught us this. When that man came to him and said, “O Messenger of Allaah, advise me,” the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said, “Do not become angry.” The man repeated his question several times and the Messenger said, “Do not become angry.” (Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 6116). 
How can a person live if he does not equip himself with patience? 
Try to control your nerves by all possible means. Try to select friends who will 
    help you to control yourself and become patient. 
Keep away from any friends and colleagues who annoy you and get on your nerves. 
    Try as much as possible to avoid the situations that provoke your anger. 
First and last, seek help through du’aa’ and asking Allaah to help you to be 
    patient in all situations. 
Do not say that you cannot control your nerves, for feeling that you will fail may 
    lead to it becoming a reality which you give in to and accept.  
If you are determined and have a sincere intention, then in sha Allah you will 
    reach your goal. But you should note that you will find that difficult [in the beginning]. But have confidence that you will eventually gain 
    control of yourself and this bitterness and struggle will become sweet on the day when you find it bears fruit.

          The scholars are agreed that the father is obliged to spend on his small 
          children who have no money of their own until they reach adulthood. 
 
          Ibn al-Mundhir (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “All 
          of the scholars from whom we learned are agreed that a person is obliged 
          to spend on his young children who have no money of their own, because 
          a man’s child is part of him, and the child is part of the father. Just 
          as he is obliged to spend on himself and his wife, he is also obliged 
          to spend on his descendants and ascendants.” (al-Mughni, 8/171). 
 
          The obligation of spending on one’s child is based on 
          the Qur’aan, the Sunnah and scholarly consensus (ijmaa’). 
 
          In the Qur’aan, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “Then if they give suck to the children for you, give 
          them their due payment”[al-Talaaq 65:6]
 
          The obligation of paying for breastfeeding is given to the father. And 
          Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 “but 
          the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother’s food and 
          clothing on a reasonable basis”[al-Baqarah 
          2:233]
 
          From the Sunnah: the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Hind: “Take what 
          is sufficient for you and your child, on a reasonable basis.” (al-Bukhaari, 
          5364; Muslim, 1714) 
 
          With regard to ijmaa’, we have quoted it above. 
 
          They (the scholars) are agreed that the father has to 
          spend on his incapable children, male and female alike, until they become 
          independent, whether they are old or young. 
 
          They agreed that the father does not have to spend on 
          a child who has wealth and is of independent means, even if that child 
          is small. 
 
          They agreed that a father does not have to spend on a 
          son who has reached adulthood and is able to earn a living. 
 
          They differed as to whether a father has to spend on 
          an adult son who is poor but is able to earn a living. Most of the scholars 
          think that he does not have to spend on him, because he is able to work. 
 
          Some of them said that the father does have to spend 
          on his adult son who is poor, even if he is able to earn a living, basing 
          that on the words of the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to Hind: “Take what is sufficient 
          for you and your child, on a reasonable basis.” He did not make any 
          exception for one who has reached adulthood or is physically sound. 
 
          And because he is a poor child, he deserves to be spent 
          on by his rich father, as is also the case if a child is chronically 
          sick or blind. 
 
          Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on 
          him) was asked about a rich father who has a son who is poor: does the 
          rich father have to spend on his poor son? 
 
          He answered: “Yes, he has to spend on his son on a reasonable 
          basis, if the son is poor and is unable to earn a living and the father 
          is well off.” (Summarized from al-Fataawa al-Kubraa, 3/363; Majmoo’ 
          al-Fataawa, 34/105). 
 
          They also differed concerning a daughter who reaches adulthood – does 
          the father have to spend on her or not? 
 
          Most of the scholars said that he does have to spend 
          on her until she gets married. This is more likely to be correct, and 
          Allaah knows best, because she is unable to earn a living. 
 
          This is a summary of what the scholars have said. You

          stones. The man in the river came towards him, and when he wanted to 
          get out, the other man threw a stone into his mouth and sent him back 
          to where he started. Every time he tried to get out, the other man threw 
          a stone into his mouth and sent him back. I said, ‘What is this?’ They 
          said, ‘The one whom you saw in the river was one who consumed riba.’” 
          (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2085).

          With regard to shaving the beard: 
 
          It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased 
          with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Be different from 
          the mushrikeen, trim the moustache and let the beard grow.” (Narrated 
          by al-Bukhaari, 5892, Muslim, 601). 
 
          Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:
 
           The beard (al-lahyah) is that which grows on the 
          cheeks and chin, as was explained by the author of al-Qaamoos. It is 
          obligatory to leave the hair that grows on the cheeks and chin, and 
          not to shave it or cut it. 
 
          May Allaah reform the affairs of all the Muslims. 
 
          Fataawa Islamiyyah, 2/325. 
 
          Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
 
          The definition of the beard (al-lahyah) as stated by 
          the scholars of the (Arabic) language is the hair of the face, jawbone 
          and cheeks, in the sense that everything that grows on the cheeks, jawbone 
          and chin is part of the beard. Removing any part of it also comes under 
          the heading of sin, because the Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Leave the beard alone” 
          and “Let the beard grow.” This indicates that it is not permissible 
          to remove any part of it, but the sin varies in degree; shaving is more 
          serious than removing a part of it because it is a more extreme action 
          and the one who shaves it more clearly goes against the command than 
          the one who trims it.

          With regard to praying behind one whose sin is obvious, 
          the scholars differed concerning this issue, and there are two opinions. 
 
          The first view is that it is not correct to pray behind 
          a faasiq (rebellious sinner). 
 
          This is the view of Ahmad and Maalik, in one of the two 
          reports narrated from them. 
 
          Shaykh Mustafa al-Ruhaybaani said: (Section) (It is not 
          correct to pray behind a faasiq at all): i.e., whether his fisq (sin, 
          rebellion) has to do with his beliefs or his doing a haraam action, 
          even if it is concealed, because Allaah says (interpretation of the 
          meaning): 
 
          “Is then he who is a believer like him who is a Faasiq 
          (disbeliever and disobedient to Allaah)? [al-Sajdah 
          32:18]
 
          Mataalib Ooli al-Nuha, 1/653 
 
          Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] (may Allaah have mercy 
          on him) said: 
 
          The imaams are agreed that it is disliked (makrooh) to 
          pray behind a Faasiq, but they differed as to whether the prayer is 
          valid. Some said that it is not valid, such as Maalik and Ahmad according 
          to one of the two reports narrated from them. Some said that it is valid, 
          such as Abu Haneefah, al-Shaafa’i, and the other report from [Malik 
          and Ahmad]. But they did not dispute concerning the fact that such a 
          one should not be appointed [to lead the prayer]. 
 
          Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 23/358 
 
          The second opinion, that prayer behind a faasiq is valid, 
          even if his sin is obvious, is the correct view and it is the view favoured 
          by Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him). The 
          evidence for this view is as follows: 
 
          1 – The general meaning of the hadeeth of the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “The people should be led 
          in prayer by the one among them who has most knowlegde of the Book of 
          Allaah.” (Narrated by Muslim, 673). 
 
          2 – The specific meaning of the words of the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) concerning oppressive leaders 
          who lead the prayer at the wrong time: “Pray the prayer on time, then 
          if you come to them at the time when they are praying, pray with them, 
          and it will be a naafil prayer for you.” (Narrated by Muslim, 648). 
          And al-Bukhaari narrated: “If the imaam leads the prayer correctly, 
          then he and you will receive the rewards, but if he makes a mistake 
          (in the prayer) then you will receive the reward for the prayer and 
          the sin (will be his).” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 694). 
 
          3 – The Sahaabah, including Ibn ‘Umar, used to pray behind 
          al-Hajjaaj, and Ibn ‘Umar was one of the keenest of people to follow 
          the Sunnah and pay attention to it, and al-Hajjaaj was known to be one 
          of the most rebellious and sinful of the slaves of Allaah. 
 
          It might also be said that everyone whose prayer is valid, 
          it is also valid for him to lead the prayer. There is no evidence to 
          suggest that we should differentiate between the validity of the prayer 
          and the validity of leading the prayer, because if a person commits 
          a sin, he does so for himself, but this is merely theoretical. See al-Sharh 
          al-Mumti’ by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 4/304). 
 
          You should note that the reward for leading the prayers 
          is very great and it is a great honour. The Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that the one who has 
          more knowledge of Qur’aan (i.e., the one who has memorized more) is 
          the one who should be given precedence in leading the prayer. (See Question 
          no. 1875) Therefore if someone else knows 
          more Qur’aan than you do, he should be given precedence. If there is 
          no one other than yourself, then it is o.k. for you to lead the others 
          in prayer, even if you are a sinner for the reasons explained above. 
           
 
          Finally, we advise you to fear Allaah and to avoid waging 
          war against Him by sinning. Hasten to repent to Allaah before death 
          comes to you and you regret it at the time when regret will not avail 
          you anything.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

, and blessings and peace be upon 
          the Messenger of Allaah, his family and companions, and those who follow 
          him.
 
          Recently we have started to hear people saying that Islam 
          can be divided into immutable matters and variables. But as far as we 
          know these phrases were never used by any of the scholars, because the 
          religion of Allaah is all immutable. The Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not die until Allaah had completed 
          the religion through him  and had established the rulings. So it 
          cannot be altered or changed until Allaah inherits the earth and everyone 
          on it. No one after the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) has the authority to alter or change anything. Allaah says 
          (interpretation of the meaning):
 
          “This day, I have perfected your religion for you, 
          completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your 
          religion”
 
          [al-Maa’idah 5:3]
 
          The religion, with its concessions and definitive rulings, 
          has been established and after the death of the Prophet SAWS (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) it cannot be altered; nothing can 
          be added or taken away: 
 
          “Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind 
          it, (it is) sent down by the All-Wise, Worthy of all praise (Allaah)”
 
          [Fussilat 41:42 – interpretation of the meaning]
 
          These words – immutable matters and variables – which 
          trip off the tongues of some seekers of knowledge may be abused by those 
          who follow their whims and desires who may try to change some rulings 
          which do not suit their wishes and desires.  Allaah says concerning 
          this (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “And if the truth had been in accordance with their 
          desires, verily, the heavens and the earth, and whosoever is therein 
          would have been corrupted!”
 
          [al-Mu’minoon 21:71]
 
          If these words which some students say may be interpreted 
          in any correct way, they would mean the ijtihaad of the scholars with 
          regard to matters concerning which no text has been narrated. For the 
          opinion of the mujtahid may change from time to time, according to the 
          evidence that is available to him and depending on the circumstances. 
          ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said, when his ijtihaad differed 
          concerning matters of inheritance, “At that time, that was our decision, 
          and this time this is our decision.” The ijtihaad of the mujtahid is 
          no more than his opinion, which cannot be said to be the ruling of Allaah; 
          rather it may coincide with the ruling of Allaah or it may go against 
          it. The opinion of everyone except the Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) may be accepted or rejected. The 
          opinions of the mujtahids cannot be divided into immutable matters and 
          variables because they are all open to being changed if it is proven 
          that they go against sound evidence. But the rulings of Allaah and His 
          religion cannot be changed or altered. So the seekers of knowledge must 
          be cautious in their speech and not say anything which opens the way 
          for those who follow their whims and desires and who promote false arguments, 
          because they (seekers of knowledge) are speaking with the words of the 
          scholars and what they say may be taken as evidence concerning matters 
          of religion. May Allaah grant us all knowledge and help us to do righteous 
          deeds. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.","Shaykh Saalih ibn Fawzaan al-Fawzaan, member of the Council of Senior Scholars and of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas"
13471,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13471,Can a Wife See Her Husband after Death?,"In case of death of a person, it is practiced by some groups of Muslims who follow Hanafi madhhab in India that the society forbids the wife of the person to see her own husband’s dead body. They claim that when a person dies, his wife becomes a widow and she should not be allowed to go in front of any (non-mahram) man who is dead or alive. It is assumed by them that her husband's dead body becomes haram to see. Is there any authentic hadith that confirms this? Please explain.","It is permissible for a woman to see her husband’s body after death and there is no reason why she should not. Indeed, a wife has the right to wash her dead husband.","Can the wife see husband after death?


Can women wail over the deceased?


Can the wife see her mahrams?","Praise be to Allah.Can the wife see husband after death?
It is permissible for a woman to see her husband’s body, and there is no reason why she should not. Indeed, a wife has the right to wash her dead husband . 
Imam Malik narrated in al-Muwatta from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Abi Bakr that Asma bint ‘Umays washed Abu Bakr al-Siddiq when he died, then she went out and asked the Muhajirin who were present, “I am fasting and the day is very cold; do I have to do ghusl?” and they said, “No.” (al-Janaiz, 466). 
The author of al-Muntaqa ‘ala Sharh al-Muwatta said concerning this hadith: 
“This indicates that it is permissible for a woman to wash her husband after he has died , because this happened in the presence of a number of the Companions, especially since Abu Bakr had left instructions in his will to that effect. No difference of opinion is known of among the Companions concerning this matter, which indicates that there was consensus.” 
`Aishah said, “If I could go back and change anything, nobody would have washed the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) except his wives .” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, al-Janaiz, 1453; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, no. 1196). If a woman is permitted to wash her husband’s body, then it is definitely permitted  for her to see her husband’s body. 
This ruling applies only if the woman is still within the `iddah period. If her `iddah period has ended, for example if she was pregnant but gave birth straight after her husband died, then it is not permissible for her to wash him or to see him. 
I (Shaykh al-Munajjid) asked Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) before he died about a man who dies and his wife gives birth a few hours later – can she wash her husband? 
He replied: “No, because when she gives birth the connection between her and her husband is severed, so it is not permissible for her to wash him, because he is now no longer her husband.” (Miah Faidah min al-‘Allamah al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (tape) 
Can women wail over the deceased?
What is forbidden is for women to wail over the deceased . It was narrated in a hadith that Umm ‘Atiyyah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took our pledge of allegiance to him on the grounds that we would not wail (over the dead). None of us fulfilled their promise except five women: Umm Sulaym, Umm al-‘Ala, the daughter of Abu Sabrah the wife of Mu'adh and two other women, or the daughter of Abu Sabrah, the wife of Mu’adh and one other woman.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari (al-Janaiz, 1223) 
Abu Malik al-Ash’ari narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are four things in my ummah from the jahiliyyah which they will not give up: pride in one’s ancestry, slandering the lineage of others, seeking rain from the stars and wailing over the dead. If the woman who wails does not repent before she dies, she will be raised on the Day of Resurrection wearing a garment of tar and a shirt of scabs.’ (Narrated by Muslim, al-Janaiz, 1550)
Can the wife see her mahrams?
It is permissible for a woman to see her mahrams , and she does not have to observe hijab in front of them . 
There is no connection between the death of a woman’s husband and her seeing her mahrams. Hence it is recommended for her mahrams to offer condolences to her, by them seeing her, shaking hands with her, sitting with her and talking to her. No dispute is known among the scholars concerning this.
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Al-Shafi`i and his companions said: it is recommended for all the relatives of the deceased to offer condolences to his wife , old and young, men and women, unless the wife is young, in which case only her mahrams should offer condolences.” (Al-Majmoo’, 5/277)
What the questioner describes is nothing more than the myths and ignorance of the common people. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a woman covering her face in front of her mahrams. He said: 
“That is not permissible, because it is not part of Islam; rather that is the myths and ignorance of the common people.” (See al-Fatawa al-Jami’ah li’l-Mar-ah al-Muslimah, part 2, p. 709)

13473,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13473,Who was al-Ghazzaali?,Could you shed some light on who Imam al Ghazzali was?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Al-Ghazzaali was Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad 
    al-Toosi, who was known as al-Ghazzaali. He was born in Toos in 450 AH. His 
    father used to spin wool and sell it in his shop in Toos. 

    The life of al-Ghazzaali needs to be discussed at length 
    because he went through a number of stages. He indulged in philosophy, then 
    he recanted and rejected that. After that he indulged in what is known as 
    ‘ilm al-kalaam (Islamic philosophy) and gained a sound grasp of its basic 
    principles; then he rejected that after it became clear to him that it was 
    corrupt and filled with contradictions. He was focusing on ‘ilm al-kalaam 
    during the period when he refuted philosophy, and at that time he was given 
    the title of Hujjat al-Islam, after he had refuted the arguments of the 
    philosophers. Then he recanted ‘ilm al-kalaam and turned away from it. He 
    followed the path of the Baatiniyyah (esotericists) and learned their 
    knowledge, but then he rejected that and showed the beliefs of the 
    Baatiniyyah to be false, and exposed the manner in which they tamper with 
    the texts and rulings. Then he followed the path of Sufism. These are the 
    four stages that al-Ghazzaali went through. Shaykh Abu ‘Umar ibn al-Salaah 
    (may Allaah have mercy on him) spoke well of him when he said: “A lot has 
    been said about Abu Haamid and a lot has been narrated from him. As for 
    these books – meaning al-Ghazzaali’s books which contradict the truth – no 
    attention should be paid to them. As for the man himself, we should keep 
    quiet about him, and refer his case to Allaah.” See Abu Haamid 
    al-Ghazzaali wa’l-Tasawwuf by ‘Abd al-Rahmaan Dimashqiyyah. 

    No fair-minded person would deny the rare level of 
    intelligence, ingenuity and cleverness that Abu Haamid al-Ghazzaali 
    attained. Al-Dhahabi said of him: “Al-Ghazzaali, the imaam and shaykh, the 
    prominent scholar, Hujjat al-Islam, the wonder of his time, Zayn al-Deem Abu 
    Haamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Toosi al-Shaafa’i 
    al-Ghazzaali, the author of many books and one possessed of utter 
    intelligence. He studied fiqh in his own town, then he moved to Nisapur in 
    the company of a group of students. He stayed with the Imaam al-Haramayn and 
    gained a deep knowledge of fiqh within a short period. He became well-versed 
    in ‘ilm al-kalaam and debate, until he became the best of debaters…” (Siyar 
    A’laam al-Nubala’, part 9, p. 323) 

    You will find that even though Abu Haamid al-Ghazzaali had 
    such a deep knowledge of fiqh, Sufism, ‘ilm al-kalaam, usool al-fiqh, etc., 
    and even though he was such an ascetic and devoted worshipper, and had such 
    a good intention and vast knowledge of Islamic sciences, he still had an 
    inclination towards philosophy. But his philosophy emerged in the form of 
    Sufism and was expressed through Islamic ideas. Hence the Muslim scholars, 
    including his closest companion Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi, refuted his ideas. 
    Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi said: Our shaykh Abu Haamid went deep into 
    philosophy, then he wanted to come out of it but he was unable to. There 
    were narrated from him opinions which sound like the Baatini way of 
    speaking, and that may be verified by looking in al-Ghazzaali’s books. See
    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, part 4, p. 66. 

    Even though al-Ghazzaali was very advanced in knowledge, he 
    had little knowledge of hadeeth and its sciences, and he could not 
    distinguish between sound ahaadeeth and weak ones. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn 
    Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “If we assume that someone 
    narrated the view of the salaf but what he narrated is far removed from what 
    the view of the salaf actually is, then he has little knowledge of the view 
    of the salaf, such as Abu’l-Ma’aali, Abu Haamid al-Ghazzaali, Ibn al-Khateeb 
    and the like, who did not have enough knowledge of hadeeth to qualify them 
    as ordinary scholars of hadeeth, let alone as prominent scholars in that 
    field. For none of these people had any knowledge of al-Bukhaari and Muslim 
    and their ahaadeeth, apart from what they heard, which is similar to the 
    situation of the ordinary Muslim, who cannot distinguish between a hadeeth 
    which is regarded as saheeh and mutawaatir according to the scholars of 
    hadeeth, and a hadeeth which is fabricated and false. Their books bear 
    witness to that, for they contain strange things and most of these scholars 
    of ‘ilm al-kalaam and Sufis who have drifted away from the path of the salaf 
    admit that, either at the time of death or before death. There are many such 
    well-known stories. This Abu Haamid al-Ghazzaali, despite his brilliance, 
    his devotion to Allaah, his knowledge of kalaam and philosophy, his 
    asceticism and spiritual practices and his Sufism, ended up in a state of 
    confusion and resorted to the path of those who claim to find out things 
    through dreams and spiritual methods. (Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, part 4, p. 
    71). 

    He also said: Hence, even though Abu Haamid refuted the 
    philosophers and classed them as kaafirs, and expressed veneration of 
    Prophethood [as opposed to philosophy], etc., and even though some of what 
    he says is true and good, and indeed of great benefit, nevertheless some of 
    his writings contain philosophical material and matters where he followed 
    the corrupt principles of philosophy that contradict Prophethood and even 
    contradict sound common sense. Hence a group of scholars from Khurasaan, 
    Iraq and the Maghreb criticized him, such as his friend Abu Ishaaq 
    al-Margheenaani, Abu’l-Wafa’ ibn ‘Aqeel, al-Qushayri, al-Tartooshi, Ibn 
    Rushd, al-Maaziri and a group of earlier scholars. This was even mentioned 
    by Shaykh Abu ‘Amr ibn al-Salaah in his book Tabaqaat Ashaab al-Shaafa’i, 
    and was confirmed by Shaykh Abu Zakariya al-Nawawi, who said in his book: 
    “Chapter explaining some important things for which Imaam al-Ghazzaali was 
    denounced in his books which were unacceptable to the scholars of his 
    madhhab and others, namely his odd statements such as what he said in 
    Muqaddimat al-Mantiq at the beginning of al-Mustasfa: ‘This is the 
    introduction to all knowledge, and whoever does not learn this, his 
    knowledge cannot be trusted at all.’” 

    Shaykh Abu ‘Amr said: “I heard Shaykh al-‘Imaad ibn Yoonus 
    narrating from Yoosuf al-Dimashqi, the teacher of al-Nizaamiyyah in Baghdad, 
    who was one of the famous deans of the school, that he used to denounce 
    these words and say, “Abu Bakr and ‘Umar and So-and-so and So-and-so…” 
    meaning that these great leaders had a great deal of certainty and faith 
    even though they had no knowledge of this Muqaddimah and of any of 
    the ideas contained in it.” (al-‘Aqeedah al-Isfahaaniyyah, part 1, p. 
    169). 

    Al-Dhahabi narrated in his book Siyar A’laam al-Nubala’ 
    that Muhammad ibn al-Waleed al-Tartooshi said in a letter which he sent to 
    Ibn Muzaffar: As for what you mentioned about Abu Haamid, I have seen him 
    and spoken to him, and I think that he is a man of great knowledge, he is 
    intelligent and capable, and has been studying all of his life, spending 
    most of his time in study, but then he drifted away from the path of the 
    scholars and entered the crowd of worshippers. Then he became a Sufi and 
    forsook knowledge and its people, then he got involved with “inspiration”, 
    those who claim to have spiritual knowledge, and the insinuating whispers of 
    the Shaytaan. Then he mixed that with the views of the philosophers and the 
    symbolic phrases of al-Hallaaj, and he started to criticize the fuqaha’ and 
    the scholars of ‘ilm al-kalaam. He almost went astray from the religion 
    altogether. When he wrote al-Ihya’ [i.e., Ihya’ ‘Uloom al-Deen], 
    he started to speak of the inspiration and symbolic words of the Sufis, 
    although he was not qualified to do that and had no deep knowledge of such 
    matters. Hence he failed, and filled his book with fabricated reports. 

    I (al-Dhahabi) say: as for al-Ihya’, it contains many 
    false ahaadeeth, and it contains much that is good. I wish that it did not 
    contain etiquette, rituals and asceticism that are in accordance with the 
    ways of the philosophers and deviant Sufis. We ask Allaah for beneficial 
    knowledge. Do you know what is beneficial knowledge? It is that which Allaah 
    revealed in the Qur’aan, which was explained by the Messenger  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in word and deed, and the type of 
    knowledge which we are not forbidden to acquire. The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever turns away from my Sunnah 
    does not belong to me.” So, my brother, you must ponder the words of Allaah 
    and persist in studying al-Saheehayn, Sunan al-Nasaa’i, 
    Riyaadh al-Nawawi and al-Adhkaar by al-Nawawi, then you will 
    succeed and prosper. 
Beware of the opinions of 
    the philosophers, the practice of spiritual exercises, the starvation of 
    monks, and the nonsense talk of those who stay alone for long periods in 
    their monasteries. All goodness is to be found in following the pure and 
    tolerant way of the haneefs. And seek the help of Allaah. O Allaah, guide us 
    to Your straight path. 

    Al-Maaziri praised Abu Haamid with regard to fiqh, and said 
    that he had more knowledge of fiqh than of usool al-fiqh (the basic 
    principles of fiqh). With regard to ‘ilm al-kalaam which is usool al-deen, 
    he wrote books in this field, but he did not have deep knowledge of it. I 
    realized that he was lacking in experience in this field, because he studied 
    the branches of philosophy before he studied usool al-fiqh, so philosophy 
    made him audacious in criticizing ideas and attacking facts, because 
    philosophy goes along with one’s train of thought, without any shar’i 
    guidelines. 

    A friend of his told me that he spent a lot of time studying
    Rasaa’il Ikhwaan al-Safa, which contains fifty-one essays. It was 
    written by someone who has studied sharee’ah and philosophy, then had mixed 
    the two. He was a man who was known as Ibn Seena, who filled the world with 
    his books. He had a good knowledge of philosophy, which led him to try to 
    refer all the basic principles of ‘aqeedah to philosophy. He strove hard and 
    achieved what others had failed to do. I have seen some of his books and I 
    noticed that Abu Haamid quotes him a great deal when he speaks of 
    philosophy. With regard to Sufi views, I do not know where he got them from, 
    but I have seen that some of his companions mention the books of Ibn Seena 
    and their contents, and he also mentioned the books of Abu Hayyaan 
    al-Tawheedi. As far as I am concerned, he picked up his Sufi ideas from him. 
    I was told that Abu Hayyaan wrote a huge book about these Sufi ideas, and 
    al-Ihya’ contains a lot of baseless ideas… then he said: In al-Ihya’ 
    he mentioned ideas that have no basis, such as starting with the index 
    finger when cutting the nails because it is superior to the other fingers, 
    as it is the finger used in tasbeeh; then moving on to the middle finger 
    because it is to the right of the index finger, and ending with the thumb of 
    the right hand. He narrated a report concerning that. 

    I (al-Dhahabi) say: this is a fabricated report. Abu’l-Faraj 
    al-Jawzi said: Abu Haamid wrote al-Ihya’ and filled it with 
    fabricated ahaadeeth which he did not know were fabricated. He spoke of 
    inspiration and deviated from the framework of fiqh. He said that what is 
    meant by the stars, moon and sun that Ibraaheem saw was the barriers of 
    light that keep a person from Allaah, not the things that are well known. 
    This is like the words of the Baatiniyyah.

    (Siyar A’laam al-Nubala’, part 19, p. 340). 

    Then at the end of his life, al-Ghazzaali (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him) came back to the belief of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah. He 
    focused on the Qur’aan and Sunnah and condemned ‘ilm al-kalaam and its 
    proponents. He advised the ummah to come back to the Book of Allaah and the 
    Sunnah of His Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), 
    and to act in accordance with them, as was the way of the Sahaabah (may 
    Allaah be pleased with them and those who follow them in truth until the Day 
    of Judgement). Shaykh al-Islam (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: After 
    that he came back to the path of the scholars of hadeeth, and wrote 
    Iljaam al-‘Awwaam ‘an ‘Ilm al-Kalaam.

    (Majmoo Fataawa, part 4, p. 72) 

    A glance at Iljaam al-‘Awwaam ‘an ‘Ilm al-Kalaam will 
    prove to us that he had indeed changed in many ways: 
1 – In this book he 
    advocated the belief of the salaf, and pointed out that the way of the salaf 
    was the truth, and that whoever went against them was an innovator or 
    follower of bid’ah. 

    2 – He emphatically denounced ta’weel (interpretation of the 
    attributes of Allaah in a manner that differs from their apparent meaning). 
    He advocated affirming the attributes of Allaah and not misinterpreting them 
    in a manner that would lead to denying the attributes of Allaah. 

    3 – He emphatically denounced the scholars of ‘ilm al-kalaam 
    and described all their principles and standards as “reprehensible 
    innovations” which had harmed a great number of people and created trouble 
    for the Muslims. He said: “The harm caused to a great number of people is 
    something that has been seen, witnessed and experienced. The evil that has 
    resulted since ‘ilm al-kalaam began has become widespread even though people 
    at the time of the Sahaabah forbade that. This is also indicated by the fact 
    that the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the 
    Sahaabah, by consensus, did not follow the way of the scholars of ‘ilm 
    al-kalaam when they produced arguments and evidence and analysis. That was 
    not because they were incapable of doing so; if they had thought that was 
    something good, they would have done it in the best manner, and they would 
    have studied the matter hard, more than they did with regard to the division 
    of the estate among the heirs (al-faraa’id).”

     He also said: “The Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with 
    them) needed to prove the Prophethood of Muhammad  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) to the Jews and Christians, but they did not add 
    anything to the evidence of the Qur’aan; they did not resort to arguments or 
    lay down philosophical principles. That was because they knew that doing so 
    would provoke trouble and cause confusion. Whoever is not convinced by the 
    evidence of the Qur’aan will not be convinced by anything other than the 
    sword, for there is no proof after the proof of Allaah.”

     See Abu Haamid al-Ghazzaali wa’l-Tasawwuf.

     These are a few of the comments that trustworthy scholars 
    have made about al-Ghazzaali (may Allaah have mercy on him). Perhaps this is 
    enough for those who wish to be guided. And Allaah is the Guide to the 
    straight path.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
13474,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13474,Status of the imam in Islam,"Is it appropriate for a paid Imam to be the director of the Masjid at the same time? In other word, conflict of interest, please explain.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is no reason why the imam should not be the director of the mosque at the same time, even if he gets a monthly salary. The imam of the mosque is the one who is responsible for the mosque; his role is not restricted only to leading the prayers, because the imaam in the mosque is like the sultan in his sultanate – unless he cannot manage the mosque properly or he is too busy and cannot take care of all the things he needs to, in which case there is no reason why another man should not be appointed to take care of mosque administration, so long as that is with the imaam’s agreement. Or duties may be shared among some of the worshippers. 
Leadership (imaamah) in Islam.
Note, may Allaah bless you, that the position of leadership is a divinely ordained system through which Allaah gives us practical guidelines to achieve noble aims and lofty purposes, such as worshipping Him well and following the leaders in cases of jihad. Hence the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the way of all the Rightly-Guided khaleefahs and those Umawi (Umayyad) and ‘Abbaasi (Abassid) rulers who followed their path was that the leader would also be an imam or leader of prayers and of jihad. Whenever the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent a commander in war, he would lead the prayers too, and if he appointed a man as a governor over a city – as when he appointed ‘Ataab ibn Usayd (may Allaah be pleased with him) to govern Makkah and ‘Uthmaan ibn Abi’l-‘Aas (may Allaah be pleased with him) to govern al-Taa’if, and ‘Ali and Mu’aadh and Abu Moosa (may Allaah be pleased with them) to govern Yemen, and ‘Amr ibn Hazm (may Allaah be pleased with him) to govern Najraan – the person whom he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) appointed would lead them in prayers and carry out hudood punishments amongst them. This was also the practice of the khulafa’ who came after him and those who succeeded them, namely the Umawis and some of the ‘Abbasis, because the most important matters of religion are prayer and jihad. 
With regard to the imam’s role in society, there is no doubt that it is an important role. How can it be otherwise when he is leading the prayers which are the most important pillar of Islam after the Shahaadatayn (twin testimony of faith)? The imam is the leader and the worshippers behind him are his followers. The imam guides and leads his jamaa’ah (group) by giving lessons and talks. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the Rightly-Guided khaleefahs used to hold gatherings in the mosques where the Muslims would gather so that they might consult with one another concerning religious and worldly matters and so that they might teach the people about Tawheed, fiqh, good manners, and also enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil.” 
See Ahkaam al-Imaamah wa’l-I’timaam fi’l-Salaah by al-Muneef, p. 64 
The imam should check up on those who are absent (from the prayers), and visit the sick, He should strive to meet the needs of the Muslims who pray with him, teaching the ignorant, admonishing the negligent, advising the erring, reconciling those among whom there are differences, bringing them closer to one another and striving to foster friendship and love between them. He should strive to solve social problems that arise among them such as family quarrels, disputes between neighbours and the like. To sum up, the role of the imam is very important and should be appreciated as such. The group should help him to achieve the aims of sharee’ah and ward off anything that is bad or harmful. And Allaah is the Source of strength.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
13475,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13475,"She is asking about myths concerning getting married between the two Eids, and what is wrong with that according to sharee’ah","my question is that here in Asia most of the people think that if we got marry between two eids i mean EID-UL-FITAR  till EID-UL-AZHA so it is very bad and one of the pair mean birde or groom die because it is not good to marry between two EIDS ,i want to know whether it is right or wrong from Islamic point of view ,i know that there are large numbers of question asked but you can also post the answer to this question in your site it will be very useful InshAllahtala because many people even being muslim have very strong believe that these things are true as far as i know there is nothing in Islam  like this and it is wrong but i want more detail so that i could tell other people also you wrote that one should not fast or pray specially beacause it is 15 Shaban  and the sawab will be greater but if it is his rotine than he or she can ,here where i am livin muslims are very careful about this day and they fast and pray for Almighty Allah j and tell that it is very sawab and it is in Ahadis sharif and when i told them about your article they told me that no there are Ahadis sharif about the greatness of this day.",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          With regard to the first question: 
 
          The answer is in two parts. Firstly, the belief mentioned 
          in the question is not correct; it is a kind of innovation and misguidance 
          which has no basis in sharee’ah, and is not indicated by the Qur’aan 
          or Sunnah. 
 
          Secondly, this belief goes against the sharee’ah of Islam 
          in several ways: 
 
          (i)The belief that someone 
          will die during this period. It is not permissible to believe this because 
          death and life are in the hand of Allaah and the appointed time of man’s 
          death is something of which Allaah has kept the knowledge to Himself. 
          No one among mankind knows when he will die. This is something which 
          Allaah has not told to any of His creation. Hence the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, in the hadeeth whose 
          authenticity is agreed upon which was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may 
          Allaah be pleased with him), in the lengthy hadeeth of Jibreel: “There 
          are five things which no one knows except Allaah.” Then he recited the 
          verse (interpretation of the meaning):
 
          “Verily, Allaah, with Him (Alone) is the knowledge 
          of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the 
          wombs. No person knows what he will earn tomorrow, and no person knows 
          in what land he will die. Verily, Allaah is All-Knower, All-Aware 
          (of things”
 
          [Luqmaan 31:34]
 
          (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 48; Muslim, 10)
 
          Claiming that marrying during this period will lead to 
          death is a claim to have knowledge of the unseen, and everyone who claims 
          to have knowledge of the unseen is lying. Hence the leaders of falsehood 
          are those who claim to have some knowledge of the unseen. 
 
          (ii)This also undermines faith, 
          because it implies a lack of belief in the Divine will and decree (al-qadaa’ 
          wa’l-qadar). Hence the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught Ibn ‘Abbaas, when 
          he was a boy, “Know that if the nation were to gather together to benefit 
          you in any way, they would not be able to benefit you in any way except 
          that which Allaah had decreed for you, and if they were to gather together 
          to do you harm in any way, they would not be able to harm you except 
          that which Allaah had decreed for you. The pens have been lifted and 
          the pages have dried.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, Sifat al-Qiyaamah, 
          2440; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 
          no. 2043). It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas said: 
          “I heard the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, ‘Allaah decreed the 
          fate of His creatures fifty thousand years before He created the heavens 
          and the earth.’” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Qadar, 4797)
 
          (iii)It also undermines Tawheed 
          and its perfection, because it involves regarding something as an evil 
          omen and pessimism. It says in the hadeeth narrated from Abu Hurayrah 
          (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no ‘adwaa 
          [contagion, transmission of infectious disease without the permission 
          of Allaah], no tiyarah [superstitious belief in bird omens], no haamah 
          [refers to a Jaahili Arab tradition described variously as: a worm which 
          infests the grave of a murder victim until he is avenged; an owl; or 
          the bones of a dead person turned into a bird that could fly], and no 
          Safar [the month of Safar was regarded as “unlucky” during the Jaahiliyyah].”
 
          (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Tibb, 5316)
 
          Tatayyur (superstitious belief in bad omens) means pessimism. 
          It was narrated in the hadeeth of Ibn Mas’ood that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Tiyarah (believing 
          in evil omens) is a kind of shirk.” 
 
          (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, al-Siyar, 1539; classed 
          as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, no. 1314) 
 
          It should be noted that superstitious belief in bad omens 
          contradicts Tawheed in two ways: 
 
          Firstly, superstitious belief prevents one from putting 
          one’s trust in Allaah and makes one depend on someone other than Him.
 
          Secondly, it causes people to depend on things that have 
          no basis in reality, for there is no connection between getting married 
          in this month and whatever may happen subsequently. Undoubtedly this 
          undermines Tawheed, because Tawheed means worship and seeking help. 
          Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for 
          help (for each and everything).”[al-Faatihah 1:5]
 
          and: 
 
          “So worship Him (O Muhammad) and put your trust in 
          Him”
 
          [Hood 11:123]
 
          Hence ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) used 
          to say that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married her in Shawwaal 
          and consummated the marriage with her in Shawwaal and she was the dearest 
          and most beloved of his wives to him. The Arabs used to regard this 
          month as inauspicious and they used to say that if a person got married 
          in Shawwaal, the marriage would not succeed, but this is not true. 
 
          In the case of one who believes in evil omens, one of 
          two things must apply: 
 
          Either he will give up, respond to the “bad omen”, and 
          not take action, which is the worst kind of superstition and pessimism, 
          or he will go ahead, but he will be anxious and worried, fearing that 
          he will be affected by this bad omen. This is less serious, but both 
          detract from Tawheed and adversely affect people. (See al-Qawl al-Mufeed 
          by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, part 2, p. 77-78) 
 
          In practical terms, we see that the saheeh Sunnah of 
          the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prove that this myth is 
          false, for the best of mankind, Muhammad 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), got married to the most 
          beloved of people to him, namely ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with 
          her), and his marriage to her took place between the two Eids, and she 
          was one of the happiest of people with him. Indeed, she herself refuted 
          this jaahili claim by saying, “The Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married me in Shawwaal and 
          he consummated the marriage with me in Shawwaal, and which of the wives 
          of the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was dearer to him than me?” 
 
          ‘Urwah ibn al-Zubayr said: ‘Aa’ishah used to like marriages 
          to be consummated in Shawwaal. (Narrated by Muslim, 1423) 
 
          Al-Nawawi said: 
 
          This shows that it is mustahabb to arrange marriages, get married and 
          consummate marriages in Shawwaal. Our companions stated that it is mustahabb, 
          and they quoted this hadeeth as evidence. By saying this, ‘Aa’ishah 
          intended to refute the practice and belief of the jaahiliyyah. What 
          some of the common people believe nowadays, that it is disliked to arrange 
          marriages, get married and consummate marriages in Shawwaal, is false 
          and has no basis. This is one of the leftovers of the jaahiliyyah. They 
          used to regard that as inauspicious because of the fact that the name 
          Shawwaal carries connotations of lifting. 
 
          Sharh Muslim, 9/209 
 
          Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
 
          ‘Aa’ishah the Mother of the Believers (may Allaah be 
          pleased with her) regarded it as mustahabb for a woman to be married 
          or the marriage to be consummated  with her in Shawwaal. She said, 
          “The Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) only married me in Shawwaal, 
          and which of his wives was more beloved to him than me?” even though 
          the people regarded marriage in Shawwaal as inauspicious This is something 
          which the believers who truly put their trust in Allaah and whose hearts 
          truly find contentment with their Lord should resolve to do, those who 
          know that what Allaah wills will happen and what He does not will will 
          not happen, and that nothing will befall them except that which Allaah 
          has decreed, and that no calamity will befall them except that which 
          was already written in the Book before they were created, who know that 
          they will inevitably come to that which has been decreed for them, which 
          must inevitably happen to them. If they are superstitious, this will 
          not ward off the decree from them, rather their superstition will be 
          one of the main reasons why what they fear of the Divine will and decree 
          will come to them. Thus their fear will be the means of bringing what 
          they fear upon them. So according to the will and decree of Allaah, 
          their weakness of faith will be the cause of what they dislike happening 
          to them, so their bad omen is with themselves.  But those who put 
          their trust in Allaah, who delegate their affairs to Him, who know Him 
          and His commands, their souls are more noble than that and their interests 
          more sublime. Their trust in Allaah and their positive thoughts of Him 
          give them power, strength and protection  against the things which

13478,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13478,Are the compilation of the Qur’aan and the first adhaan for Jumu’ah forms of bid’ah (innovation)?,if bidah is wrong· then what about the quran being compiled? and other things such as umar introducing something in the azan? please make this clear as some people say good bidah is allowed· relating it to one of the prophets hadith?,,,"Praise be to Allah.For a correct definition of bid’ah and guidelines concerning it, please see Questions no. 864, 205, 10843. 
With regard to what you mention about Abu Bakr compiling the Qur’aan, this is not bid’ah, rather it is Sunnah such as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined us to adhere to when he said: “I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly-Guided khaleefahs after me.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2676; Abu Dawood, 4607; Ibn Maajah, 42. This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi, by al-Haakim, 1/177; and by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 2549, from the hadeeth of al-‘Irbaad ibn Saariyah). This is one of the Sunnahs of the Rightly-Guided Khaleefah Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with him). 
Bid’ah means seeking to draw close to Allaah by means of acts of worship for which there is no precedent (in sharee’ah). The Qur’aan was compiled in people’s hearts and it was compiled on tablets kept by some of the Sahaabah. Compiling all of it in one place or on one tablet does not involve anything that is to be denounced. 
Zayd ibn Thaabit said – when Abu Bakr delegated him to collect the Mus-haf – I sought the Qur’aan and I gathered it from pieces, i.e., leaves, patches of leather, shoulder-blades of sheep and camels, leaves of palm trees, and the hearts of men. 
Al-Qaadi Abu Bakr al-Baaqillaani mentioned the justification for the action of Abu Bakr, the five most important points of which were: 
1 – That the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not do that for a reason, and Abu Bakr did it because there was a need for it. 
2 – Allaah referred in the Qur’aan to al-Suhuf al-Oola (the former Scriptures – al-A’laa 89:19], and He stated that Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had something similar in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning]:  
“reciting (the Qur’aan) purified pages [purified from Al-Baatil (falsehood)].
Wherein are correct and straight laws from Allaah”
[al-Bayyinah 98:2-3]
So this [action of Abu Bakr] was following that which was prescribed by Allaah and His Messenger. 
3 – By doing that, their intention was to fulfil the words of Allaah: 
“Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur’aan) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)”
[al-Hijr 15:9]
It was preserved with Him, and He told us that He would preserve it after it had been sent down. Part of His preserving it was His enabling the Sahaabah to gather it and to agree upon how its spelling and punctuation were to be regulated.
4 – The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had scribes to whom he dictated it, so that everyone would understand from this that it should be written down and preserved on sheets. If Allaah’s guarantee to preserve it meant that the ummah would have nothing to do with it, the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would not have had it written down after Allaah had told him of His guarantee to preserve it. But it is known that the way in which Allaah has preserved it is by causing us to preserve it and making that easy for us, and showing us how it is to be written down. 
5 – It is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade traveling with the Qur’aan to the land of the enemy. This indicates that it was written down and that the people used to take it with them when they travelled. 
Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi said: this is the clearest evidence for anyone who studies the issue.                                                                  
See Ahkaam al-Qur’aan, 2/612 
With regard to your saying that ‘Umar added “something new” to the adhaan, we know nothing of that. But perhaps you were referring to the fact that ‘Uthmaan added the first call to the Jumu’ah prayers. This is correct, because at the time of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), there was just one adhaan, but when ‘Uthmaan became khaleefah and Madeenah became larger, ‘Uthmaan thought that the call for Jumu’ah should be given before the time, so the people could get ready for the prayer. This is what is called the first adhaan.
It was narrated that al-Saa’ib ibn Yazeed said: At the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, the first call on Friday used to be when the imaam was sitting on the minbar. But at the time of ‘Uthmaan (may Allaah be pleased with him), when the number of people increased, he added the third call. According to one report, ‘Uthmaan gave orders for the first call. According to another report, the second adhaan was enjoined by ‘Uthmaan. There is no contradiction here, because it is called the third call in the sense that it was something added; the first in the sense that it comes before the adhaan and iqaamah; and the second in the sense that this is an adhaan given in addition to the real adhaan, which was given in al-Zawraa’. Abu ‘Abd-Allaah – i.e., al-Bukhaari – said that al-Zawraa’ was a place in the market of Madeenah.
 Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 870. 
This adhaan is not a bid’ah or reprehensible innovation, rather it is one of the Sunnahs of the Rightly-Guided Khaleefah ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan (may Allaah be pleased with him), which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) urged us to adhere to when he said: “I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly-Guided khaleefahs after me.” 
Moreover there is a sound reason behind it, which is to alert the people to the fact that the time of prayer is at hand. And it is worth noting that there are no rulings attached to this (first) adhaan, such as the prohibition on buying or selling or the obligation to go to the mosque, and that ‘Uthmaan was wise to have this call made in the marketplace and not in the mosque. This is no more than an alert to the people, to let them know that the time for prayer is at hand, because the houses were far away and far from one another, as mentioned above. 
Hence it was narrated that ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) did not do that in Kufa because there was no need for it.

13479,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13479,Zakah on shares for resale with specification of gain (murabahah),"I have an account with one of the investment companies. This company deals with Islamic investments (silent partnerships (mudaarabah) – rentals – resales with specification of gains (muraabahah)), whereby it collects money and invests it in business, real estate, industrial or agricultural projects within the Kingdom (Saudi Arabia) or in Muslim countries, in order to serve Islam and the Muslims. They give us the profits annually in the form of these shares. My question is: should I pay the annual zakah on my wealth based on the capital which I paid to this company, or on the profits which I take annually, and what is the rate of zakah that I have to pay?",,,"Praise be to Allah.With regard to the mudaarabah and muraabahah shares, you should pay zakah on both the principle and the profits, when one full year has passed on the capital. With regard to the shares which are held in agricultural, real estate and industrial companies, zakah is due on the profits if they reach the nisaab (minimum amount) on their own or when added to others, and one full (hijri) year has passed. The rate of zakah is one quarter of one tenth, i.e., 2.5 %. With regard to the shares, zakah is not due on them if they are not available for sale. But if they are available for sale then zakah must be paid on them and their profits when one full (hijri) year has passed, as with all other trade goods. If the agricultural company produces grains, dates or grapes then the prescribed zakah must be paid on them if the amount of each of them reaches five wasq or more.

13480,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13480,Virtues of Ramadan,What are the virtues of Ramadan?,"Virtues of Ramadan include the following: 1- Allah has made fasting this month the fourth pillar of Islam. 2- Allah revealed the Quran in this month. 3- Allah has blessed Ramadan with Laylat al-Qadr . 4- In this month, Allah opens the gates of Paradise and closes the gates of Hell. 5-Every night Allah has people whom He redeems from the Fire.  6- Fasting Ramadan is a means of expiation for the sins committed since the previous Ramadan.",,"Praise be to Allah.Ramadan is one of the twelve Arabic months. It is a month which is venerated in the Islamic religion, and it is distinguished from the other months by a number of characteristics and virtues, including the following: 
1- Allah has made fasting this month the fourth pillar of Islam , as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong). So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Sawm (fasts) that month…” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
And it was narrated in al-Sahihayn (al-Bukhari, 8; Muslim, 16) from the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Islam is built on five (pillars): the testimony that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) is the Messenger of Allah; establishing prayer; paying zakah; fasting Ramadan; and Hajj to the House (the Ka’bah).” 
2- Allah revealed the Quran in this month, as He says in the verse quoted above (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong)…” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, We have sent it (this Quran) down in the Night of Al-Qadr (Decree).” [al-Qadr 97:1]
3- Allah has made Laylat al-Qadr in this month, which is better than a thousand months, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, We have sent it (this Quran) down in the Night of Al-Qadr (Decree). And what will make you know what the Night of Al-Qadr (Decree) is? The Night of Al-Qadr (Decree) is better than a thousand months (i.e. worshipping Allah in that night is better than worshipping Him a thousand months, i.e. 83 years and 4 months). Therein descend the angels and the Ruh [Jibreel (Gabriel)] by Allah’s Permission with all Decrees, (All that night), there is peace (and goodness from Allah to His believing slaves) until the appearance of dawn.” [al-Qadar 97:1-5] 
“We sent it (this Quran) down on a blessed night [(i.e. the Night of Al-Qadr) in the month of Ramadan — the 9th month of the Islamic calendar]. Verily, We are ever warning [mankind that Our Torment will reach those who disbelieve in Our Oneness of Lordship and in Our Oneness of worship].” [al-Dukhan 44:3]
Allah has blessed Ramadan with Laylat al-Qadr . Explaining the great status of this blessed night, Surat al-Qadr was revealed, and there are many ahadith which also speak of that, such as the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There has come to you Ramadan, a blessed month which Allah has enjoined you to fast, during which the gates of heaven are opened and the gates of Hell are closed, and the rebellious devils are chained up. In it there is a night which is better than a thousand months, and whoever is deprived of its goodness is indeed deprived.” (Narrated by al-Nasai, 2106; Ahmad, 8769, classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Targhib, 999.)
And Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever spends Laylat al-Qadr in prayer out of faith and in the hope of reward, will be forgiven his previous sins.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1910; Muslim, 760)
4- Allah has made fasting Ramadan and spending its nights in prayer out of faith and in the hope of reward a means of forgiveness of sins, as was proven in al-Sahihayn (al-Bukhari, 2014; Muslim, 760) from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever fasts Ramadan out of faith and in the hope of reward, his previous sins will be forgiven.” 
Al-Bukhari (2008) and Muslim (174) also narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever spends the nights of Ramadan in prayer out of faith and in the hope of reward, his previous sins will be forgiven.” 
The Muslims are unanimously agreed that it is Sunnah to pray qiyam at night in Ramadan. Al-Nawawi said that what is meant by praying qiyam in Ramadan is to pray Tarawih, i.e., one achieves what is meant by qiyam by praying Tarawih. 
5- In this month, Allah opens the gates of Paradise and closes the gates of Hell , and chains up the devils, as is stated in al-Sahihayn (al-Bukhari, 1898; Muslim, 1079), from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Ramadan comes, the gates of Paradise are opened and the gates of Hell are closed, and the devils are chained up.” 
6- Every night Allah has people whom He redeems from the Fire. Imam Ahmad (5/256) narrated from the hadith of Abu Umamah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “At every breaking of the fast, Allah has people whom He redeems.” Al-Mundhiri said: there is nothing wrong with its isnad; and it was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Targhib, 987. 
Al-Bazzar (Kashf 962) narrated that Abu Sa’id said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has people whom He redeems every day and night – i.e., in Ramadan – and every Muslim every day and night has a prayer that is answered.” 
7- Fasting Ramadan is a means of expiation for the sins committed since the previous Ramadan, so long as one avoids major sins. It was proven in Sahih Muslim (233) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The five daily prayers, from one Jumu’ah to the next and from one Ramadan to the next are expiation for (sins committed) in between, so long as you avoid major sins.” 
8- Fasting in Ramadan is equivalent to fasting ten months, as is indicated by the hadith in Sahih Muslim (1164) narrated from Abu Ayyub al-Ansari: “Whoever fasts Ramadan then follows it with six days of Shawwal , it will be like fasting for a lifetime.”
Ahmad (21906) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever fasts Ramadan, a month is like ten months, and fasting six days after al-Fitr will complete the year.” 
9- Whoever prays qiyam in Ramadan with the imam until he finishes, it will be recorded for him that he spent the whole night in prayer, because of the report narrated by Abu Dawud (1370) and others from the hadith of Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays qiyam with the imam until he finishes, it will be recorded for him that he spent the whole night in prayer.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Salat al-Tarawih, p. 15)
10- ‘Umrah in Ramadan is equivalent to Hajj . Al-Bukhari (1782) and Muslim (1256) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to a woman among the Ansar, “What kept you from doing Hajj with us?” She said, “We only had two camels that we used for bringing water.” So her husband and son had gone for Hajj on one camel, and he left the other for them to use for bringing water.” He said, “When Ramadan comes, go for ‘Umrah, for ‘Umrah in Ramadan is equivalent to Hajj.” According to a report narrated by Muslim, “… is equivalent to doing Hajj with me.” 
11- It is Sunnah to observe i’tikaf (retreat for the purpose of worship) in Ramadan, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) always did that, as it was narrated in the hadith of ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to spend the last ten days of Ramadan in i'tikaf until he passed away, then his wives observed i'tikaf after him.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1922; Muslim, 1172. 
12- It is mustahabb in the sense of being strongly recommended in Ramadan to study the Quran together and to read it a great deal. You may study the Quran together by reciting it to someone else and by having someone else recite it to you. The evidence that this is mustahabb is the fact that Jibril used to meet the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) every night in Ramadan and study the Quran with him. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6; Muslim, 2308)
Reading Quran is mustahabb in general, but more so in Ramadan. 
13- It is mustahabb in Ramadan to offer iftar to those who are fasting , because of the hadith of Zayd ibn Khalid al-Juhani (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever gives iftar to one who is fasting will have a reward like his, without that detracting from the fasting person’s reward in the slightest.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 807; Ibn Majah, 1746; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 647.)

13482,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13482,Establishing another jamaa’ah in the mosque,"Some brothers come late when the first jamaa’ah (congregation) has finished, so they pray in a second jamaa’ah with a different imam.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This is the issue of establishing a second jamaa’ah in the mosque. The Standing Committee (7/309) was asked about the ruling on establishing a second jamaa’ah in the mosque and replied: 
Whoever comes to the mosque and finds that the jamaa’ah has prayed with the regular imam or another imam, should pray in jamaa’ah with others like him who also missed the (first) jamaa’ah, or some of those who have already prayed should do him the favour of praying with him, because of the hadeeth narrated by Ahmad in his Musnad, and by Abu Dawood in his Sunan, from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw a man praying by himself and said, “Won’t someone do this man a favour and pray with him?” So a man got up and prayed with him. Al-Tirmidhi also narrated this from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him), but he said, “So a man came and prayed with him.” 
Al-Tirmidhi said: (it is) a hasan hadeeth. It was also narrated and classed as saheeh by al-Haakim, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. It was also narrated by Ibn Hazm in al-Muhalla, and he indicated that it is saheeh. 
Abu ‘Eesa al-Tirmidhi said: This is the view of more than one of the Sahaabah and Taabi’een. They said: there is nothing wrong with people praying in congregation in a mosque in which a congregational prayer has already been offered. This was also the view of Ahmad and Ishaaq. 
Others said that they should pray individually. This was the view of Sufyaan, Ibn al-Mubaarak, Maalik and al-Shaafa’i. End quote. 
They and those who agreed with them regarded it as makrooh because they feared division and the generation of enmity, and that those who follow their whims and desires might take that as an excuse for coming late for prayers in congregation, so that they could pray in another jamaa’ah behind an imam who agreed with their deviant ways and innovations. So they blocked the way that leads to division and put an end to the aims of those who follow their evil whims and desires, by saying that no one should offer an obligatory prayer in congregation in a mosque when the prayer has already been offered in jamaa’ah with a regular imam or any other imam. 
The first opinion is the one which is correct, because of what we have said above about the general meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can”
[al-Taghaabun 64:16]
And the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “When I command you to do a thing, do as much of it as you can.” 
Undoubtedly praying in congregation is part of fearing Allah (taqwa) and is one of the things enjoined by sharee’ah, so we should strive to do it as much as we can. 
It is not right to contradict a sound narration with the opinions of some scholars who based their view repeating the jamaa’ah in the mosque as makrooh on their own rational thinking. Rather we should do that which is indicated by the saheeh reports. If it is known that a person or a group delays (joining the jamaa’ah) because of negligence, and does that repeatedly, or it is known from their behaviour or their affiliation with a different group that they are delaying in order to pray with others like them, they should be rebuked and they should be disciplined in whatever manner seems fit to those who are in charge, as a deterrent to them and others like them who follow their whims and desires. Thus the way to division will be barred and the aims of those who follow their whims and desires will be thwarted whilst also following the evidence which says that those who missed the first jamaa’ah should pray in another jamaa’ah. 
And Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and companions. 
Al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Ifta’ (Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas). 
This is with regard to the five daily prayers. With regard to Jumu’ah (Friday) prayer, it should not be repeated, rather it ends with the imam’s salaam. Whoever misses Jumu’ah prayer should pray Zuhr instead, whether on his own or with a jamaa’ah. 
The above is with regard to the ruling. With regard to sin, if the person’s delay was for a legitimate shar’i excuse, then there is no sin on him, but if there was no excuse then it is a sin.

    May Allaah reward you for your pride in your religion and 
    your desire to call others to Allaah. But you should note that a woman does 
    not have to call men directly without a mahram, because of the fitnah 
    (temptation) involved in that.  

    We advise you, and other women, to train yourself to obey 
    Allaah and to fulfil your duties towards Allaah and towards your husband, 
    family and children. Call women to Allaah as much as you can, by speaking up 
    or by reading books or by giving useful tapes or books, or by organizing a 
    study-circle if you have sufficient knowledge, or by speaking out if your 
    friends do something wrong, or by offering advice to your sisters and by 
    playing a part in helping them to solve their social problems, and so on. 

    With regard to your refraining from da’wah because of 
    shyness, this does not justify giving up da’wah, and it is a kind of 
    blameworthy shyness. But you should note that every action that a person 
    does may be difficult in the beginning and may make him feel shy sometimes, 
    but if he persists in it, it will become second-nature to him, and it may 
    reach the level that he cannot do without it. So you have to strive and be 
    patient, because calling people to Allaah, which includes enjoining that 
    which is good and forbidding that which is evil, needs patience, as Allaah 
    says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “By Al‑‘Asr (the time).

    Verily, man is in loss,

    Except those who believe (in Islamic Monotheism) and do 
    righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth [i.e. order one 
    another to perform all kinds of good deeds (Al‑Ma‘roof) which Allaah has 
    ordained, and abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds (Al‑Munkar) 
    which Allaah has forbidden], and recommend one another to patience (for the 
    sufferings, harms, and injuries which one may encounter in Allaah’s Cause 
    during preaching His religion of Islamic Monotheism or Jihad)”

    [al-‘Asr 103:1-3]
Patience in making 
    da’wah is a characteristic of the believers, and is one of the means of 
    salvation from loss, from which no one is saved but those whom Allaah 
    mentions in this soorah. They are the ones who combine four 
    characteristics: 

    1-Faith, which can only come 
    through knowledge of Allaah, His Messenger and the religion of Islam.

    2-Acting upon this knowledge.

    3-Calling others to this 
    knowledge.

    4-Patiently bearing any harm that 
    comes for the sake of gaining this knowledge, acting upon it and calling 
    others to it.

    Will regard to calling people via the internet, this is 
    something that is essential, but our advice to you and to every girl is to 
    avoid it, because of the dangers involved, from which few are saved apart 
    from those whom Allaah protects. There are some people who have undertaken 
    to carry out this great mission, which needs deep knowledge that will ward 
    off doubts, and sincere faith that will ward off the influence of whims and 
    desires. But for those who enter into this work without these two weapons or 
    with only one of them, they are rarely safe from its pitfalls. But if you 
    meet these two conditions then you can enter this field.

     Moreover you have done well by starting to wear hijaab, 
    which is obligatory upon Muslim women because Allaah says (interpretation of 
    the meaning):

     “O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women 
    of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. 
    screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). 
    That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) 
    so as not to be annoyed. And Allaah is Ever Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”
    [al-Ahzaab 33:59]

If spouses embrace each other whilst sleeping, this does not necessitate ghusl so long as hugging does not lead to emission of semen or intercourse. For more, please see the detailed answer.","Is sleeping naked with the spouse permitted?


Does hugging the wife necessitate ghusl?","Praise be to Allah.Is sleeping naked with the spouse permitted?
With regard to the first part of the question, it is permissible for the couple to sleep naked.  Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts.) Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their right hands possess, for then, they are free from blame.” [al-Muminun 23:5-6]
Imam Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Allah commands us to guard our chastity except from our wives or (the slaves) that our right hands possess; there is no blame in that case. This is general and includes seeing, touching and interacting.”  (al-Muhalla, 9/165) 
With regard to (evidence from) the Sunnah, it is narrated that ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and I used to do ghusl from one vessel placed between me and him. He would hasten until I would say, ‘Leave some for me, leave some for me.’”(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 258; Muslim, 321 – this version narrated by Muslim). 
Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said:  
Al-Dawudi took this as evidence to indicate that it is permissible for a man to look at the ‘awrah of his wife and vice versa. This is supported by the report narrated by Ibn Hibban from Sulayman ibn Musa, who was asked about a man looking at his wife’s private parts. He said, I asked ‘Ata and he said: I asked ‘Aishah and she mentioned this hadith. Al-Hafiz said: this is the definitive report on this matter. 
There is another hadith from the Sunnah, in which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Guard your ‘awrah, except from your wives or those (slaves) whom your right hands possess.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4017; al-Tirmidhi, 2769 – he classed it as hasan; Ibn Majah, 1920. Narrated mu’allaqan by al-Bukhari, 1/508). 
Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said, commenting on this hadith: what may be understood from the phrase ‘except from your wives’ is that it is permissible for a wife to look at his (‘awrah) and by analogy that he is also permitted to look (at her ‘awrah). 
Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“It is halal for a man to look at his womenfolk’s private parts – his wife and his female slave with whom he is permitted to have intercourse – and it is permissible for them to look at his private parts. There is no reservation at all concerning that. The proof of that is the well known reports narrated from ‘Aishah, Umm Salamah and Maymunah, the Mothers of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with them), who narrated that they used to do ghusl with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to cleanse themselves from janabah (impurity following sexual activity) from one vessel. The report of Maymunah clearly indicates that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was uncovered, because in her report it states that “he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) dipped his hand into the vessel then poured water over his private parts and washed them with his left hand.” After this there is no need to follow the (mere) opinion of anyone. It is strange that some of those ignorant people who want to make things difficult allow intercourse but forbid looking at the private parts!” (al-Muhalla, 9/165) 
Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Forbidding looking is a means of forbidding that which may lead to haram intercourse. If Allah has permitted a husband to have intercourse with his wife, how can it make sense that He would forbid him to look at her private parts?! No way.” (al-Silsilah al-Da’ifah, 1/353)
Does hugging the wife necessitate ghusl?
With regard to the ruling on taharah (purity) in this case, embracing one another whilst sleeping, so long as it does not lead to emission of maniy (semen) or intercourse, does not necessitate ghusl.
But if madhiy (prostatic fluid) is emitted, then the man has to wash his penis and testicles, and do wudu for prayer, and the woman has to wash her private part and do wudu likewise. 
And Allah knows best.

If you can please reply.,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is reported in al-Saheehayn from ‘Urwah ibn al-Zubayr that ‘Aa’ishah the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“The beginning of the Revelation that came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was good dreams; he never saw a dream but it came true like bright daylight. Then seclusion was made dear to him, and he used to go to the cave of Hiraa’ and worship there, which means that he went and devoted himself to worship for a number of nights before coming back to his family to collect more provisions, then he would go back again. Then he would go back to Khadeejah to collect more provisions. (This went on) until the truth came to him suddenly when he was in the cave of Hiraa’. The angel came and said, ‘Read!’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘I am not a reader.’ He said, Then he took hold of me and squeezed me until I could not bear it any more then he released me and said, ‘Read!’ I said, ‘I am not a reader.’ He took hold of me and squeezed me a second time until I could not bear it any more, then he released me and said, ‘Read!’ I said, ‘I am not a reader.’ He took hold of me and squeezed me a third time until I could not bear it any more, then he released me and said, 
‘Read! In the Name of your Lord Who has created (all that exists).
He has created man from a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood).
Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous.
Who has taught (the writing) by the pen.
He has taught man that which he knew not.’
[al-‘Alaq 96:1-5 – interpretation of the meaning]
Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went back with his heart beating wildly, until he came to Khadeejah and said, ‘Cover me! Cover me!’ They covered him till his fear went away. Then he said to Khadeejah, ‘O Khadeejah, I fear for myself,’ and he told her what had happened. Khadeejah said, ‘Nay, be of good cheer, for by Allah, Allah will never disgrace you. You uphold the ties of kinship, speak truthfully, help the poor and destitute, serve your guests generously and assist those who are stricken by calamity.’
Then Khadeejah took him to Waraqah ibn Nawfal, the son of her paternal uncle. He was a man who had become a Christian during the jaahiliyyah. He used to write Arabic script and he used to write from the Gospel in Arabic as much as Allah willed he should write. He was an old man who had become blind. Khadeejah said, ‘O son of my uncle, listen to what your nephew says.’ Waraqah said: ‘O son of my brother, what have you seen?’ [The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] told him what he had seen. Waraqah said: ‘This is the Naamoos [Jibreel] who came down to Moosa. Would that I were young and could live until the time when your people will drive you out.’ 
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘Will they really drive me out?’ Waraqah said, ‘Yes. Never has there come a man with that which you have brought, but he was persecuted. If I should live to see that day, I will support you strongly.’ But a few days later, Waraqah died, and the Revelation also ceased for a while, until the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was filled with grief.
Muhammad ibn Shihaab said: Abu Salamah ibn ‘Abd al-Rahmaan told me that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah al-Ansaari said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, speaking of that period when the revelation ceased: ‘Whilst I was walking, I heard a voice from the sky. I looked up and saw the angel who had come to me in Hiraa’, sitting on a chair between the heavens and the earth. I felt scared of him, so I came home and said, “Cover me, cover me [with blankets]!” So they did, then Allah revealed the words:
“O you (Muhammad) enveloped in garments!
Arise and warn!
And magnify your Lord (Allah)!
And purify your garments!
And keep away from Ar-Rujz (the idols)!”
[al-Muddathir 74:1-5].’”
Abu Salamah said: al-rujz were the idols which the people of the Jaahiliyyah used to worship. Then the revelation came frequently after that.

13490,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13490,Is Praying at Graves Permissible?,"I was in a conversation with a follower of the Sufi way of Islam and that person asked me what I thought about praying at the graves, or about religious scholars interceding during the day of Judgment. I told that person that praying to someone’s grave is shirk and no one can intercede except the Prophet. What is the ruling of the people of knowledge on this matter and where can I look for proof?",Praying to the occupant of the grave is major shirk. Praying the funeral prayer at the graveside is permissible. Praying the funeral prayer in the graveyard is permissible. Praying towards the graveyard is haram according to the correct opinion.,"Praying at graveyards 


Concept of intercession","Praise be to Allah.Praying at graveyards 
Praying at graves is of two types: 

The first type is praying to the occupant of the grave . This is major shirk which puts a person beyond the pale of Islam, because prayer is an act of worship, and it is not permissible to do any act of worship to anyone other than Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Worship Allah and join none with Him (in worship)” [al-Nisa 4:36] 
“Verily, Allah forgives not (the sin of) setting up partners (in worship) with Him, but He forgives whom He wills, sins other than that, and whoever sets up partners in worship with Allah, has indeed strayed far away” [al-Nisa 4:116]

The second type is praying to Allah in the graveyard. This covers a number of issues: 


Praying the funeral (janazah) prayer at the graveside which is permissible. 

Example: if a person dies and you are not able to offer the funeral prayer for him in the mosque, then it is permissible for you to offer the prayer for him after he is buried. 
The evidence for this is that this is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that a black man or a black woman used to clean the mosque, and he (or she) died. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked about them and they said, “They died.” He said, “Why did you not tell me? Show me to their grave.” So he went to the grave and offered the funeral prayer. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 458; Muslim, 956). 

Praying the funeral prayer in the graveyard which is permissible.

Example: a person dies and you are not able to offer the funeral prayer for him in the mosque, so you go to the graveyard and offer the prayer there before he is buried. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“It is permissible to offer the funeral prayer for the deceased inside the graveyard just as it is permissible to offer the funeral prayer for him after he is buried, because it was proven that a woman used to clean the mosque and she died. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked about her and they said, ‘She died.’ He said, ‘Why did you not tell me? Show me to her grave.’ So they showed him and he offered the prayer for her, then he said, ‘These graves are filled with darkness for their occupants, but Allah illuminates them by my prayer over them.’” (Narrated by Muslim, 956) (From Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 8/392) 

Praying in the graveyard – apart from the funeral (janazah) prayer – this prayer is invalid and does not count, whether it is an obligatory prayer or a nafl prayer. 

The evidence for that is as follows: 

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “All the earth is a mosque apart from the graveyards and bathrooms.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 317; Ibn Majah, 745; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, 606).
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “May Allah curse the Jews and the Christians, for they have taken the graves of their Prophets as places of worship.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 435; Muslim, 529).
Praying in graveyards may be a means that leads to worshipping the graves, or to imitating those who worship graves. Hence, because the kafirs used to prostrate to the sun as it was rising and setting, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade us to pray when the sun is rising or setting, lest that be taken as a means that leads to worshipping the sun instead of Allah, or to resembling the kuffar.


Praying towards the graveyard, which is haram, according to the correct opinion. 

Example: you pray with a graveyard or grave in the direction of your qiblah, but you are not praying in the graveyard, rather you are praying on some other ground that is close to the graveyard, with no wall or barrier between you and it. 
The evidence for this being haram: 

It was narrated that Abu Marthad al-Ghanawi said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not sit on graves, or pray towards them.” (Narrated by Muslim, 972). This indicates that it is haram to pray towards graveyards or towards graves or towards a single grave.
The reason why it is not allowed to pray towards a graveyard is the same as the reason why it is not allowed to pray towards a grave. So long as a person is facing towards the grave or graveyard in such a way that it may be said that he is praying towards it, then this comes under the prohibition, and if it comes under the prohibition then it is not valid, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Do not pray …” The prohibition here is on praying, so if a person prays towards a grave, he is combining obedience and disobedience, and it is not possible to draw closer to Allah in such a manner.

Note: If there is a wall between you and the graveyard, then the basic principle is that it is acceptable to pray in this case and it is not prohibited. Similarly, if there is a street or a considerable distance which would mean that you cannot be regarded as praying towards the graves, then this is acceptable. And Allah knows best.” (See al-Mughni, 1/403; al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 2/232)
Concept of intercession
You were mistaken when you said that no one will intercede on the Day of Resurrection except the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Rather the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will intercede and so will others among the believers. Please see Question no. 11931 . 
But we will add here an issue that was not mentioned there, which is that there are conditions attached to intercession : 

Permission must be granted by Allah to the intercessor to intercede.
Allah must approve of the one for whom intercession is to be made. 

The evidence for these two conditions is the verses in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And there are many angels in the heavens, whose intercession will avail nothing except after Allah has given leave for whom He wills and is pleased with.” [al-Najm 53:26] 
“and they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased.” [al-Anbiya 21:28]
As for the imaginary intercession which the idol-worshippers think their gods perform for them, this is an invalid intercession, for Allah does not permit intercession unless He is pleased both with the intercessor and those for whom intercession is made.  (See al-Qawl al-Mufid Sharh Kitab al-Tawhid by Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him), p. 336-337) 
The fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the believers will intercede does not justify asking them to intercede, as some people do when they ask the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to intercede for them even after his death.

Who is calling uon me, so I can answer him? who is seeking my forgiveness, so I can forgive him?'"". I got two questions about this hadith.
Does Allah descend to the lowest heavnes, or to the earth. There is another hadith saying that Allah comes in the shadow of the clouds and some animals know it except for jinn and mankind. I am confused, does Allah descend to the lowest heavens and animals sense it or he descends to earth?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: The matters that you have asked about are matters of the Unseen which man cannot know except via Revelation – i.e., the Qur’aan and Sunnah. Undoubtedly the divine descent ends at the lowest heaven, and Allah does not descend to the earth, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated: “Our Lord descends to the lowest heaven,” he did not say: to the earth. 
Secondly: With regard to what you mentioned about Allah coming in the shade of the clouds, and that some animals recognize that, after researching in the available books of hadeeth,  and studying the words of the scholars of deep knowledge who spoke of the issue of the descent of the Lord – may He be exalted – to the lowest heaven, we did not find anything to indicate that any such thing can be proven. What we have to do is to affirm that which was affirmed by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), which is that Allah descends to the lowest heaven, and that He descends in a manner that befits Him, and we refer knowledge of anything other than that to the One Who knows it, may He be exalted and glorified, for He is the All-Knowing, All-Wise. 
But it states in the Holy Qur’aan that when Allah comes on the Day of Resurrection to pass judgement, He will come in the shade of the clouds, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Do they then wait for anything other than that Allah should come to them in the shadows of the clouds and the angels? (Then) the case would be already judged. And to Allah return all matters (for decision)”
[al-Baqarah 2:210]
But this will happen on the Day of Resurrection. 
And it should be noted that there is no contradiction at all between our belief that Allah is above all things and that He is the Exalted, the Almighty, and our belief that He descends to the lowest heaven, for the highness of Allah is one of His essential attributes which cannot alter or change – i.e., it cannot be other than it is described at any time – so there is no contradiction between them, firstly, because the texts refer to both of them (i.e., His descending and His highness), and the texts cannot say anything that is impossible as is well known; and secondly, because there is nothing like unto Allah in all His attributes, so His descending is not like the descening of any of His creatures so that one could say that it contradicts the idea of His being exalted.

Will you be rewarded for having children?


Having children was the hope of the Prophets and Messengers","Praise be to Allah.Blessings of having children
Abu Dawud (2050) narrated that Ma’qil ibn Yasar said: A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, “I have found a woman who is of good lineage and is beautiful, but she does not bear children. Should I marry her?” He said, “No.” Then he came again with the same question and he told him not to marry her. Then he came a third time with the same question and he said: “Marry those who are loving and fertile, for I will be proud of your great numbers before the other nations.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Irwa al-Ghalil, 1784). 
This hadith indicates that it is encouraged to marry women who are fertile, so that the numbers of the ummah will increase, and so the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will feel proud of his ummah before all other nations. This shows that it is encouraged to have a lot of children. 
Will you be rewarded for having children?
Al-Ghazali said that when a man gets married, intending thereby to have children , that this is an act of worship for which he will be rewarded because of his good intention. He explained that in several ways: 

This is in accordance with what Allah wants, which is to perpetuate the human race. 
Seeking the love of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in having many children, so that he will feel proud of them before the other Prophets and nations on the Day of Resurrection. 
Seeking barakah (blessing) and a great deal of reward, and forgiveness of sins through the du`a of a righteous child after one dies. 

Having children was the hope of the Prophets and Messengers
It is well known that since ancient times children have been the hope of the Prophets and Messengers and all of the righteous slaves of Allah, and that will continue to be the case so long as man’s innate nature (fitrah) remains sound. Children are a blessing whom people love and on whom they pin their hopes. 
Ibrahim (peace be upon him) prayed to his Lord, saying (interpretation of the meaning): 
“My Lord! Grant me (offspring) from the righteous” [al-Saffat 37:100]
And Allah says of Zakariyya (peace be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): 
“When he called out to his Lord (Allah) a call in secret.
He said: ‘My Lord! Indeed my bones have grown feeble, and grey hair has spread on my head, and I have never been unblest in my invocation to You, O my Lord!
And verily, I fear my relatives after me, and my wife is barren. So give me from Yourself an heir.
Who shall inherit me, and inherit (also) the posterity of Ya’qub (Jacob) (inheritance of the religious knowledge and Prophethood, not of wealth). And make him, my Lord, one with whom You are Well-Pleased!’
(Allah said) ‘O Zakariyya (Zachariah)! Verily, We give you the glad tidings of a son, whose name will be Yahya (John). We have given that name to none before (him)’” [Maryam 19:3-7]
Allah praises His righteous slaves in many ways, such as when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who say: ‘Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders of the Muttaqun (the pious)’” [al-Furqan 25:74]
And Allah tells us that Shu’ayb (peace be upon him) commanded his people to remember Allah’s blessing to them when He made them many after they had been few. He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And remember when you were but few, and He multiplied you” [al-A’raf 7:86]
He regarded their being multiplied after they had been few as a great blessing which obliged them to obey Allah and obey His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Undoubtedly the benefits of increasing the nation’s offspring are obvious to everyone who thinks about the matter. Hence nations who understand this matter have been keen to encourage their people to increase their numbers and also to make their enemies reduce their numbers by means of specious arguments and sometimes by using means that lead to infertility and having few children, by means of drugs, contaminated food stuffs that reduce fertility and so on. This is one of the means of war used against the Muslim ummah by its enemies. 
We ask Allah to ward off the evil of those who disbelieve and to thwart their plots against the Muslims.

He() said ""No, as long as they establish the prayer."" How are we to understand what is meant by delaying the prayer beyond it's time?",,,"Praise be to Allah.May Allah reward you for your keenness to understand the matters of your religion, especially the prayer. We ask Allah to help you to fulfil this great trust, the trust of leading the people in their prayer. 
With regard to your question, it covers a number of topics: 
1 – What was narrated in Saheeh Muslim is: the Sahaabah sought permission to fight those leaders who changed and altered things to the extent that they introduced new things that the Sahaabah would denounce them for. Undoubtedly delaying the prayer from its time is one of these changes, but they were not given permission to fight them so long as the leader still established regular prayer. 
It was also narrated in Saheeh Muslim that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that there would be leaders who would delay the prayer from its time, so he told the Sahaabah to pray the prayer at the proper time, and to make their prayer with those leaders naafil. There follow some of the ahaadeeth: 
(i)The ahaadeeth which indicate that it is not allowed to fight the leaders who change and alter things, so long as they do not give up prayer altogether:
It was narrated from Umm Salamah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There will be rulers whose good deeds you will like and whose bad deeds you will dislike. One who sees through their bad deeds (and tries to prevent their repetition by his hand or through his speech), is absolved from blame, but one who hates their bad deeds (in the heart of his heart, being unable to prevent their recurrence by his hand or his tongue), is (also) safe (so far as Allah’s wrath is concerned). But one who approves of their bad deeds and imitates them is spiritually ruined.” They asked. “Shouldn't we fight against them?” He replied: “No, as long as they still pray.” (Saheeh Muslim, no. 1854) 
It was narrated from ‘Awf ibn Maalik that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of your leaders are those whom you love and who love you, who pray for you and you for them. The worst of your leaders are those whom you hate and they hate you, whom you curse and they curse you.” He was asked, “O Messenger of Allah, should we not fight them by the sword?” He said, “No, not so long as they establish the prayer among you. If you see anything on the part of your leaders that you dislike, denounce that action but do not break your allegiance to them.”  
(ii)The ahaadeeth which indicate that the leaders would delay the prayer from its time, but the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) still enjoined praying with them and he did not enjoin fighting them:
It was narrated that Abu Dharr said: “The Messenger of Allah said to me: ‘What would you do if you had leaders who delayed the prayer from its proper time or killed the prayer from its proper time?’ I said, ‘What do you command me to do?’ He said, ‘Pray the prayer at the proper time, then if you join them pray with them, and it will be a naafil prayer for you.’” 
2 – What is meant by ‘leaders’ (lit. imams) in this hadith is rulers, as is clearly stated in the hadiths of Umm Salamah and Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with them). 
3 – This is the focal point of the question: what is meant by delaying prayer from its proper time is delaying it from the preferred time. Imaam al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on Saheeh Muslim: 
“The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘What would you do if you had leaders who delayed the prayer from its proper time or killed the prayer from its proper time?’ I said, ‘What do you command me to do?’ He said, ‘Pray the prayer at the proper time, then if you join them pray with them, and it will be a naafil prayer for you.’ According to another report he said, ‘Pray the prayer at the proper time and make your prayer with him naafil.’ What is meant by ‘killing’ the prayer is delaying it, and making it like a dead person whose soul has departed. What is meant by delaying it from its proper time is delaying it from the preferred or best time, not delaying it from its time altogether, because what was narrated from the earlier and later rulers is that they delayed it from its preferred time; none of them delayed it from its time altogether. So we must interpret these reports according to what actually happened.”
(Sharh Saheeh Muslim, 5/47 ff) 
Thus it will be clear to you that there is a difference between establishing prayer and delaying it. The ahaadeeth are not referring to delaying the prayer from its time altogether until the time for the prayer is over and then praying, rather what is meant is delaying it from the preferred time, such as delaying ‘Asr until the sun has turned yellow, or delaying Maghrib until the red afterglow has almost disappeared, and so on. What is meant by not establishing prayer is not doing it at all. Thus we may reconcile between the ahaadeeth. And Allah is the Source of strength.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
13497,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13497,Islamic Holy Days and Special Occasions,"What holy days does Islam have?
What major historical events has Islam had?",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is a special day in Islam which Allah has singled out for blessings which are not to be found in any other days. This day is Friday, to which Allah guided the Muslims . It is the weekly festival of the Muslims, and it has many special features, some of which we will describe here:
1 – It was the teaching of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to venerate this day, honour it and single it out for special acts of worship that belong exclusively to this day. In Fajr (early morning prayer) on Friday he used to recite the Soorahs (chapters) ‘Alif-laam-meem tanzeel’ (al-Sajdah, no. 32) and ‘Hal ata ‘ala’l-insaan’ (al-Insaan, no. 76).
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite these two soorahs in the Fajr prayer on Friday because they refer to what happened and will happen on that day, for they speak of the creation of Adam, the resurrection and the gathering of mankind, all of which happened or will happen on a Friday. So reciting them on this day is a reminder to his ummah (nation) of what has happened and what is yet to come. This is one of the special features of Friday.
2 – It is mustahabb (recommended) to send lots of blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on the day of Friday and the night before, because he said: “Send lots of blessings upon me on Friday and the night before.” (Narrated by al-Bayhaqi, 3/249; classed as saheeh (sound) by al-Arna’oot).
3 – Jumu’ah (Friday) prayers are held on this day; this is one of the most strongly-affirmed duties of Islam, and one of the greatest gatherings of the Muslims. It is the greatest and most obligatory gathering in which they come together, apart from ‘Arafah [a place near Makkah where the pilgrims stand and pray during the Hajj or pilgrimage]. Whoever neglects Jumu’ah prayers out of carelessness, Allah will place a seal over his heart. The people of Paradise will be brought closer (to Allah) on the Day of Resurrection and they will see Allah sooner, commensurate with how close they were to the imam on the day of Jumu’ah and how early they came to Jumu’ah prayers.
4 – The command to do ghusl (take a bath for the purpose of purification) on Friday; this command is most emphatic.
5 – Wearing perfume on Friday; this is better than wearing perfume on any other day of the week.
6 – Cleaning the teeth with the siwaak (tooth stick); this is better than using the siwaak on any other day.
7 – Going to the prayers early.
8 – Keeping oneself busy with prayer, dhikr (remembering Allah) and reading Quran until the imaam comes out to give the khutbah (sermon).
9 – Listening attentively to the khutbah, because listening to it is obligatory according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions. If a person fails to do that he is engaging in idle talk, and whoever does that has not prayed Jumu’ah. In al-Musnad a marfoo’ report [i.e., a report which is attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)] states: “The one who says to his companion, ‘Be quiet and listen,’ has not prayed Jumu’ah.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 2034; classed as hasan by al-Arna’oot. See Haashiyat Zaad al-Ma’aad, 1/377. Also narrated by al-Bukhaari (934) and Muslim (851), with the wording: “If you say to your companion, ‘Be quiet and listen,’ on a Friday when the imaam is delivering the khutbah, then you have engaged in idle talk.”)
10 – Reading Soorat al-Kahf (no. 18) during the day of Friday. It was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever reads Soorat al-Kahf on a Friday, light will shine for him from beneath his feet to the clouds of the sky, which will shine on him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will be forgiven from one Friday to the next.” (Narrated by al-Haakim, 2/368; classed as saheeh by al-Arna’oot).
11 – It is a festival which is repeated every week. Ibn Maajah narrated in his Sunan that Abu Lubaabah ibn ‘Abd al-Mundhir said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Friday is the best and greatest of days before Allah, and it is greater before Allah than the day of al-Adha (the Feast of Sacrifice) and the day of al-Fitr (the Feast of Breaking the Fast). It has five characteristics: on this day Allah created Adam; on this day Adam came down to earth; on this day Allah caused Adam to die; on this day there is an hour during which no one asks Allah for something but He will grant it to him, so long as he does not ask for something haraam (forbidden); and on this day the Hour [i.e., the Day of Judgement] will begin, so there is no angel who is close to Allah, no heaven, no earth, no wind, no mountain and no tree that does not feel some apprehension on Friday.” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 1084. Al-Busayri said: its isnaad is hasan, and it was classed as saheeh in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 888).
12 – It is mustahabb (recommended) to wear the best clothes one has on Friday. Imaam Ahmad narrated in his Musnad that Abu Ayyoob said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, ‘Whoever takes a bath on Friday, puts on perfume if he has some, wears his best clothes then goes out , walking in a dignified manner until he reaches the mosque, then he prostrates in prayer if he wants and does not disturb anybody, then he remains quiet until the imaam comes out and he prays, that will be an expiation from one Friday to the next.’” (Narrated by Ahmad in al-Musnad, 23059; classed as hasan by al-Ana’oot).
In Sunan Abi Dawood it is narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Salaam that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say on the minbar (pulpit) one Friday: “There is nothing wrong with any one of you if he buys two garments for Friday other than his work day clothes.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1078; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 953).
13 – It is mustahabb on Fridays to perfume the mosque with incense. Sa’eed ibn Mansoor narrated from Na’eem ibn ‘Abd-Allah al-Mujmir that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) commanded him to perfume the mosque of Madeenah with incense every Friday until noontime. This is why Na’eem was called al-Mujmir (from the word tajmeer meaning perfuming with incense). 
14 – It is a day on which sins are expiated. In Saheeh al-Bukhaari it is narrated that Salmaan al-Faarisi said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘No man takes a bath on Friday and purifies himself as much as he can, and makes his hair tidy, and puts on perfume, then goes out, and does not come between two people, then prays as Allah decrees for him and listens attentively when the imaam speaks, but he will be forgiven for his bad deeds between this Friday and the other.’” (al-Bukhaari, 843).
15 – On Friday there is the “hour of response” which is an hour in which no Muslim asks Allah for something but He will grant it. In al-Saheehayn it is narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘On Friday there is an hour in which no Muslim asks for something whilst he is standing in prayer, but it will be given to him” – and he demonstrated the shortness of that time with his hands. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 883; Muslim, 1406).
16 – On Fridays there is the khutbah (sermon) which is intended to praise and glorify Allah, and to bear witness to His Oneness and to the Messengership of His Messenger, and to remind His slaves of His blessings, to warn them of His punishment and wrath, to advise them of that which will bring them closer to Him and His Paradise, and to forbid them that which will bring them closer to His anger and Hell. This is the purpose behind the khutbah and of gathering to hear it.
17 – It is the day on which it is mustahabb to devote oneself to worship and it has an advantage over other days by being characterized with all kinds of worship, obligatory and mustahabb. Allah has made for the followers of each religion a day on which they devote themselves to worship and refrain from worldly work. So Friday is a day of worship, and in relation to other days it is like Ramadaan in relation to other months; the “hour of response” on Friday is like Laylat al-Qadr (the Night of Decree) in Ramadaan. Hence whoever gets it right on Friday, his whole week will be good, and whoever gets it right in Ramadan, his whole year will be good, and whoever gets it right on Hajj, his whole life will be good. Friday is the measure of the week, Ramadaan is the measure of the year and Hajj is the measure of one's life. And Allah is the Source of strength.
19 – It is the day with which Allah has exclusively favoured this ummah, and from which He led the People of the Book astray before them, as it says in al-Saheeh, where it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The sun has never risen or set on any day better than Friday. Allah guided us to it and led the people away from it. The people are behind us in this respect. It (Friday) is for us, Saturday is for the Jews and Sunday is for the Christians.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 10305, classed as saheeh by Ibn Khuzaymah, 3/114).
20 – It is the day which Allah chose from among all the days of the week, just as He chose Ramadaan from among the months of the year and Laylat al-Qadr from among all the nights, and Makkah from among all places on earth, and Muhammad from all of mankind.
With regard to the second question, the Muslims have several special occasions, such as:
1 – The blessed month of Ramadaan, which is a month that has special characteristics. You will find more information in Question no. 13480.
2 – Eid al-Fitr (the Feast of Breaking the Fast). This is the first day of the month of Shawwaal, on which the Muslims express their joy at the blessing which Allah has bestowed upon them by enabling them to complete the month-long fast of Ramadaan.
3 – The Day of ‘Arafah, which is the ninth day of the month of Dhu’l-Hijjah, the day of the greater Pilgrimage (Hajj), the greatest pillar of the Hajj. It has many virtues, details of which are to be found in question https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7284/virtues-of-the-day-of-arafaah.
 4 – Eid al-Adha (the Feast of Sacrifice). The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of days is the Day of Sacrifice.” This is the tenth day of Dhu’l-Hijjah. It was narrated that ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The Day of ‘Arafah, the Day of Sacrifice and the Days of al-Tashreeq [the three days following the Day of Sacrifice] are a festival for us Muslims, and they are days of eating and drinking.’” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 704; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 620).","See Zaad al-Ma’aad, 1/375"
13498,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13498,"If the imam or a person praying in congregation forgets to recite al-Faatihah, what should he do?",What is the ruling if an imam or a person praying in congregation forgets to recite al-Faatihah during the prayer?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: we have already stated in the answer to question no
    
    10995 that 
    reciting al-Faatihah is an essential part of the prayer without which the 
    prayer is not valid. It is essential to recite it, whether one is praying 
    alone, as an imam or behind an imam, and whether the prayer is one in which 
    Qur’aan is recited out loud or quietly. 

    Secondly: If the imam forgets it in the first rak’ah, and he 
    does not remember until he stands up for the second rak'ah, then the second 
    rak’ah becomes the first rak'ah for him. Based on this, he has to offer 
    another rak’ah to make up for the first rak’ah in which he did not recite 
    al-Faatihah. With regard to the people praying behind him, they should not 
    follow him in this rak’ah, rather they should sit for the tashahhud, then 
    wait and say the salaam with the imam. 

    With regard to a person praying behind an imam who forgot to 
    recite al-Faatihah, for those who say that the person who prays behind an 
    imam does not have to recite al-Faatihah the matter is straightforward: he 
    does not have to do anything. For those who say that it is an essential part 
    of the prayer for him, and he is like the imam, then if he did not recite 
    it, he has to offer another rak’ah after the imam says the salaam, unless he 
    joined the prayer when the imam was bowing, or when the imam was standing 
    but he bowed before he could finish reciting it. In that case he does not 
    have to recite it in the first rak’ah.
