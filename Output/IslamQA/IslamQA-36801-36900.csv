36801,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36801,"It is makrooh to interlace one's fingers when going out to pray, until one has prayed",What is the ruling on interlacing one's fingers when in the mosque?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    This is part of the etiquette of going out to the mosque, 
    concerning which it says in the Sunnah that one should not interlace the 
    fingers. 

    It was narrated from Thumaamah al-Hannaat that Ka’b ibn 
    ‘Ujrah saw him when he was heading towards the mosque. They met one another 
    and he said: he found me interlacing my fingers and told me not to do that, 
    and he said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “When one of you does wudoo’ and does it well, then goes out 
    heading to the mosque, let him not interlace his fingers, for he is in a 
    state of prayer.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 562; classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
This hadeeth indicates 
    that it is not allowed to interlace the fingers when one is walking to the 
    mosque to pray, because the one who is headed towards the mosque comes under 
    the same ruling as one who is praying. 

    Al-Khattaabi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Interlacing 
    the fingers is something that some people do absent-mindedly, or some do it 
    to crack their fingers. A man may sit and interlace his fingers and wrap his 
    hands around his knees (whilst seated) in order to relax or try to sleep, so 
    it may cause him to lose his wudoo’. So it is said to the one who has 
    purified himself and set out towards the mosque: do not interlace your 
    fingers because all of the different things that we have mentioned do not 
    befit the prayer or the state of the one who is praying. End quote from 
    Ma’aalim al-Sunan, 1/295.

     In the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah about the story of 
    Dhu’l-Yadayn and the topic of the prostration of forgetfulness, it says: “He 
    went and stood by a piece of wood that was set up in the mosque, and leaned 
    against it as if he was angry, and he placed his right hand on his left and 
    interlaced his fingers…” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 482; Muslim, 573. 

    There is no contradiction between this and what we have 
    mentioned above, because this instance of interlacing the fingers came after 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) thought the 
    prayer was over, so it comes under the ruling of one who has finished 
    praying. The prohibition applies only to the one who is praying and the one 
    who is heading towards the mosque, because it is a kind of fidgeting and not 
    focusing with proper humility. 

    Imam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
    “Chapter on interlacing the fingers in the mosque and elsewhere” and he 
    narrated ahaadeeth from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) which show that he interlaced his fingers in the mosque and 
    elsewhere, including the hadeeth about Dhu’l-Yadayn mentioned above. 

    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said, reconciling between these ahaadeeth 
    and the ahaadeeth which speak of the prohibition: 
Al-Ismaa’eeli reconciled 
    between them by noting that the prohibition is limited to when one is in 
    prayer or is intending to pray, because the one who is waiting for the 
    prayer comes under the same ruling as one who is praying… Then al-Haafiz 
    said: The report which says that this is forbidden so long as one is in the 
    mosque is da’eef (weak) as we have stated above. End quote. 

    Fath al-Baari, 1/565 

    It is worth noting that there are some worshippers who fidget 
    with their fingers by cracking them, but this fidgeting does not befit one 
    who is praying as it is indicative of a lack of proper focus and humility, 
    because if the heart is focused, the limbs will also be focused and be 
    still. 

    It was narrated that Shu’bah, the freed slave of Ibn ‘Abbaas, 
    said: I prayed beside Ibn ‘Abbaas and cracked my fingers. When the prayer 
    was over he said: “May you be bereft of your mother! You crack your fingers 
    when you are in prayer?” Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah, 2/344. al-Albaani said 
    in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel (2/99): its isnaad is hasan. 

    Conclusion: Interlacing the fingers is makrooh for one who is 
    going out to pray, until he has finished the prayer. If a person is sitting 
    in the mosque, there is nothing wrong with him interlacing his fingers 
    unless he is waiting for the prayer, in which case it is makrooh for him to 
    interlace them. 

    And Allaah knows best.

I have two sisters aged 14 and 16. They do not wear jilbaabs, rather they just cover their heads. When I try to convince them to wear jilbaab my mother stands in my way even though she wears jilbaab herself, and she tells me that when they grow up we will make them wear jilbaab. I adhere to the command in the Qur’aan to respect our parents, so I keep quiet. 

I want to ask:

 1 – Should I keep quiet and wait till my sisters grow up?

2 – Should I go against my parents and make my sisters wear the jilbaab, especially since my parents are strongly opposed to this idea at present ?

    to make them adhere to the command of Allaah. But you should do that in a

“O 
    Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers 
    to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves 
    completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, 
    that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be 
    annoyed. And Allaah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”
    [al-Ahzaab 33:59]
Al-Qurtubi 
    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:  
It was the 
    custom of the Arab women to be uncovered. They used to uncover their faces 
    as slave woman do, which prompted men to look at them and provoked desires 
    in them. So Allaah commanded His Messenger  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) to tell them put on their jilbaabs when they went out, 
    if they wanted to go out to relieve themselves, because they used to go out 
    into the desert before they began to use chamber pots. This was in order to 
    distinguish between them and slave woman, so that free woman would be 
    recognized by their covering, and no one would harass them. Before this 
    verse was revealed, believing women would go out for their needs and the 
    evildoers would think that they were slave women, so they would harass them, 
    and the free women would should at them. They complained about that to the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and this verse was 
    revealed for that reason. This was said by al-Hasan and others.

It is well known that the man is a “stranger” (non-mahram) to his fiancée until the marriage contract is done. 
It makes no difference whether this correspondence is done via e-mail or regular mail, or over the telephone, but it is better if the correspondence and conversation is with her guardian only. 
Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allah preserve him) was asked about a man speaking to his fiancée over the phone – is that permissible according to sharee’ah or not? 
He replied: 
There is nothing wrong with a man speaking to his fiancée over the phone, if that is after they have agreed to marry, and the conversation is in order to discuss different issues and is done only as much as is needed, and there is no fitnah involved. If that is done through her wali (guardian) that is preferable and less dubious.

“The Hajj (pilgrimage) is (in) the well-known (lunar year) months (i.e. the 10th month, the 11th month and the first ten days of the 12th month of the Islamic calendar, i.e. two months and ten days). So whosoever intends to perform Hajj therein (by assuming Ihraam), then he should not have sexual relations (with his wife), nor commit sin, nor dispute unjustly during the Hajj.”

[al-Baqarah 2:197]?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.In this verse Allaah mentions some of the rulings and etiquette that have to do with Hajj. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The Hajj (pilgrimage) is (in) the 
    well-known (lunar year) months” 
i.e., the time  for Hajj is the well-known 
    months which are Shawwaal, Dhu’l-Qa’dah and the first ten days of Dhu’l-Hijjah. Some of the scholars were of the view that the whole of 
    Dhu’l-Hijjah is one of the months of Hajj. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So whosoever intends to perform Hajj 
    therein” 
i.e., whoever enters ihraam for that, because 
    when a person enters ihraam for Hajj, he has to complete it, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And perform properly (i.e. all the 
    ceremonies according to the ways of Prophet Muhammad), the Hajj and ‘Umrah (i.e. the pilgrimage to Makkah) for Allaah”
[al-Baqarah 2:196]
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“then he should not have sexual relations 
    (with his wife), nor commit sin, nor dispute unjustly during the Hajj” 
i.e., when he has entered ihraam for Hajj, he must respect it and protect it from everything 
    that may spoil it or detract from it, of sexual relations, sin and argument. 
Rafath 
    (translated here as sexual relations) means intercourse and everything that leads up to it of both words and deeds, such as kissing, speaking 
    about intercourse and desire, etc. 
The word rafath is also used to refer 
    to obscene speech. 
Fusooq (sin) 
    means all kinds of disobedience and sin, such as disobeying one’s parents, severing ties of kinship, consuming riba, consuming orphans’ property, 
    backbiting and gossiping, etc. It also includes the things that are forbidden during ihraam. 
Jidaal (dispute) 
    means arguing and debating with no just basis. It is not permissible for the person who has entered ihraam for Hajj or ‘Umrah to argue with no 
    basis. 
With regard to debating in a good manner in 
    order to explain the truth, this is something that is enjoined by Allaah, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Invite (mankind, O Muhammad) to the way of your Lord (i.e. Islam) with wisdom (i.e. with the 
    Divine Revelation and the Qur’aan) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better”
[al-Nahl 16:125]
Although these things – obscene speech, sin 
    and false arguments – are not allowed at any time or in any place, the prohibition is even more emphatic during Hajj, because the purpose of Hajj 
    is to be humble before Allaah and to draw closer to Him by means of the acts of worship as much as possible, and to keep away from evil deeds. 
    Thus one's Hajj will be accepted, and an accepted Hajj brings no less a reward than Paradise. 
We ask Allaah to help us to remember Him, 
    give thanks to Him and to worship Him properly.

36818,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36818,Her husband left her for a long time with her agreement; is she sinning by not asking for a divorce?,"The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Any woman who asks her husband for a divorce with no reason, the fragrance of Paradise will be forbidden to her.”

 My question: What is the ruling on a wife whose husband left her 4 years ago and she is neither divorced nor is she a wife in any real sense, but she does not want a divorce because she loves him very much, and she hopes that Allaah will guide him and she can go back to him – is she sinning with regard to herself or her husband?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly:  

    Islam has given men a great deal of responsibility, which is 
    to take care of the family and to be the protector and maintainer. The man’s 
    role in fulfilling his duties towards his family is very great, and this 
    role requires him to be present all the time so that he can keep an eye on 
    everything, correct mistakes and guide his young children. He is the 
    mainstay, protector and foundation of this family.  

    If a man neglects his role, that results in unjust treatment 
    for his wife. Allaah says in a hadeeth qudsi: “O My slaves, I have forbidden 
    injustice to Myself and I have made it haraam amongst you, so do not treat 
    one another unjustly.” This may lead to destruction of the family and a 
    great deal of evil may result from this separation, for both the man and the 
    woman. Each of them may take a lover to make up for missing their spouse, 
    for the Shaytaan exploits weak points and flows through the son of Adam like 
    blood. 

    In addition to that, think of the injustice that happens to 
    the children as a result and the shortcoming in taking care of them that 
    means that the woman has to work harder and play the role of both father and 
    mother at the same time. This is something that cannot be done in most 
    cases. We all know the status of the father and the role that he plays in 
    the family, and what may happen when he is not there. How will the children 
    be raised, and how much will they suffer when their father is absent from 
    them? This is what makes children hate their fathers, because they abandoned 
    them and did not take care of them or look after them as they should.  

    Secondly: 

    A man may dislike his wife and not be able to stand being 
    with her any longer. In that case it is prescribed in sharee’ah for him 
    either to keep her in a proper and decent manner or to let her go in a kind 
    manner. He may not be able to keep her in a decent manner because of his 
    intense dislike for her – for example – or for some other reason, so there 
    remains no choice but to be frank, in a kind manner, and divorce her kindly, 
    and give her all her rights in full. 

    The woman may want to stay with him as a wife, so she may ask 
    him to keep her and forego some of her rights over him, such as the division 
    of his time (in the case of a plural marriage) and spending. In that case 
    the man should agree to her request, because that will make her feel good 
    and will mean that he is still being kind to her, especially if that will 
    not cause him any harm or problems. 

    The following verse was revealed concerning such situations 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if a woman fears 
    cruelty or desertion on her husband’s part, there is no sin on them both if 
    they make terms of peace between themselves; and making peace is better. And 
    human inner-selves are swayed by greed. But if you do good and keep away 
    from evil, verily, Allaah is Ever Well‑Acquainted with what you do”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:128]

    ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said – as narrated 
    by al-Bukhaari (4910) and Muslim (3021) – that this verse was revealed 
    concerning such situations. She said: “ ‘And if a woman fears cruelty or 
    desertion on her husband’s part’ this refers to a woman who is married 
    to a man who does not want to keep her any longer and wants to divorce her 
    and marry someone else, and she says to him: ‘Keep me and do not divorce me, 
    but marry someone else too, and you do not have to spend on me or give me a 
    share of your time.’ This is what Allaah says: ‘there is no sin on them 
    both if they make terms of peace between themselves; and making peace is 
    better’.” 

    Conclusion: 

    It is not permissible for a man to leave his wife for so 
    long; if he does that, then the woman has the right to refer the matter to 
    the qaadi and ask for a divorce so as to avoid harmful consequences. 

    If she chooses to be patient in the hope that Allaah will 
    guide him and he will give up this mistreatment, there is no sin on her in 
    sha Allaah, subject to the condition that this does not expose her to 
    temptation because of her being away from her husband.

Mistakes made in Farewell Tawaf","Praise be to Allah.Tawaf: The last action of Hajj
Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The people were commanded that the last thing they should do in Makkah was to circumambulate the Ka’bah, but an exception was made for menstruating women.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1755; Muslim, 1328) 
Mistakes made in Farewell Tawaf
So tawaf should be the last action of Hajj that a person does. 
People make several mistakes when performing the farewell tawaf : 

Some people do not make tawaf the last thing that they do, rather they go down to Makkah and do the farewell tawaf when they still have to stone the jamarat, then they go out to Mina and stone the jamarat and then leave. This is a mistake and that does not suffice as the farewell tawaf in this case, because it is not the last thing that the person does in Makkah, rather the last thing that he does is stoning the jamarat. 
Some people do the farewell tawaf and then stay in Makkah after that. This means that their farewell tawaf is invalidated, and they must do another one when they are going to leave. But if a person stays in Makkah after doing the farewell tawaf in order to buy something or to load his luggage etc, there is nothing wrong with that. 
Some people, when they do the farewell tawaf and want to leave the Mosque, walk backwards, saying that they do not want to turn their backs to the Ka’bah. This is a bid’ah (innovation) which was not done by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or by any of his Companions. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) venerated Allah and His House and if this were indeed an act of veneration towards Allah and His House, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have done it. The Sunnah is, when a person has completed the farewell tawaf, to leave the Mosque walking forwards, even if he turns his back towards the Ka’bah in this situation. 
Some people, after doing the farewell tawaf, stop at the door when leaving the mosque and turn to face the Ka’bah, as if bidding farewell to it, and they make du’a or say salams and so on. This is also a kind of bid’ah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do that. If it were something good the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have done it.

What is meant by exhorting the dying person to say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah is that there should be someone with him who can remind him to say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah, as if teaching and prompting a small child.  
It is mustahabb to exhort the dying person to utter the Kalimah or word of faith in this situation, so that his life will end with that and it will be the last words that he utters. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined it. It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Exhort your dying ones to say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah.” Narrated by Muslim, 916. 
It was narrated that Mu’aadh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “If a person’s last words are Laa ilaaha ill-Allah, Paradise will be guaranteed for him.” Narrated by Ahmad, 21529; Abu Dawood, 3116; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 687 
It was narrated from Anas that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) visited a man from among the Ansaar when he was sick and he said: “O maternal uncle, say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah.” He said: “Maternal uncle or paternal uncle?” He said: “Maternal uncle.” He said: “Is it better for me to say it?’ He said: “Yes.” Narrated by Ahmad, 13414. Al-Albaani said in Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz: its isnaad is saheeh according to the conditions of Muslim. 
The dying person should not be bothered with repeated requests to say it, if he has said it and does not say anything after that. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
They (the scholars) regarded it as makrooh to exhort him repeatedly or continuously, lest that cause him hardship and distress and he dislikes that in his heart and says something that is not appropriate. They said: If he says it once, he need not be reminded again unless he says something else after that, in which case he should be reminded again so that it will be the last thing that he says. End quote. 
When ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Mubaarak (may Allah have mercy on him) was dying, a man started prompting him to say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah, and he did that a great deal. He said to him:  “You are not doing something good. I fear that you will annoy a Muslim after me. When you prompted me, if I say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah, then I did not say anything else after that, leave me alone, but if I say anything, then exhort me to say it again, so that it will be the last thing I say.”

This exhortation is prescribed even if the dying person is a kaafir, because if he says it before the soul is taken, saying it will benefit him, even if he is punished for his sins. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Exhort your dying ones to say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah, for if a person’s last words are Laa ilaaha ill-Allah at the time of death, he will enter Paradise at some point, no matter what befalls him before that.” Narrated by Ibn Hibbaan; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 5150. 
Another indication that the command to exhort the dying to say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah includes kaafirs too is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did with his paternal uncle Abu Taalib, and with the Jewish boy who used to serve him. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was present when his uncle Abu Taalib was dying, and he said to him: “O uncle, say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah, a word for which I will testify for you before Allah.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3884; Muslim, 24. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was also present when the Jewish boy who used to serve him was dying. He said to him: “Become Muslim” – according to the report narrated by Ahmad (12381): “Say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1356. 
Two notes from Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him): 
Should this exhortation come in the form of a command, whereby one says to the dying person: “Say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah” or should it be done by repeating the words in his presence so that he will remember them when he hears someone saying them by his side? 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
That depends on the condition of the sick person. If he is of strong faith and can accept the command, or if he is a kaafir, he should be commanded to say it, by saying: “Say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah,” “Let your life end with Laa ilaaha ill-Allah” and so on. 
If he is a Muslim and is of weak faith, he should not be commanded, rather Allah should be mentioned in his presence so that he will hear and remember. This differentiation is based on the reports and on rational thinking.  
In the reports, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded his uncle Abu Taalib, when he was dying, to say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah. He said: “O uncle, say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah.” 
As for rational thinking: If he says it, all well and good, and if he does not say it, he is a kaafir anyway. If we assume that if he did not like this command and did not say it, then he remains as he is and nothing has changed. If he is a Muslim and can bear it if we tell him to say it, it will not affect him, but if he is weak (in faith) and we tell him to say it, perhaps he will react by becoming upset and angry, and he will reject it as he is departing this world. There are some people who, if they are told to say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah when they are in a state of good health, they will say: “I will never say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah.” At times of anger, some people get so confused that they say, “I do not to say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah.” So what do you think about this situation? 
Secondly: 
We are to exhort the dying person to say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah and not “Muhammad rasool-Allah” because this is what is narrated in the hadeeth: “Exhort your dying ones to say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If a person’s last words in this world are Laa ilaaha ill-Allah, he will enter Paradise.” The word of Tawheed is the key to Islam, and whatever comes after that is additional. 
If a person combines both phrases of the Shahaadah and says Laa ilaaha ill-Allah Muhammad rasool Allah, this does not mean that his last words in this world are not Laa ilaaha ill-Allah, because the testimony that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the Messenger of Allah is a part of that affirmation.  
Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) regarded these words, along with the testimony that Allah is God, as a single principle, and there is no need to exhort the person repeatedly. The apparent meaning of the evidence is that it is not sufficient for the dying person to say Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasool-Allah, rather he must say: Laa ilaaha ill-Allah. End quote from al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 5/177 
The evidence that the Muslim should be commanded to say it if he is strong in faith is derived from the hadeeth about the Ansaari that is quoted above, in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded him to say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah: “O maternal uncle, say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah.”   
Similarly, the doctor said to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, after he gave him milk to drink and the milk came out of his wound solid and white: “O Ameer al-Mu’mineen, recommend someone to succeed you.” ‘Umar said: “You are being truthful with me. Had you said something else, I would not have believed you.” The people wept when they heard that and he said: “Do not weep for us. Whoever wants to weep, let him go out. Did you not hear what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said – ‘The deceased is tormented because of his family’s weeping over him’?” Narrated by Ahmad, 296; Ahmad Shaakir said: its isnaad is saheeh.",Islam Q&A

There is also nothing wrong with her reciting Quran, according to the correct opinion, because there is no report that clearly states that a menstruating woman or a woman who is bleeding following childbirth is not allowed to recite Quran. Rather it is narrated specifically that one who is junub (in a state of impurity following sexual activity) should not recite Quran when he is junub. With regard to menstruating women or women who are bleeding following childbirth, there is a hadeeth narrated from Ibn ‘Umar which says “The menstruating woman and the one who is junub should not recite anything,” but this is da’eef (weak). But she should recite without touching the Mus-haf, from memory. Based on that, it is more apt that she is allowed to read books in which there are du’aa’s mixed with ahaadeeth and verses from the Quran etc. This is the correct view and it is the more correct of the two scholarly opinions.

36830,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36830,"Ruling on those who drowned in the Egyptian ferry, and offering the funeral prayer for them",In the last few days the Egyptian ferry sank and the number of those who drowned in this accident is nearly one thousand. Are they considered to be martyrs? How can we offer the funeral prayer for those of them who have not been found?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Undoubtedly all things are in the hand of Allaah, may He be 
    glorified and exalted, and He controls them as He wills. We may note the 
    following about this incident: 

    Firstly: 

    Allaah may choose from among His believing slaves some types 
    of people, individually or in groups, and send calamity upon them so that 
    the calamity may raise them in status and expiate their sins. So calamities 
    are a means of expiating sins and raising one in status. The Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is nothing that 
    befalls a believer, not even a thorn that pricks him, but Allaah will record 
    one good deed for him thereby or erase one bad deed.” Narrated by Muslim 
    (2572). 

    Secondly: 

    What is prescribed for a Muslim if calamity befalls him is to 
    be patient, and to say that which the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) enjoined upon us. It was narrated that Umm Salamah (may 
    Allaah be pleased with her) said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “There is no Muslim who is 
    stricken with a calamity and says what Allaah has enjoined – ‘Verily to 
    Allaah we belong and unto Him is our return. O Allaah, reward me for my 
    affliction and compensate me with something better’ – but Allaah will 
    compensate him with something better.” Narrated by Muslim (918). 

    Thirdly: 

    Whoever dies by drowning is a martyr (shaheed) and 
    will have the reward of the martyrs with Allaah, may He be exalted. It was 
    narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “The martyrs are five: the one who dies of the plague, the one who dies of a 
    stomach disease, the one who drowns, the one who is killed by a falling wall 
    and the martyr (who dies) for the sake of Allaah.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari 
    (2829) and Muslim (1914). According to a version narrated by Muslim (1915): 
    “the one who drowns is a martyr.” 

    Ibn al-Teen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: All of these 
    deaths involve hardship and Allaah has shown favour to the ummah of Muhammad 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) by making them a means of 
    erasing their sins and increasing their reward, and causing them to attain 
    the status of the martyrs. 

    Fath al-Baari (8/438). See also 
    the answer to question no. 22140. 

    Fourthly: 

    Whomever Allaah has saved from this accident and brought 
    forth safely, let him praise Allaah for that, and do good for the rest of 
    his life, for death will certainly come to man, but Allaah delayed it and 
    saved him. If He had willed, it could have turned out otherwise. 

    Fifthly: 

    If a person is brought out dead, then he must be washed and 
    shrouded, and the funeral prayer offered for him. With regard to the one who 
    cannot be found, the funeral prayer must be offered for them in absentia, 
    because offering the funeral prayer is a communal obligation (fard 
    kafaayah) which must be fulfilled. So the people should form rows and 
    the imam should go forward and lead the prayer for him as if the bier were 
    in front of them. 

    It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah: 

    If the drowned person can be found, then he should be washed 
    and shrouded and the funeral prayer offered for him as with any other 
    deceased person, but if he cannot be found, then the funeral prayer should 
    be offered for him in absentia, according to the Shaafa’is and Hanbalis. End 
    quote. 

    Al-Bukhaari (1318) and Muslim (951) narrated that Abu 
    Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) announced the death of the Negus to his 
    companions on the day he died, and he led them out to the prayer-place, then 
    he went forward and they formed rows behind him, and he said takbeer four 
    times. 

    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This is 
    evidence for al-Shaafa’i and those who agreed with him with regard to 
    offering the funeral prayer in absentia. End quote. 

    We have discussed the issue of offering the funeral prayer in 
    absentia in the answer to question no. (35853). 

    We ask Allaah to accept them as martyrs and to grant their 
    families patience and consolation.

Can Muslims celebrate Laylat al-Qadr?","Praise be to Allah.Striving hard in worship during the last ten days of Ramadan 
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to strive hard in worship during the last ten days of Ramadan as he never did at any other time, praying, reading Quran and making du’a. Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated from ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that when the last ten days of Ramadan came, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would stay up at night and would wake his family up, and would abstain from marital relations. Ahmad and Muslim narrated that he used to strive hard in worship during the last ten days of Ramadan as he never did at any other time. 
How to observe Laylat al-Qadr
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined staying up and praying on Laylat al-Qadr out of faith and in the hope of reward. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:  “Whoever stays up and prays on Laylat al-Qadr out of faith and in the hope of reward, his previous sins will be forgiven.” Agreed upon. This hadith indicates that it is prescribed to observe Laylat al-Qadr by spending the night in prayer. 
Du’a for Laylat al-Qadr
One of the best du’as that may be recited on Laylat al-Qadr is that which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught to ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her). Al-Tirmidhi narrated, and classed the report as sahih, that ‘Aishah said: “I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, if I know which night is Laylat al-Qadr, what should I say on that night?’ He said, ‘Say: Allahumma innaka ‘afuwwun tuhibb al-‘afwa fa'fu ‘anni (O Allah, You are forgiving and You love forgiveness, so forgive me).” 
When is Laylat al-Qadr?
With regard to specifying which night of Ramadan is Laylat al-Qadr , this needs specific evidence, but the odd-numbered nights during the last ten nights are more likely than others, and the night of the twenty-seventh is the most likely to be Laylat al-Qadr, because that is mentioned in the ahadith. 
Can Muslims celebrate Laylat al-Qadr?
With regard to innovations, they are not permissible during Ramadan or at other times. It was proven that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever innovates anything in this matter of ours that is not part of it will have it rejected.” According to another report, “Whoever does any action that is not part of this matter of ours will have it rejected.” 
We know of no basis for the celebrations that are held during some nights of Ramadan. The best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the worst of matters are those which are innovated (bid’ah).

36833,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36833,Should he go back to a state of ihraam if he did not do tawaaf al-ifaadah on the day of Eid?,"I heard that if a person does not do tawaaf al-ifaadah on the day of Eid, he should go back to a state of ihraam until he does tawaaf. Is this correct?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    A hadeeth concerning this was narrated from Umm Salamah (may 
    Allaah be pleased with her). Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on 
    him) was asked about this matter and he replied: 

    You asked about the hadeeth of Umm Salamah (may Allaah be 
    pleased with her) which says that if a person did not do tawaaf al-ifaadah 
    before the sun sets on the day of ‘Eid, he must go back to a state of 
    ihraam.  

    It should be noted that this is a weak hadeeth which cannot 
    be quoted as evidence as it is not proven from the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), for a number of reasons: 

    1 – With regard to its isnaad, Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawood and Ibn 
    Khuzaymah all narrated it from Muhammad ibn Ishaaq, the well known author of 
    Seerah. He said: Abu ‘Ubaydah ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Zam’ah narrated to us, 
    from his father and from his mother, from Umm Salamah (may Allaah be pleased 
    with her). According to this report the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “If evening comes before you have circumambulated 
    this House, then you should go back to a state of ihraam as you were before 
    you stoned the Jamrah, until you circumambulate it.” 

    With regard to Ibn Ishaaq, in his mufrad reports (those which 
    were narrated by him only) there is some oddness. Imam Ahmad was asked 
    whether a hadeeth which was narrated only by Ibn Ishaaq could be accepted 
    and he said: No, by Allaah. 

    Muhammad ibn Yahya said: His hadeeth is hasan but he narrates 
    some ghareeb (odd) reports. Al-Daaraqutni said: The imams differed 
    concerning him; his reports cannot be taken as proof but they may be taken 
    into consideration. End quote. Tahdheeb 9/39-46 

    Perhaps this hadeeth is one of his mufrad and odd hadeeths. 

    With regard to Abu ‘Ubaydah ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Zam’ah, it 
    says of him in al-Taqreeb (2/448): He is accepted at the third-rate 
    level. 

    It says of him in al-Muhalla (7/142): He is not known 
    for narrating hadeeth, or for memorizing. If the hadeeth of Umm Salamah were 
    saheeh we would be quick to say so. End quote. 

    Al-Tahhaawi narrated in Sharh Ma’aani al-Athaar 
    (2/228) a hadeeth similar to that of Umm Salamah, but it is narrated via 
    ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Luhay’ah. It says concerning it in al-Taqreeb 
    (1/144): He is truthful at the seventh-rate level but he became confused 
    after his books were burned and the reports of Ibn al-Mubaarak and Ibn Wahb 
    from him are more sound than others. End quote. 

    I say: he was classed as da’eef by some of the huffaaz in 
    absolute terms, and by others with regard to what is narrated from him apart 
    from that which is narrated by those whose names started with “ ‘Abd”. 

    If this the case with regard to the isnaad of the hadeeth, 
    and they did not narrate it except from those in whose narration there is 
    some problem, and the senior imams, such as al-Bukhaari and Muslim, rejected 
    him, even though this hadeeth speaks about an issue in which there is a 
    strong motive to narrate it, this indicates that it has no basis. 

    2 – With regard to its text, its text is odd, because the 
    hadeeth in al-Saheehayn and elsewhere clearly indicate that the first 
    stage of exiting ihraam takes place before circumambulating the House, 
    without stipulating that it should take place before sunset, such as the 
    words of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her): “I used to put perfume 
    on the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he 
    exited ihraam, before he circumambulated the House.” It cannot be subject to 
    conditions such as those mentioned in this odd hadeeth. Hence al-Tahhaawi 
    said in Sharh Ma’aani al-Athaar (2/229), when he quoted the 
    hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with him): This is contrary to 
    the hadeeth of Ibn Luhay’ah which we mentioned at the beginning of the 
    chapter. The hadeeth of Ibn Luhay’ah is stronger, because it is mutawaatir.  
    End quote. 

    3 – With regard to acting upon it, no one among the ummah, 
    imams or common folk, acted upon it except for a small number after the time 
    of the Sahaabah, if the reports narrated concerning that can be accepted. 
    Al-Tabari said in his book al-Qira li Qaasidi Umm al-Qura (p. 472), 
    when he quoted the hadeeth: I do not know of anyone who held their view. End 
    quote. 

    In Sharh al-Muhadhdhab (8/165) al-Nawawi narrated that 
    al-Bayqahi said: I do not know of anyone among the fuqaha’ who held this 
    view. I (al-Nawawi) say it is abrogated and consensus indicates that it is 
    abrogated, for consensus neither abrogates nor is abrogated, rather it is 
    indicative of some abrogator. End quote. 

    Al-Nawawi agreed with al-Bayhaqi that no one has any 
    knowledge of any contrary view, rather consensus may be taken as evidence 
    that this hadeeth is abrogated, i.e., because the ummah did not act upon it. 
    But the claim of al-Nawawi is subject to further discussion because the 
    claim that something is abrogated requires proof for the abrogated thing, 
    and the hadeeth is not proven in the first place so we cannot say that it is 
    abrogated. 

    Some people narrated that ‘Urwah ibn al-Zubayr, one of the 
    seven fuqaha’, was of this view, and perhaps it may be understood from the 
    report narrated from him by al-Tabari in al-Qira (p. 470), that 
    perfume is not permissible for the one who has not circumambulated the 
    Ka’bah after ‘Arafah even if he has cut his hair. Narrated by Sa’eed ibn 
    Mansoor. 

    I say that it is very unlikely for ‘Urwah ibn al-Zubayr to 
    have said the same as is suggested by the hadeeth of Umm Salamah, and for 
    that to have been unknown to the likes of al-Tabari and al-Bayhaqi. 

    What is meant by ‘Urwah’s view is that it is not permissible 
    for a person to put on perfume until he has circumambulated the House. This 
    is a well known view, and the dispute concerning that is well known. The 
    difference between that and what is implied by the hadeeth of Umm Salamah is 
    quite clear: the hadeeth of Umm Salamah indicates that a person may exit 
    ihraam before doing tawaaf, but that if a person delays tawaaf until after 
    sunset on the day of Eid, then he must go back to a state of ihraam. 

    With regard what al-Tabari narrated from ‘Urwah, this 
    indicates that perfume is only permissible after tawaaf, and there is a 
    clear difference between the two views. 

    4 – What it implies is contrary to what is implied by the 
    basic principles of sharee’ah. 

    What it implies is that when a person has completed an act of 
    worship, he can only go back to it with a new intention. This is what makes 
    the hadeeth appear weaker. If it were saheeh then it would be obligatory to 
    follow it, and there is an exception to every rule.  

    This is what Allaah has enabled us to write quickly. 

    I ask Allaah to help us all to follow the right path, and to 
    act in accordance with the Sunnah and the Qur’aan, for He is Able to do 
    that.

    of intercession (on the Day of Resurrection), “… the people will come to Nooh and will say to him, ‘You are the first Messenger whom Allaah sent 
    to the people of the earth…’” So there was no Messenger before Nooh, and there is no Messenger after Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him), because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Muhammad is not the father of any of your 
    men, but he is the Messenger of Allaah and the last (end) of the Prophets”
[al-Ahzaab 33:40]
With regard to the descent of ‘Eesa ibn 
    Maryam (peace be upon him) at the end of time, he will not come down as a Messenger with a new message, rather he will come down as a ruler who 
    rules according to the sharee’ah of Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because ‘Eesa and other Prophets are obliged to 
    believe in Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) when Allaah took the 
    Covenant of the Prophets, saying: ‘Take whatever I gave you from the Book and Hikmah (understanding of the Laws of Allaah), and afterwards there 
    will come to you a Messenger (Muhammad) confirming what is with you; you must, then, believe in him and help him.’ Allaah said: ‘Do you agree (to 
    it) and will you take up My Covenant (which I conclude with you)?’ They said: ‘We agree.’ He said: ‘Then bear witness; and I am with you among the 
    witnesses (for this)’”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:81]
This Messenger who confirmed what was with 
    them is Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as was narrated in saheeh reports from Ibn ‘Abbaas and others.

It has become very common among girls who claim Islamic sisterhood to kiss one another in an exaggerated fashion, such as kissing on the mouth or elsewhere, and they claim that this is part of complete love.
When we explain to them that it is prohibited, they say that there is no Shar`i evidence to show that it is prohibited, and that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to bite the tongue of Zayd ibn Harithah, and that they are prepared to stop doing this if they are shown any Shar`i evidence that it is haram.","It is not permissible for a man to kiss the mouth or hand or anything else of another man, or for a woman to kiss another woman, or to embrace or touch their bodies, etc., if that is done by way of desire. But if that is not done on the mouth, and it is done by way of respect and honouring, or to express emotion upon meeting and parting, then there is nothing wrong with it.","What leads to falling into something forbidden is also forbidden


Islam closes the door to things that lead to immorality


Is kissing on the lips prohibited?","Praise be to Allah.What leads to falling into something forbidden is also forbidden
In order to establish a Shar`i ruling, it is not essential that there be a text which speaks specifically of it in a Quranic verse or a Hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). There is no end to issues and new matters. Hence Islam has set out basic principles which cover thousands of issues and explain their rulings. These major principles include the principle of Sadd Adh-Dhara`i (blocking the means).
In I`lam Al-Muwaqqi`in, Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned ninety-nine texts from the Quran and Sunnah which point to the soundness of this principle. What is meant by “blocking the means” is that everything that is a means that leads to falling into something  forbidden is also forbidden, even if it is permissible in principal. 
Islam closes the door to things that lead to immorality
It is well known that Islam closes the door to things that lead to immorality, whether it is Zina or perversions thereof such as homosexuality or lesbianism . Among the ways in which it has closed the door to that are the following: 

Forbidding men to look at women and vice versa, forbidding a man to be alone with a non-Mahram woman or to shake hands with her, forbidding a woman to travel alone, and so on. Another example is the way in which Islam closes the door to perversion and immorality that may occur between males or between women, so Islam forbids a woman to look at the `Awrah of another woman , or a man to look at the `Awrah of another man ; it forbids sleeping in one bed beneath one cover; and it forbids looking, touching and kissing if that is done with desire, even between one woman and another, or between one man and another. 

It was narrated from Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No man should look at the `Awrah of another man, and no woman should look at the `Awrah of another woman. No man should lie down with another man beneath a single cover, and no woman should lie down with another woman beneath a single cover.” (Narrated by Muslim, 338) 
Is kissing on the lips prohibited? 
The scholars have also clearly stated that this applies even between Mahrams (close blood relatives). They have stated that it is forbidden for a father to kiss his daughter on the mouth and that it is even more forbidden for a brother to kiss his sister on the mouth, let alone other relatives. 
Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a man kissing a woman who is his Mahram. He said: If he has come from a journey and he does not fear that there may be any temptation. Ibn Muflih (may Allah have mercy on him) said: But he should never do that on the mouth; it should be on the cheek or on the head. (Al-Adab Ash-Shar`iyyah, 2/256) 
Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) has mentioned the following limitations with regard to kissing Mahrams: 

There should be a special reason for it, such as having come from a journey.
There should be no risk of Fitnah (temptation). 

Ibn Muflih (may Allah have mercy on him) has explained an important point which is that there should be no kissing on the mouth, rather it should be on the cheek or head, because kissing the mouth has to do with desire, not the kissing of emotion such as that of a father or brother. This is clear to anyone who thinks about it. 
In Al-Iqna` (3/156) it says: 
“There is nothing wrong with one who has come from a journey kissing his female Mahrams, so long as he does not fear that there may be any temptation, but he should not kiss on the mouth, rather it should be on the forehead or head.” 
In Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (13/130) it says: 
“It is not permissible for a man to kiss the mouth or hand or anything else of another man, or for a woman to kiss another woman, or to embrace or touch their bodies, etc., if that is done by way of desire. There is no difference of opinion among the jurists` on this matter … 
But if that is not done on the mouth, and it is done by way of respect and honouring, or to express emotion upon meeting and parting, then there is nothing wrong with it.” 
If these are the words of our scholars and imams with regard to kissing Mahrams such as a daughter, then how can they allow non-Mahram females to kiss one another on the mouth on a daily basis, with no reason such as travelling or a lengthy absence? 
In the answer to question no. 60351 , you will find important details on the ruling on schoolgirls kissing one another on a daily basis. What is said there about it not being allowed applies even more so to kissing on the mouth. 
It should be noted that we cannot find the Hadith mentioned in the question about the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) biting the tongue of Zayd ibn Harithah, and we do not know where this comes from. 
In At-Tirmidhi (2732) it is narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: Zayd ibn Harithah came to Madinah and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was in my house. He came to him and knocked at the door, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood up and embraced him and kissed him. 
But this is a inauthentic Hadith, which was classed as such by Al-Albani in Da`if At-Tirmidhi.

The Standing Committee was asked about a woman whose host covered all the expenses of her Hajj – is her Hajj valid?  
They replied: 
The validity of her doing the obligatory Hajj is not affected by the fact that she has not spent any of her own money on it, or that she only spent a little and someone else paid most of the expenses of her Hajj. Therefore if her Hajj fulfilled the conditions and she did all the essential parts of Hajj, then she has fulfilled the obligation of Hajj, even if someone else covered the expenses.

36847,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36847,Mistakes made when cutting the hair or shaving the head,What are the mistakes that some people make when shaving their heads or cutting their hair?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Among the mistakes that are made when cutting the hair or shaving the head are the following: 
-1-  
Some people shave part of the head completely with a razor, and leave the rest. I have seen that with my own eyes. I saw a man doing saa’i between al-Safa and al-Marwah, and he had shaved half of his head completely and left the rest of his hair. I grabbed him and said to him, “Why did you do that?” He said, “I did it because I want to do ‘Umrah twice, so I shaved half for the first ‘Umrah and left half for this ‘Umrah.” This is ignorance and misguidance that none of the scholars ever suggested. 
-2- 
Some people, when they want to exit ihram of ‘Umrah, cut a few hairs on their head, on one side only. This is contrary to the apparent meaning of the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
“…(some) having your heads shaved, and (some) having your head hair cut short…” [al-Fath 48:27]
The shortening of the hair should have an obvious effect on the head. It is known that cutting one or two or three hairs does not have any effect and it is not apparent that the pilgrim who has done ‘Umrah has in fact shortened his hair. So he is going against the apparent meaning of the verse. 
The remedy for these two mistakes is for the one who wants to shave his head to shave all of it, and to shorten the hair all over the head if he wants to cut it, and not to cut just one or two hairs. 
-3- 
There are some people who, when they have finished saa’i, if they cannot find anyone to shave their heads or cut their hair, they go back to their houses and exit ihram, and put on regular clothes, then they shave their heads or cut their hair after that. This is a serious mistake, because a person cannot exit ihram without shaving his head or cutting his hair, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, when during the Farewell Pilgrimage he commanded those of his companions who had not brought a hadiy (sacrificial animal) to make it ‘Umrah, and he said, “Let him cut his hair then exit ihram.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1691; Muslim, 1229.  This indicates that one cannot exit ihram until after cutting the hair. 
Based on this, if a pilgrim finishes saa’i and cannot find someone to cut his hair, he should remain in ihram until he shaves his head or cuts his hair; it is not permissible for him to exit ihram before that. If we assume that a person did that out of ignorance and exited ihram before shaving or cutting his hair, thinking that it was permissible to do so, there is no blame on him because of his ignorance, but when he finds out about that he should take off his regular clothes and put on his ihram garments, because it is not permissible to continue exiting ihram when he knows that it is not permissible. Then when he has shaved his head or cut his hair, he may exit ihram.”",From Daleel al-Akhta’ allati yaqa’ fiha al-Haaj wa’l-Mu’tamir (Mistakes made by pilgrims performing Hajj and ‘Umrah)

Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
If a person interrupts his tawaaf for a reason, such as one who has done three circuits then the iqaamah for prayer is given, so he goes and prays and then comes back, he should start from where he was, and he does not have to go back to the Black Stone; rather he should continue from where he was and complete his tawaaf. This is contrast to what some scholars say, who say that he has to start at the Black Stone. The correct view is that he does not have to do that, as a group of scholars have said. Similarly if a bier is brought in and he offers the funeral prayer, or someone stops him and speaks to him, or there is overcrowding, and so on. Then he should complete his tawaaf and there is nothing wrong with that.

Rather what the scholars mean by wearing things that are stitched is that which is made to fit the limbs and is worn in the manner in which such garments are usually worn, such as shirts, pants and T-shirts, etc. 
The scholars did not mean that which has stitches in it. Hence if a person were to enter ihram in a patched rida (upper garment) and a patched izar, there would be nothing wrong with that, even though part of it is stitched to another part.”

    for them to pray in congregation with the imam, because it is all one place,

We see some actions which we denounce such as visiting graves after the Eid prayer and staying up to worship on the night of Eid….,,,"Praise be to Allah.As Eid is approaching, we would like to point out some things that some people do out of ignorance of the laws of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). These include the following: 
1 – The belief of some that it is prescribed to spend the night of Eid in worship. 
Some people believe that it is prescribed to spend the night of Eid in worship. This is a kind of innovation (bid’ah) that is not proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Rather it was narrated in a da’eef (weak) hadeeth which says, “Whoever stays up on the night of Eid, his heart will not die on the day when hearts die.” This hadeeth is not saheeh. It was narrated via two isnaads, one of which is mawdoo’ (fabricated) and the other is da’eef jiddan (very weak). See Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth al-Da’eefah wa’l-Mawdoo’ah by al-Albaani, 520, 521. 
It is not prescribed to single out the night of Eid to pray qiyaam to the exclusion of all other nights, unlike the one whose habit it is to pray qiyaam, in which case there is nothing wrong with him praying qiyaam on the night of Eid. 
2 – Visiting graves on the two Eid days. 
This is contrary to the purpose of Eid which is to express joy and happiness, and it goes against the teaching of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the actions of the salaf. It comes under the general meaning of the Prophet’s prohibition on visiting graves on a specific day and making that like a festival, as the scholars stated. 
See Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz wa Bida’uha by al-Albaani, p. 219, 258. 
3 – Forsaking the jamaa’ah and sleeping late and missing the prayer. 
Unfortunately you see some of the Muslims missing the prayer and forsaking the jamaa’ah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:  “The covenant that stands between us and them is the prayer; whoever forsakes it is a kaafir.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2621; al-Nasaa’i, 463; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
And he said: “The most burdensome prayers for the hypocrites are the ‘Isha’ and Fajr prayers. If they knew (what goodness) there is in them, they would come to them even if they had to crawl. I had thought of ordering the call to prayer to be given, then I would tell a man to lead the people in prayer, then I would go, taking some men with me carrying bundles of wood, to people who do not attend the prayer, and would burn their houses down around them.” Narrated by Muslim, 651. 
4 – Women mixing with men in the prayer place, the streets and elsewhere, and crowding together with men in those places. 
This is a source of great fitnah (temptation) and serious danger. Both women and men should be warned against that, and the necessary means should be taken to prevent that as much as possible. Men and youth should not leave the prayer place or the mosque until after the women have dispersed completely. 
5 – Some women going out wearing perfume and makeup, and without veils. 
This is a problem which is widespread, and many people take this matter lightly. Allah is the One Whose help we seek. Some women – may Allah guide them – even dress up in their finest clothes and put on the best perfume when they go to the mosque to pray Taraaweeh or go to the Eid prayers, etc. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Any woman who puts on perfume and passes by people so that they can smell her fragrance, is an adulteress.” Narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 5126; al-Tirmidhi, 2783; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb, 2019. 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are two types of the people of Hell whom I have not seen. People with whips like the tails of cattle with which they beat the people, and women who are clothed yet naked, going astray and leading others astray, with their heads looking like the humps of camels, leaning to one side. They will not enter Paradise nor even smell its fragrance, although its fragrance may be detected from such and such a distance.” Narrated by Muslim, 2128. 
The guardians of women must fear Allah with regard to those who are under their care, and fulfil the duty of protecting and maintaining that Allah has enjoined upon them, because, 
“Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other”
[al-Nisa’ 4:34 – interpretation of the meaning]
So they must guide them and show them that which will lead to their salvation and their safety in this world and in the Hereafter, by means of keeping away from that which Allah has forbidden and striving for that which will bring them closer to Allah. 
6 – Listening to singing and haram things. 
Among the evil things that are widespread in these times is music and singing.  They have become very widespread and people take this matter lightly. It is on TV and radio, in cars, homes and marketplaces. There is no power and no strength except with Allah. Even cell phones are not free of this evil. There are companies which compete in putting the latest music on the ringers of their cell phones, and in this way music has even reached the mosques, may Allah protect us… This is a great problem and a great evil whereby music is heard in the houses of Allah. See question no. 34217 . This confirms the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “There will be among my ummah people who will regard adultery, silk, alcohol and musical instruments as permissible.” Narrated by al-Bukhari.
 See questions no. 5000 , 34432 .
 The Muslim has to fear Allah and realize that the blessing of Allah means that he is obliged to give thanks to Him. It is not gratitude for the Muslim to disobey his Lord, when He is the One Who has bestowed this blessing upon him.
 One of the righteous passed by some people who were engaged in idle entertainment on the day of Eid and said to them, “If you did well in Ramadan, this is not the way to give thanks for that. If you did badly in Ramadan, this is not the way that the one who did badly should behave.”

    that is haraam and forbidden. Abu Ya’la and al-Haafiz al-Diya’ narrated in al-Mukhtaarah that ‘Ali ibn al-Husayn (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) saw a man entering through a gap at the grave of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and making du’aa’. He 
    told him not to do that and said, “Shall I not tell you a hadeeth that I heard from my father from my grandfather from the Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? ‘Do not take my grave as a place of festivity (which you visit repeatedly) and do not take your 
    houses as graves. Send blessings upon me for your greeting will reach me no matter where you are.’” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2042; classed as 
    saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 1796.

Some of those who are unable to go to Madeenah send their salaams to the Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with some visitors, some of whom stand and convey these salaams. This is an innovated action that 
    has been made up. Those who send salaams and those who convey them should refrain from doing so, because there is no need for that, as the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Send blessings upon me for your greeting will reach me no matter where you are.” 
And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “Allaah has angels on earth who travel around conveying to me the salaams of my ummah.” Narrated by Ahmad, 1/441; al-Nasaa’i, 
    1282; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 2170.

Repeatedly visiting his grave and going there 
    a great deal, such as visiting after every obligatory prayer, or every day after a specific prayer. This is going against the words of the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “Do not take my grave as a place of festivity (which you visit repeatedly).” Ibn Hajar 
    al-Haythami said in Sharh al-Mishkaat: “Eid (translated here as “a place of festivity) is the name of one of the festivals, and it was said 
    that it means returning and repeating, until it becomes a habit [‘aadah]. What is meant is: do not make my grave a place to which you have 
    the habit of coming back repeatedly and often. Hence he said, ‘Send blessings upon me for your greeting will reach me no matter where you are,’ 
    because that is sufficient and there is no need to visit his grave frequently.” 
In the book al-Jaami’ li’l-Bayaan by 
    Ibn Rushd it says: “Maalik (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about a stranger who comes to the grave of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) each day. He said, ‘That is not right,’ and quoted the hadeeth, ‘O Allaah, do not make my grave an idol that is 
    worshipped.’” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Tahdheer al-Saajid min Ittikhaadh al-Quboor Masaajid, p. 24-26. 
Ibn Rushd said: “So he regarded it as makrooh 
    to pass by it a great deal to send salaam on him, and to come there every day, lest the grave become like a mosque to which people come every day 
    to pray. The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade that when he said, ‘O Allaah, do not make my mosque an 
    idol.’” See al-Bayaan wa’l-Tahseel by Ibn Rushd, 18/444-445. 
Al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad was asked about people of 
    Madeenah who stand by the grave one or more times a day, and they send salaams and make du’aa’ for a while. He said, “I have not heard of this 
    from any of the fuqaha’, and nothing is good for the latter generations of this ummah except that which was good for its first generations. I have 
    not heard that any of the first generations of the ummah used to do that.” Al-Shifa bi Ta’reef Huqooq al-Mustafa, 2/676.

Turning to face the grave from all sides of 
    the mosque, or turning to face it whenever one enters the mosque or finishes a prayer, and putting one's hands on one's sides and inclining the 
    head when sending salaams upon him, All of these are widespread and well-known innovations (bid’ah) which go against sharee’ah. 
Fear Allaah, O slaves of Allaah, and beware 
    of all innovations and actions that go against sharee’ah. Beware of whims and desires and blind imitation, and follow true guidance. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Is he who is on a clear proof from his 
    Lord, like those for whom their evil deeds that they do are beautified for them, while they follow their own lusts (evil desires)?”

Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We have not sent you (O Muhammad) except as a giver of glad tidings and a warner to all mankind” [Saba’ 34:28]
So the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did as he was commanded. He called his people and those who were around him first, and when Islam became established in Arabia, and the Arabs entered the religion of Allaah in crowds, he began to call others, and he sent his messengers and envoys to the kings and rulers. 
Muslim (1774) narrated from Anas that the Prophet of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wrote to Chosroes, Caesar, the Negus and to every tyrant, calling them to Allaah. This was not the Negus for whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) offered the funeral prayer. 
Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath: 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wrote to the Negus who became Muslim and for whom he offered the funeral prayer when he died, then he wrote to the Negus who came to the throne after him and who was a kaafir. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Hudhaafah to Chosroes; Dahyah to Caesar the king of Byzantium; Saleet ibn ‘Amr to Hawdhah ibn ‘Ali in al-Yamaamah; al-‘Ala’ ibn al-Hadrami to al-Mundhir ibn Saawa in Hajar; ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas to Jayfar and ‘Abbaad, the two sons of al-Jalandi in ‘Ammaan; Shujaa’ ibn Wahb to Ibn Abu Shamir al-Ghassaani; and Haatib ibn Abi Balta’ah to al-Muqawqis. He wrote to the Negus and he became Muslim, and when he died, he wrote to the Negus who succeeded him and sent ‘Amr ibn Umayyah to him. 
The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) called them to Islam and to worship Allaah alone. 
See Zaad al-Ma’aad by Ibn al-Qayyim (3/688-697), where he quotes the letters of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the responses of those kings. 
The text of the letter of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to Heraclius the king of Byzantium was as follows: 
“In the Name of Allaah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. From Muhammad the slave and Messenger of Allaah to Heraclius the ruler of Byzantium. Peace be upon those who follow true guidance. I call you with the call of Islam. Become Muslim and you will be safe, and Allaah will grant you a two-fold reward, but if you turn away, upon you will be the sins of the Areesiyyeen (peasants i.e., his followers and subjects who would follow him in kufr).
‘Say (O Muhammad): “O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allaah (Alone), and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allaah. Then, if they turn away, say: “Bear witness that we are Muslims”’ [Aal ‘Imraan 3:64].” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7; Muslim, 1773. 
None of these kings believed except for the first Negus, the king of Abyssinia (Ethiopia), and the king of ‘Ammaan and his brother. 
Heraclius would have become Muslim, were it not that he feared what his people would do to him. He was afraid that he would lose his kingdom. The same was true of the others, who preferred the life of this world to the Hereafter, so ultimately they were the losers. 
It is narrated in al-Bukhaari and Muslim, in the hadeeth referred to above, that when Heraclius asked Abu Sufyaan about the attributes of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the message to which he was calling people, he acknowledged that he was indeed the Messenger of Allaah. He said:
“If what you say is true, then he is a Prophet, and he will soon occupy the place beneath these two feet of mine. I knew that he would emerge, but I did not think that he would be from among you. If I knew that I could reach him definitely, I would have done my utmost to go to meet him, and if I were with him, I would wash his feet.” 
This indicates that he knew that he would not be safe from being killed if he were to migrate to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It was narrated that he said: “I know that (i.e., what they said about the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) is correct, but I cannot do anything. If I do anything my kingdom will be lost and the Romans (Byzantines) will kill me.” And it was also narrated that he said: “By Allaah, I know that he is a Prophet who has been sent, but I fear the Byzantines and what they will do to me. Were it not for that, I would follow him.” 
Ibn al-Qayyim mentions in Zaad al-Ma’aad (3/694) that when Heraclius heard news of the Negus becoming Muslim, he said: “By Allaah, were it not for the sake of holding on to my kingdom, I would have done what he has done.” 
His fear for himself and his kingdom prevented him from becoming Muslim and migrating to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
But if Heraclius had really understood the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the letter that he sent to him: “Become Muslim and you will be safe,” and he had understood that in general terms as applying both to this world and the Hereafter, he would have been safe from all that he feared if he had become Muslim. But guidance is in the hand of Allaah. The Negus, the king of Abyssinia, became Muslim and remained in power.

Or does that count as the obligatory Hajj?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Hajj of a minor child is valid, as has already been stated in Question no. 13636. But it does not count as the obligatory Hajj. Rather when the person reached adolescence he has to do Hajj again when he is able to.
 This is the view of the majority of the scholars from all four schools of law; indeed it was narrated that there is consensus on this point.
 This is because of the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Any child who does Hajj then reaches adolescence has to do another Hajj.” Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah and classed as saheeh by Ibn Hajar in al-Talkhees, 2/220, and by al-Albaani in al-Irwa’, 4/159.
 Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni, 5/44: Ibn al-Mundhir said: The scholars are agreed – apart from those who held odd views and whose opinions are not significant – that if a child does Hajj when he is small, and if a slave does Hajj when he is still enslaved, then the child reaches adolescence and the slave gains his freedom, they have to do the obligatory Hajj, if they have the means to do so.
 And it says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah:
 Hajj and ‘Umrah done by one who has not yet reached adolescence is considered as voluntary, and does not count as the obligatory Hajj and ‘Umrah of Islam.

36863,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36863,Islamic Guidelines for Visitors to the Prophet’s Mosque,I know a group of brothers who are going to visit the Prophet’s Mosque after they do Hajj this year. They would like some advice and guidelines from you.,,,"Praise be to Allah.O you who come to the City of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), you have come to a good place and you are going to earn great reward. May Allaah accept your righteous deeds and fulfil your greatest hopes. Welcome to the land of Hijrah and victory, the land of the Chosen Prophet, the land to which the righteous Sahaabah migrated and the home of the Ansaar. 
There follow a few words of advice to those who want to visit the Mosque of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): 
1 – O you who come to Madeenah, you are in a place which, after Makkah, is the best and noblest of all places, so respect it as it should be respected; honour its sanctity and holiness and observe the best etiquette therein. Know that Allaah has warned of the severest punishment for those who commit evil therein. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Madeenah is a Haram (sanctuary), so whoever commits evil therein or gives protection to an evildoer, the curse of Allaah, the angels and all of mankind may be upon him. Allaah will not accept any obligatory or naafil deed from him on the Day of Resurrection.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1867; Muslim, 1370. 
So whoever commits any evil action or offers protection to any evildoer who seeks his help is exposing himself to a humiliating punishment and the wrath of the Lord of the Worlds. 
One of the most serious of evil deeds that violate its purity is openly doing acts of bid’ah and spoiling its atmosphere with myths and false ideas, and contaminating its pure land with the spread of articles which promote bid’ah, books which contain shirk, and all kinds of reprehensible and haraam actions which go against Islamic sharee’ah. The evildoer and the one who gives him protection are equally guilty of sin. 
2 – Visiting the Prophet’s Mosque is an act that is Sunnah; it is not an obligatory action and has nothing to do with Hajj, nor is it an action that is required in order for Hajj to be complete.  All the ahaadeeth which say that it is connected to Hajj or that say that visiting the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is  connected to Hajj are fabricated and false. Whoever travels to Madeenah for the purpose of visiting the Mosque and praying therein, his intention is acceptable and his efforts will be rewarded.  Whoever travels there only for the purpose of visiting the graves and seeking the help of their occupants, his intention is haraam and his actions are reprehensible. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do not travel to visit any mosques except three: al-Masjid al-Haraam [in Makkah], this Mosque of mine [in Madeenah] and al-Masjid al-Aqsa [in Jerusalem].” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1189; Muslim, 1397. 
It was narrated from Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The best places to which a person may travel are this Mosque of mine, and the Ancient House (i.e., the Ka’bah).” Narrated by Ahmad, 3/350; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 1648. 
3 – Prayers offered in the Mosque of Madeenah bring a multiple reward, both obligatory and naafil prayers according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “One prayer in this Mosque of mine is better than one thousand prayers offered anywhere else, except al-Masjid al-Haraam.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1190; Muslim, 1394. 
But offering naafil prayers at home is better than offering them in the mosque, even if the reward for offering them in the Mosque is multiplied, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “The best prayers are those that a man offers in his home, apart from the prescribed [obligatory] prayers.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 731; Muslim, 781. 
4 – The visitor to this great Mosque should note that it is not permissible to seek blessing (barakah) from any part of the Prophet’s Mosque, such as the pillars, walls, doors, mihraab or minbar, by touching or kissing them. It is also not permitted to seek blessing from the Prophet’s hujrah (chamber) by touching it, kissing it, or wiping one's clothes against it or to circumambulate it. Whoever does any of these things has to repent and not repeat it. 
5 – It is prescribed for the one who visits the Prophet’s Mosque to pray two rak’ahs in the Rawdah or whatever he wants of naafil prayers, because it is proven that there is virtue in doing so. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The area between my house and my minbar is one of the gardens (riyaad, sing. rawdah) of Paradise, and my minbar is on my cistern (hawd)” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1196; Muslim, 1391. 
And it was narrated that Yazeed ibn Abi ‘Ubayd said: “I used to come with Salamah ibn al-Akwa’ and he would pray by the pillar which was by the mus-haf, i.e. in the Rawdah. I said, ‘O Abu Muslim, I see that you are keen to pray by this pillar!’ He said, ‘I saw that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was keen to pray here.’” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 502; Muslim, 509. 
Being keen to pray in al-Rawdah does not justify being aggressive towards people or pushing the weak aside, or stepping over their necks. 
6 – It is prescribed for the visitor to Madeenah and for the one who lives there to go to the Mosque of Quba’ and pray there, following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and seeking the reward of ‘Umrah. It was narrated that Sahl ibn Haneef said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever goes out until he comes to this mosque – meaning the Mosque of Quba’ – and prays there, that will be equivalent to ‘Umrah.” Narrated by Ahmad, 3/437; al-Nasaa’i, 699; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 1180, 1181. 
According to Ibn Maajah: “Whoever purifies himself in his house, then comes to the Mosque of Quba’ and prays there, he will have the reward of ‘Umrah.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 1412. 
In al-Saheehayn it is narrated that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to go to the mosque of Quba’ every Saturday, walking or riding, and he would pray two rak’ahs there. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1191; Muslim, 1399 
7 – For the visitor to Madeenah, it is not prescribed to visit any other mosques in the city apart from these two, the Mosque of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the Mosque of Quba’. It is not prescribed for the visitor or anyone else to head for a particular spot, hoping for blessing or to worship Allaah in that place, when there is no evidence from the Qur’aan or Sunnah concerning visiting that place and no evidence that the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) did that. 
It is not prescribed to go to the places and mosques in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or the Sahaabah prayed in order to pray there or to worship Allaah by offering du’aa’s there etc., because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not enjoin that or encourage people to visit these places. It was narrated that al-Ma’roor ibn Suwayd (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: We went out with ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, and we passed by a mosque on the way. The people hastened to pray there, and ‘Umar said, “What is the matter with them?” They said, “This is a mosque in which the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed.” ‘Umar said, “O people, those who came before you were doomed because they followed such practices, until they established places of worship in such locations. If a time for prayer comes when you are there, then pray, and if it is not the time for prayer, then move on.” Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf, 7550. 
When ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab heard that there were people who came to the tree under which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had received the bay’ah (oath of allegiance), he ordered that it be cut down. Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf, 7545. 
8 – It is prescribed for men who are visiting the Prophet’s Mosque to visit the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the graves of his two companions Abu Bakr and ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them), and to send salaams upon them and make du’aa’ for them. But for women it is not permissible for them to visit graves according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, because of the hadeeth narrated by Abu Dawood (3236), al-Tirmidhi (3236) and Ibn Maajah (1575) from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed the women who visit graves. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Islaah al-Masaajid. 
And al-Tirmidhi (1056) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed women who visit graves. Al-Tirmidhi said it is hasan saheeh. It was also narrated by Ahmad, 2/337; Ibn Maajah, 1574; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 843; Mishkaat al-Masaabeeh, 1770. 
The way in which the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is to be visited is that the visitor should come to the grave and face it and say “Al-salaamu ‘alayka ya Rasool-Allaah (Peace be upon you, O Messenger of Allaah).” Then he should move about a yard to his right and say salaams to Abu Bakr by saying, “Al-salaamu ‘alayka ya Aba Bakr.” Then he should move a little further to his right, about a yard, and say salaams to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, by saying, ‘Al-salaamu alayka ya ‘Umar.” 
9 – It is prescribed for men who are visiting Madeenah to visit the people buried in Baqee’ al-Gharqad and the martyrs of Uhud, to send salaams on them and to make du’aa’ for them. It was narrated that Buraydah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to teach them, when they went out to the graveyards, to say, “Al-salaamu ‘alaykum ahl al-diyaar min al-mu’mineen wa’l-muslimeen, wa innaa in sha Allaah bikum laahiqoon. Nas’al Allaah lana wa lakum al-‘aafiyah. (Peace be upon you, O dwellers of these abodes, believers and Muslims. We will, when Allaah wills, join you. We ask Allaah to grant salvation to us and you).”  
10 – Visiting the graves is prescribed for two great purposes: 
(i)So that the visitor may receive a lesson and reminder.
(ii)So that the person visited will benefit from the du’aa’s and prayers for mercy and forgiveness that are offered for him.
Permission to visit graves is subject to the condition that no false words are spoken, the worst of which are shirk and kufr. It was narrated from Buraydah from his father that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I used to forbid you to visit graves, but now whoever wants to visit them let him do so, but do not utter any falsehood.” Narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 2033; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 886. 
Muslim narrated this also (no. 977), but without the phrase, “but do not utter any falsehood.” 
It is not permitted to circumambulate these graves or any others, or to pray towards them or amongst them, or to perform acts of worship beside them such as reading Qur’aan, making du’aa’, etc, because these are means of associating others in worship with the Lord of all creation and taking them (graves) as places of worship , even if no mosque is built over them. It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah and ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: When death was approaching the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), he put a cloak over his face, and when he felt hot he removed it and said, “May Allaah’s curse be upon the Jews and Christians, for they took the graves of their Prophets as places of worship” – warning against doing what they did. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 436; Muslim, 529. 
And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The most evil of people are those upon whom the Hour will come when they are still alive and those who take graves as places of worship.” Narrated by Ahmad, 1/405. It is also narrated by al-Bukhaari in a mu’allaq report in Kitaab al-Fitan, Baab Zuhoor al-Fitan, 7067. Also narrated by Muslim in Kitaab al-Fitan, Baab Qurb al-Saa’ah, 2949, without mentioning the taking of graves as places of worship. 
It was narrated that Abu Marthad al-Ghanawi said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, “Do not sit on graves or pray facing towards them.” Narrated by Muslim, 972. 
And it was narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “All of the earth is a place of prayer apart from graveyards and bathrooms.” Narrated by Ahmad, 3/83; al-Tirmidhi, 317; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 1/320. 
According to a hadeeth narrated by Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade people to pray between graves. Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 1698. Al-Haythami said in Majma’ al-Zawaa’id (2/27), Its men are the men of saheeh. 
It is not permissible to prostrate on graves, rather that is a kind of idolatry and ignorance, and a sign of intellectual deviation and backwardness. It is not permissible for the visitor to those graves or anyone else to seek blessings from them by touching them, kissing them, clinging with any part of the body to them, or to seek healing from its dirt by rubbing one’s hands or face with it or to take anything from them in order to dilute it with water and wash oneself with it. It is not permissible for visitors to the grave or others to bury any part of their hair or body or handkerchiefs in them, or to put their pictures or anything else that they may have with them in their soil in order to seek blessing (barakah). It is not permissible to throw money or any kind of food such as grains etc. on them. Whoever does any of these things has to repent, and not do it again. It is not permissible to perfume them, or to swear to Allaah by their occupants. It is not permissible to ask of Allaah by virtue of their occupants or their status, rather that is a haraam kind of beseeching Allaah and is one of the means that lead to shirk. It is not allowed to build up the graves or erect any structure over them, because this is a means of veneration that leads to shirk. It is not permissible to sell food or perfume etc to one who it is known will use them for such seriously wrong actions. 
Seeking the help of the dead or asking them for support or calling upon them and asking them to meet needs and to help alleviates calamity and to bring benefits and ward off hardships are all forms of major shirk which put a person beyond the pale of Islam and make him a worshipper of idols, because no one can relieve a person of worries and distress except Allaah alone with no partner or associate. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Such is Allaah, your Lord; His is the kingdom. And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmeer (the thin membrane over the date stone).
If you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your call; and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammad) like Him Who is the All‑Knower (of everything”
[Faatir 35:13-14] 
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘Call upon those — besides Him whom you pretend [to be gods like angels, ‘Eesa (Jesus), ‘Uzayr (Ezra) and others]. They have neither the power to remove the adversity from you nor even to shift it from you to another person.’
Those whom they call upon [like ‘Eesa (Jesus) ‑ son of Maryam (Mary), ‘Uzayr (Ezra), angel and others] desire (for themselves) means of access to their Lord (Allaah), as to which of them should be the nearest; and they [‘Eesa (Jesus), ‘Uzayr (Ezra), angels and others] hope for His Mercy and fear His Torment.

36864,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36864,Intimacy with a woman who is menstruating,"I read somewhere that during the period of Menstrual cycle, the part below the waist of a Woman is haram to do intercourse with, while the part above the waist is halal and there is nothing wrong taking part in sex with husband with upper part only? Is this correct in the light of true ahadeeth?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.What you have read is not correct. The correct view is that the man may be intimate with his wife when she is menstruating in all ways apart from intercourse.
 The evidence for that has already been explained in the answer to question no. 36722.
 Many of the scholars were of the view that it is haraam for a man to be intimate with his wife during her menses with regard to the area between the navel and the knees, and they quoted evidence for that, but this view has some flaws, for example : 
1 – The report narrated by Abu Dawood (213) from Mu’aadh ibn Jabal who said: “I asked the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) what it is permissible for a man to do with his wife when she is menstruating. He said, ‘Whatever is above the izaar (waist wrapper), but refraining from that is better.’”  
This hadeeth is da’eef, and was not proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
Abu Dawood said: It is not strong. It was classed as da’eef by al-‘Iraaqi as it says in ‘Awn al-Ma’bood. And it was classed as da’eef by al-Albaani in Da’eef Abi Dawood, 36. 
2 – Ahmad (87) narrated from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab that he asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “What can a man do with his wife when she is menstruating?” The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whatever is above the izaar.” 
Ahmad Shaakir said in Tahqeeq al-Musnad (86): its isnaad is da’eef (weak) because there is a missing link in it.  
3 – Abu Dawood (212) also narrated from Haraam ibn Hakeem that his paternal uncle asked the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “What is it permissible for me to do with my wife when she is menstruating?” He said, “Whatever is above the izaar.” 
The scholars differed concerning this hadeeth. Ibn al-Qayyim narrated in Tahdheeb al-Sunan that some of the huffaaz regarded it as da’eef, and he concurred with that. It was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 197. 
Even if the hadeeth is saheeh, it does not constitute evidence that this is not permissible to engage in intimacy between the navel and the knees, because it is possible to reconcile between this hadeeth and other ahaadeeth which state that such intimacy is possible in one of the following ways: 
1-It means that this is mustahabb to avoid the site of menstruation, not that it is obligatory to do so.
2-It may be interpreted as applying to the one who is not able to control himself, because if he is allowed to be intimate with the area between the thighs, for example, he may not be able to control himself and may have intercourse in the vagina, so he would be doing something haraam, either because he is lacking in religious commitment, or because his desire is too strong. So the ahaadeeth which indicate that it is permissible apply to the one who can control himself and the ahaadeeth which indicate that it is not allowed apply to the one who fears that he may fall into haraam.

If a man has intercourse with his wife, they must both do Ghusl even if there is no ejaculation . 
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When a man sits between the four parts (arms and legs of his wife) and has intercourse with her, then Ghusl is obligatory .” (Narrated by Al-Bukhaari, 291 and Muslim, 525 who added: “Even if he does not ejaculate .”
 Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim: 
“What this Hadith means is that the obligation of Ghusl does not depend on the emission of semen, rather when the tip of the penis disappears into the vagina, then Ghusl becomes obligatory for both the man and the woman. There is no dispute concerning this matter today, although there was a difference of opinion among the Companions and those who came after them. Then there arose consensus on what we have mentioned.”
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“It is clear that Ghusl is required in this case , even if he does not ejaculate. This is something that is not known to many people, so you may find that this has happened to a couple, but they do not do Ghusl, especially if they are young and have not learned much. This is based on their idea that Ghusl is only required when ejaculation takes place, but this is wrong.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 1/223) 
It says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (5/314): 
“Among the things that make Ghusl obligatory for a Muslim are: the emission of semen whilst sleeping; the disappearing of the tip of the penis into the vagina even if no ejaculation takes place; the emission of semen with pleasure when one is awake, even if no intercourse takes place; and menses and postpartum bleeding in the case of a woman, in which case she must do Ghusl when the bleeding stops .”

Yes, it is permissible to delay tawaf al-ifadah and then do one tawaf which will suffice for both tawaf al-ifadah and the farewell tawaf . But it is better to do two tawafs, one for ifadah and one for farewell. 
Doing tawaf al-ifadah on the day of ‘Eid
Even better than all of that is to do tawaf al-ifadah on the day of ‘Eid, after stoning Jamrat al-‘Aqabah and slaughtering the hadiy (sacrificial animal), and cutting your hair or shaving your head. Then when you want to leave Makkah, you should do the farewell tawaf. This is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz was asked about this matter and he said: 
“There is nothing wrong with that, if a person delays tawaf al-ifadah and when he wants to leave he does tawaf after he has stoned the jamarat and finished everything. Then if he does tawaf al-ifadah that will suffice for the farewell tawaf as well. But if he does both – tawaf al-ifadah and the farewell tawaf , that is even better, but if he does just one and intends it as the tawaf of Hajj , that will be sufficient.” (Fatawa Ibn Baz, 17/332)",Islam Q&A

But there may be cases where giving in charity is better than voluntary Hajj, such as if the money is spent on jihad, or da`wah or on needy people.",,"Praise be to Allah.The basic principle is that a nafl Hajj is better than giving the money that would be used for this Hajj in charity. But there may be cases where giving the money in charity is better than doing a nafl Hajj, such as if the money is spent on jihad for the sake of Allah, or for calling people to Allah (da’wah), or on needy people, especially if they are relatives. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in al-Ikhtiyarat (p. 206) 
“Hajj in the prescribed manner is better than charity that is not obligatory. But if a person has needy relatives, then giving charity to them is better. The same applies if there are people who need his help. But if both of them are voluntary, then Hajj is better because it is an act of worship which is both physical and financial. 
By the same token, udhiyah (sacrifice on ‘Eid al-Adha) and ‘aqiqah (sacrifice offered when a baby is born) is better than giving the price of the animal in charity. But that is subject to the condition that the person does religious duties on the way, abstains from haram things, offers all five daily prayers, speaks the truth, fulfils trusts and does not violate the rights of anyone.” 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
Hajj and ‘Umrah are better than giving the equivalent amount of money in charity, for the one whose intention is sincerely for the sake of Allah Alone and does these rituals in the manner prescribed in shari’ah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘From one ‘Umrah to the next is an expiation for whatever came in between, and an accepted Hajj brings no less a reward than Paradise.’ (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1773; Muslim, 1349)
And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “‘Umrah in Ramadan is equivalent to Hajj.’ (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1782; Muslim, 1256) 
And he said: 
“Whoever has done the obligatory Hajj, it is better for him to donate the expense of his second Hajj to the mujahidin who are striving for the sake of Allah, because when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked which deed is best, he said, ‘Belief in Allah and His Messenger.’ He was asked, ‘Then what?’ He said, ‘Jihad for the sake of Allah.’ He was asked, ‘Then what?’ He said, ‘An accepted Hajj.’ (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 26; Muslim, 83)
So Hajj comes after jihad. What is meant here is the nafl Hajj , because the obligatory Hajj is one of the pillars of Islam, so long as one is able to do it. In al-Sahihayn it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever equips a warrior has taken part in the military campaign, and whoever takes care of his family (in his absence) has taken part in the military campaign.’ Undoubtedly the mujahidin who are striving for the sake of Allah are in the greatest need of material help, and spending on them is better than spending on a voluntary Hajj, because of the two hadith quoted above and others.” 
And he said: 
“It is better for the one who has already done the obligatory Hajj and ‘Umrah to spend the equivalent of the cost of a voluntary Hajj and ‘Umrah helping the mujahidin who are fighting for the sake of Allah, because jihad as prescribed in shari’ah is better than a voluntary Hajj and a voluntary ‘Umrah.” 
Shaykh Ibn Baz was asked: Is it better to donate money to build a mosque or to do Hajj on behalf of one's parents? 
He replied: 
“If there is an urgent need to build a mosque, then he should donate his Hajj expenses voluntarily to help build the mosque because that will be of greater and more lasting benefit and will help the Muslims to establish regular prayers in congregation. 
But if the need to spend the expenses of Hajj – I mean a voluntary Hajj – on building the mosque is not urgent because there are others who can help with that who are not planning to go for Hajj, then his spending on Hajj on behalf of his parents, whether he does that himself or appoints a trustworthy person to do that, is better in sha Allah. But he should not do one Hajj for both of them, rather he should do one Hajj for each of them separately.”  (See Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 16/368-372)
 Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: 
“What we think is that spending the money on jihad is better than spending it on a voluntary Hajj, because the nafl of jihad is better than the nafl of Hajj.” (Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 2/677)

Is there a difference between boys and girls?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Human urine is impure and must be cleaned off, whether it comes from a child or an adult, male or female, except it is less serious in the case of a baby boy who is not yet eating food, in which case sprinkling water is sufficient to purify it. Al-Bukhaari (223) and Muslim (287) narrated from Umm Qays bint Mihsan (may Allah be pleased with her) that she brought a son of hers who was not yet eating food to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sat him on his lap, and he urinated on his garment, so he called for some water and sprinkled it, but did not wash it. 
Al-Tirmidhi (610) and Ibn Maajah (525) narrated from ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said concerning the urine of an infant boy: “Sprinkle the urine of a boy and wash the urine of a girl.” Qataadah said: This applies so long as they are not eating food; if they are eating food then it must be washed in both cases. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
This hadeeth indicates that there is a difference between the urine of boys and girls. In the case of boys’ urine it is sufficient to sprinkle it, but the urine of a girl must be washed. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Sprinkling means putting water on it without rubbing or squeezing, until it covers the entire area. 
If it is said, What is the reason why the urine of a boy who is not eating food is sprinkled and not washed like the urine of a girl? The answer is that the reason is that this is what is enjoined in the Sunnah, and that is sufficient reason. Hence when ‘Aa’ishah was asked why a woman has to make up fasts that were missed because of menstruation but she does not have to make up prayers missed for the same reason, she said, “That used to happen to us at the time of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and we were commanded to make up the fasts and we were not commanded to make up the prayers.”

With regard to the age of the boy whose urine may be cleaned by sprinkling, we have quoted above the words of Qataadah: This applies so long as they are not eating food; if they are eating food then it must be washed in both cases. What is meant by this is when the child wants food, is nourished by it and asks for it, is does not refer to when he eats whatever is placed in his mouth.

36881,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36881,The obligation to make the rows straight in prayer and the meaning thereof,Is straightening the rows in congregational prayers obligatory in the sense that the worshippers are sinning if they do not make their rows straight?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Islam pays a great deal of attention to the rows of worshippers, as it has enjoined straightening the rows and speaks clearly of the virtue and importance of straightening them. 
It was narrated from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Straighten your rows, for straightening the rows is part of perfecting prayer.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 690; Muslim, 433. According to another report narrated by al-Bukhari (723): “Straighten your rows, for straightening the rows is part of establishing prayer.” 
It was narrated that Abu Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to touch our shoulders when we were praying and he would say: “Make the rows straight and do not differ, lest your hearts differ.” Narrated by Muslim, 432. 
It was narrated that al-Nu’maan ibn Basheer (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to straighten our rows, as if he was straightening the shaft of an arrow, until he saw that we had learned it. Then he came out one day and was about to say the takbeer, when he noticed a man whose chest was sticking out from the row. He said: “Slaves of Allah! Make your rows straight or Allah will cause discord among you.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 717; Muslim, 436.  
Al-Nawawi said in Sharh Muslim: 
With regard to the phrase “[he] used to straighten our rows, as if he was straightening the shaft of an arrow”, the qadaah is the wooden shaft of the arrow where it is pared and trimmed, i.e., he paid such great attention to straightening the rows, as if he was straightening the shaft of an arrow, because they were so straight. End quote. 
These texts clearly show that it is obligatory to straighten the rows. Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Saheeh: “Chapter: The sin of those who do not complete the rows”, in which he narrated with his isnaad from Bushayr ibn Yasaar al-Ansaari from Anas ibn Malik that he came to Madeenah and it was said to him: What do you find has changed in us since the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? He said: I do not find anything except that you do not straighten your rows. Narrated by al-Bukhari, 724. 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Baari: This is to be understood as meaning that al-Bukhari understood it to be obligatory from the form of command in the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Straighten your rows,” and from the general meaning of his words, “Pray as you have seen me praying,” and from the warning issued against failing to do that. So in his view, on the basis of this evidence,  Anas was criticizing a failure to do something that is obligatory, although a criticism may also come for failing to do something that is Sunnah. Although straightening the rows is obligatory, the prayer of those who fail to do that and do not straighten their rows is still valid. That is supported by the fact that although Anas criticized them, he did not tell them to repeat their prayer. End quote. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
The words “or Allah will cause discord among you” … this is undoubtedly a warning to those who fail to straighten their rows. Hence some of the scholars are of the view that it is obligatory to make the rows straight. They quoted as evidence for that the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined it and warned those who went against his command. If something is enjoined and a warning issued against doing the opposite, it cannot be said that it is “only Sunnah”. 
Hence the correct view on this matter is that it is obligatory to straighten the rows, and if the congregation does not straighten the rows, then they are sinning. This is the apparent meaning of the words of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah.""(Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 3/6)
Straightening the rows is obligatory so that no one will stand in front of anyone else, whether that is by his chest or his foot sticking out. 
It says in ‘Awn al-Ma’bood: 
What is meant by straightening the rows is for the people standing in the row to make a straight line. End quote. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
Straightening the rows means that no one stands in front of anyone else, but is what is meant that the foot should not be in front of anyone else’s foot? The answer is that what is meant is the shoulders at the top of the body, and the heels at the bottom of the body. 
Attention is paid to the heels because they are the foundation on which the body rests. The heel is at the bottom of the leg, and the leg is the pillar of the body, so this is what matters. As for the toes, they do not count, because toes vary; some people have long feet and some have short feet, so what matters is the heel. 
There is another kind of straightening that means completeness or perfection, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And when he attained his full strength, and was perfect (in manhood)” [Al-Qasas 28:14]
Here the word astawa (translated as ‘was perfect’) means: was made complete. If we say istiwa’ al-sufoof (straightening of the rows) in the sense of completeness, that does not detract from the meaning of straightening them in the sense of ensuring that everyone stands parallel, rather it encompasses a number of meanings: 
1 – Straightness in the sense of standing parallel, which according to the correct view is obligatory, as stated above. 
2 – Making the rows compact, which is part of making them complete or perfect. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to enjoin that, and he urged his ummah to form rows as the angels do before their Lord, filling in and completing the rows one by one. But what is meant by making the rows compact is not leaving gaps for the devils; it does not mean crowding and cramming people in, because there is a difference between making it compact and making it crowded. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say: “Make the rows straight, and make the shoulders parallel… and do not leave gaps for the devils.” 
i.e., there should be no gaps between you through which the devils can enter, because the devils enter among the rows like small lambs so that they can spoil the prayer of the worshippers. 
3 – Completing the first row and then the next. This is part of straightening the rows. The second row should not be begun until the first row is completed, and the third row should not be begun until the second row is completed, and so on. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) urged completing the first row and said: “If the people knew what there is in the call and the first row, but they had no way other than drawing lots, then they would draw lots.” I.e., if two people came to the first row and one of them said, “I am more entitled to it than you,” and the other said, “I am more entitled,” and he said: “Let us draw lots to see which of us will be in this spot.” 
One of the ways in which the Shaytaan plays with people nowadays is when they see that the first row is only half full, but despite that they start the second row, then when the iqaamah is given, and it is said to them,  “Complete the first row,” they start looking around in confusion. 
4 – Another aspect of straightening the rows is making the rows close to one another and close to the imam, because they are a jamaa’ah (congregation, group) and the word jamaa’ah is taken from the word ijtimaa’ (coming together). There can be no proper coming together if the rows are far apart. The closer the rows are to one another and to the imam, the better it is. In some mosques we see gaps between the imam and the first row that are so wide that another row or two could fit in, because the imam goes so far forward. I think that this stems from ignorance. The Sunnah is for the imam to be close to the people who are praying behind him, and the people should be close to the imam, and each row should be close to the other. The definition of close is that there should be enough room between them to prostrate and a little more. 
5 – Another aspect of straightening the rows is to draw close to the imam, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Let those among you who are men of wisdom and understanding be closest to me.” The closer the better. Hence it is encouraged to draw close to the imam in Jumu’ah prayers, because drawing close to the imam in Jumu’ah prayers is achieved by drawing close to him during the prayer and during the khutbah. Drawing close to the imam is something desirable, but some people are negligent concerning that and are not keen to do it. 
6 – Another aspect of straightening the rows is preferring the right hand side of the row to the left, i.e., the right side of the row is better than the left, but that is not in absolute terms, as in the case of the first row, because if it was in absolute terms, as in the case of the first row, the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have said, “Complete the right side then the right side,” as he said, “Complete the first row then the next.” The right side is better than the left if both right and left are roughly equal, such as if there are five on the right and five on the left, then the eleventh man comes. In that case we tell him: Go to the right, because the right is better when both sides are equal or almost equal, such that the difference between the right and left is not obvious. But if there is a difference, then undoubtedly the left side of a closer row is better than the right side of a more distant row. This is indicated by the fact that if the congregation is just three people, the imam should stand between them, i.e., between the other two. This indicates that the right is not better in absolute terms, because if it were better in absolute terms, it would be better for the two people to stand on the right of the imam, but what is prescribed is that one should be on the right and one on the left so that the imam is in the middle and there is no imbalance on one side. 
7 – Another aspect of straightening the rows is that the women should stand on their own, i.e., the women should be behind the men, not mixed with the men, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best rows for men are the first rows and the worst are the last, and the best rows for women are the last rows and the worst are the first.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated that the further women are behind the men, the better. 
So it is better for women to be far behind the men, because of the fitnah involved in their being close to men. Worse than that is their mixing with the men, where a woman would be beside a man or a row of women would be between two rows of men.

36883,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36883,Mistakes made on the way to Muzdalifah and in Muzdalifah,What are the mistakes that you advise us to avoid on the way to Muzdalifah?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The mistakes that are made on the way from ‘Arafah to Muzdalifah include the following: 
1-  When they leave ‘Arafah for Muzdalifah some people push and shove others, and they are in too much of a hurry which sometimes leads to trafiic accidents. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) left ‘Arafah in a calm and dignified manner. He pulled the reins of his she-camel al-Qaswa’ tight so that her head touched the saddle (in order to keep her under perfect control), and he gestured to the people with his hand to slow down. But when he found an empty space ahead of him, he would hasten, and whenever he happened to pass over an elevated tract of sand, he slightly loosened (the camel’s reins) till she climbed up. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) paid attention to what was going on in this journey, but if it is the matter of a choice between going quickly and taking one's time, then taking one's time is preferable.  
2-  Some people stop before they reach Muzdalifah, especially those who are walking, because they get tired, and they stay there until they pray Fajr, then they go to Mina. Whoever does that has failed to stay overnight in Muzdalifah, and this is a very serious matter, because staying overnight in Muzdalifah is one of the essential parts of Hajj according to some scholars, and one of the obligatory duties of Hajj according to the majority, and Sunnah according to others. The correct view is that it is one of the obligatory duties of Hajj, and the pilgrim must stay overnight in Muzdalifah, and not leave until the time when it is permissible for him to leave, as we shall see below in sha Allah. 
3- Some people pray Maghrib and ‘Isha’ on the way in the usual manner, before they reach Muzdalifah. This is contrary to the Sunnah, because when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stopped on the way and urinated and made wudoo’, Usaamah ibn Zayd said to him, “Are you going to pray, O Messenger of Allah?” He said, “The prayer is still ahead of you.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1669; Muslim, 1280. And he did not pray until he reached Muzdalifah. He entered it after the time for ‘Isha’ prayer had begun and he prayed Maghrib and ‘Isha’ there, joined at the time of ‘Isha’. 
4- Some people do not pray Maghrib and ‘Isha’ until they reach Muzdalifah, even if the time for ‘Isha’ has ended. This is not permissible; it is haraam and is a major sin, because delaying prayers until the time for them is over is haraam according to the evidence of the Quran and Sunnah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, As‑Salaah (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours” [Al-Nisa’ 4:103]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained and defined these times, and Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whosoever transgresses the set limits of Allah, then indeed he has wronged himself” [Al-Talaaq 65:1] 
“And whoever transgresses the limits ordained by Allah, then such are the Zaalimoon (wrongdoers)” [Al-Baqarah 2:229]
If a person fears that the time for ‘Isha’ may end before he reaches Muzdalifah, then he has to pray even if he has not yet reached Muzdalifah. He should pray according to his situation: if he is walking, then he should stop and pray, standing, bowing and prostrating. If he is riding and cannot get down then he should pray in his vehicle, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can” [Al-Taghaabun 64:16]
But it is unlikely that he will not be able to get out of his vehicle in this case, because everyone could get out and stand at the side of the road, to the right or the left, and pray.  
Whatever the case, it is not permissible for anyone to delay Maghrib and ‘Isha’ prayer until the time for ‘Isha’ is over on the grounds that he wants to follow the Sunnah and not pray until he reaches Muzdalifah, because this delay is contrary to the Sunnah, and the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) delayed it, but he still prayed it within the proper time. 
5-  Some pilgrims pray Fajr before its time, praying and leaving. This is a serious mistake, because prayer offered before its time is not accepted, rather it is haraam because it is overstepping the limits set by Allah. Prayers are to offered at set times, the beginning and end of which are defined in sharee’ah, so it is not permissible for anyone to offer a prayer before its time begins. 
The pilgrim has to pay attention to this matter, and not pray Fajr until after he is certain or thinks it most likely that the time for Fajr has begun. It is true that he should hasten to pray Fajr in Muzdalifah, because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did that, but that does not mean that he should pray it before its time begins. The pilgrim should beware of doing that. 
6- Some pilgrims leave Muzdalifah before they have spent the minimum period of time there, so you see them passing through and not stopping, and saying that just passing through is sufficient. This is a serious mistake, because passing through is not sufficient, rather the Sunnah indicates that the pilgrim should stay in Muzdalifah until he prays Fajr, then he should stop at al-Mash’ar al-Haraam, making du’aa’ to Allah until it has become very light, then he should set out for Mina. (What is meant by it becoming very light is when the daylight has spread before the sun actually rises). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) granted a concession to the weak among his family, allowing them to leave Muzdalifah at night. Asma’ bint Abi Bakr used to watch for the setting of the moon, and when the moon disappeared she left Muzdalifah and went to Mina. 
This – leaving after the moon has set – should be the criterion, because it was the action of one of the Sahaaabah, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave permission to the weak among his family to leave at night; in this hadeeth he did not give a definition of night, but the actions of the Sahaabi explain that. So the factor that should determine when the weak and others for whom the crowding is difficult should leave Muzdalifah is when the moon sets on the night of the tenth of Dhu’l-Hijjah, which is definitely after midnight, when approximately two-thirds of the night have passed.  
7- Some people stay up on the night of Muzdalifah praying qiyaam, reading Quran and reciting dhikr. This is contrary to the Sunnah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not worship Allah in this manner on this night, rather in Saheeh Muslim it is narrated from the hadeeth of Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him) that after the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had prayed ‘Isha’, he lay down until dawn came, then he prayed Fajr. This indicates that there is no tahajjud or worship or tasbeeh or dhikr or reading Quran on this night. 
8- Some pilgrims stay in Muzdalifah until the sun has risen, and they pray Salaat al-Shurooq or al-Ishraaq, then they leave after that. This is a mistake because it involves going against the teaching of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and is in accordance with the ways of the mushrikeen. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) left Muzdalifah before the sun rose, when it had become very light, but the mushrikoon used to wait until the sun rose. 
Whoever stays in Muzdalifah worshipping Allah until the sun rises is imitating the mushrikeen and is going against the Sunnah of the greatest of the Messengers (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).",Reference: Daleel al-Akhta’ allati yaqa’a fiha al-Haaj wa’l-Mu’tamir (mistakes made by pilgrims performing Hajj and ‘Umrah)

    by trying to divert your brother from marrying her, such as by sending him a letter or telling him directly that marrying this girl will do him no 
    good. If that does not put him off marrying her, then you should tell him that you know something that means that he has to forget about marrying

36889,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36889,Does Sleeping Break Wudu?,What is the evidence that sleep invalidates wudu?,"If the sleep is light and the sleeper can feel it if he breaks his wudu, then sleeping does not break wudu whether the sleeper is lying down, sitting, leaning on something or sitting without leaning.","Evidence that sleeping breaks Wudu


Does sleeping break Wudu?


The difference between deep sleep and light sleep","Praise be to Allah.Evidence that sleeping breaks Wudu
With regard to the evidence that sleep invalidates wudu, that is proven by the hadith of Safwan ibn ‘Assal (may Allah be pleased with him) in al-Sunan. He said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to command us, if we were travelling, not to take off our khufuf for three days and nights, except in the case of janabah, but not in the case of stools, urine or sleep. (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 89; classed as hasan by al-Albani. So he mentioned sleep as one of the things that invalidate wudu.)
Does sleeping break Wudu?
The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differed as to whether sleep invalidates wudu or not, and there are several points of view, including the following: 

That all kinds of sleep invalidate wudu, whether it is a little or a lot, no matter in what position one sleeps. This is the view of Ishaq, al-Muzani, al-Hasan al-Basri and Ibn al-Mundhir, because of the hadith of Safwan ibn ‘Assal (may Allah be pleased with him) quoted above, where he mentioned sleep as one of the things that invalidate wudu, and did not define it any further. 
That sleep does not invalidate wudu in all cases, because of the hadith of Anas ibn Malik, according to which the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) used to wait for ‘Isha at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) until their heads drooped, then they prayed and they did not do wudu. (Narrated by Muslim, 376) According to the report of al-Bazzar: they would lie on their sides. 

This is the view of Abu Musa al-Ash’ari (may Allah be pleased with him) and Sa’id ibn al-Musayyib. 
These two views are opposite, and each of them is based on a part of the evidence. However, the majority of scholars reconciled this evidence and said that sleep invalidates wudu in certain circumstances and not in others, although they differed in the way in which they reconciled between the evidence. 

If a person sleeps sitting with his backside firmly on the ground, it does not invalidate wudu, and if his backside is not firmly on the ground, it does invalidate wudu, regardless of what position he is in. This is the view of the Hanafis and Shafi’is. Al-Majmu’, 2/14 
Sleep invalidates wudu except light sleep in the case of one who is sitting or standing. This is the view of the Hanbalis. See al-Insaf, 2/20, 25 

The reason why an exception is made in the case of light sleep of one who is sitting or standing is that in this case the place where wind is emitted will be joined together and in this case one may think it most likely that he has not broken his wudu. 
    3. Some of them said: a great deal of sleep invalidates wudu whatever the case, unlike a little sleep. This is the view of Malik and was narrated in one report from Ahmad. 
The difference between deep sleep and light sleep
The difference between a great deal of sleep and a little is that a great deal of sleep is deep sleep in which a person does not feel that he has broken his wudu if that takes place. A little sleep is that in which a person does feel that he has broken his wudu if that takes place, such as passing wind. 
This view is the one favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), and among our contemporary scholars it was the view favoured by Shaykh Ibn Baz, Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin and the scholars of the Standing Committee, and it is the correct view. This view reconciles all the evidence, for the hadith of Safwan ibn ‘Assal indicates that sleep invalidates wudu and the hadith of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) indicates that it does not do so. 
The hadith of Anas is to be interpreted as referring to light sleep in which a person can feel that he has broken his wudu if that takes place, and the hadith of Safwan is to be interpreted as referring to deep sleep in which a person does not feel if he breaks his wudu. 
This is supported by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “The eye is the string that ties the anal sphincter; when the eyes sleep, the string is loosened.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 4/97; classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 4148) 
What this means is that wakefulness is the string that ties the anal sphincter, i.e. it keeps what is inside from coming out, because so long as a person is awake he can feel what comes out, but when he sleeps the string is loosened. 
Al-Tibi said: “When a person is awake, he keeps control of what is in his stomach but when he sleeps he loses that control and his muscles relax.” (‘Awn al-Ma’bud) 
If a person cannot control his sphincter in the sense that if he breaks his wudu he cannot feel it, then his sleep invalidates wudu, otherwise it does not.  (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 1/275) 
Al-San'ani said in Subul al-Salam (1/97): 
“The most likely to be correct is the view that sleep invalidates wudu, because of the hadith of Safwan… but the word nawm (sleep) in his hadith is general in meaning, and there is the hadith of Anas which speaks of the sleep of the Sahabah and says that they did not do wudu even if they snored, and that they used to lie on their sides, and that they would be woken up. The basic principle is that they are people of integrity and that they were not unaware of what invalidates wudu, especially since Anas narrated this from the Sahabah in general, and it is well known that among them were knowledgeable men who had deep knowledge of the religion, especially the prayer which is the greatest pillar of Islam, and especially those among them who used to wait to pray with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). They were the elite of the Sahabah, and as that is the case, the general wording of the hadith of Safwan is to be taken as referring to deep sleep only, in which a person is no longer aware, and what Anas said about snoring, lying on their sides and being woken up is to be understood as referring to sleep that was not deep, because a person may snore at the beginning of sleep, before sleep has become deep, and lying one one’s side does not necessarily mean that one is sleeping deeply.”
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmu’ al-Fatawa, when listing the things that invalidate wudu: 
“A great deal of sleep means if it is such that the sleeper does not feel it if he breaks his wudu. But if the sleep is light and the sleeper can feel it if he breaks his wudu, then sleep does not invalidate wudu. It makes no difference if the sleeper is lying down, sitting, leaning on something or sitting without leaning. What matters is the level of awareness. If it is such that he will feel it if he breaks his wudu, then his wudu is not invalidated by sleep. If he is in a state where he would not feel it if he breaks his wudu, then he must do wudu, because sleep itself does not invalidate wudu, rather there is the probability that one has broken one's wudu when sleeping. But if one is still aware and can be certain that he has not broken his wudu because he can feel it if it happens, then sleep does not invalidate his wudu. The evidence that sleep itself does not invalidate wudu is the fact that light sleep does not invalidate wudu. If sleep did invalidate wudu then a little or a lot of it would do so, just as a little or a lot of urine invalidates wudu.”
Similarly in Fatawa Ibn Baz (10/144) it says: 
“Sleep invalidates wudu if it is so deep that one is no longer aware, because the great Sahabi Safwan ibn ‘Assal al-Muradi (may Allah be pleased with him) said:  The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to command us, if we were travelling, not to take off our khufuf for three days and nights, except in the case of janabah, but not in the case of stools, urine or sleep. Narrated by al-Nasai and al-Tirmidhi; classed as sahih by Ibn Khuzaymah. 
And Mu’awiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The eye is the string that ties the anal sphincter; when the eyes sleep, the string is loosened.” (Narrated by Ahmad and al-Tabarani. Its isnad contains some weakness, but there are corroborating reports that support it, such as the hadith of Safwan mentioned above, thus it is counted as a hasan hadith.) 
As for feeling drowsy, this does not invalidate wudu because it does not cause loss of awareness. Thus the ahadith that have been narrated on this topic can be reconciled.”
The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 
“Deep sleep may lead to breaking of wudu, so whoever sleeps deeply in the mosque or elsewhere has to repeat his wudu, whether he was standing, sitting or lying down, and whether he has a masbahah in his hand or not. But if the sleep is not deep, such as dozing off, in which one does not lose awareness, he does not have to repeat his wudu, because of the sahih ahadith which have been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning that, as mentioned above.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 5/262)
And they also said: 
“Light sleep in which one does not lose consciousness does not invalidate wudu. It was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to delay ‘Isha prayer on some occasions, until the heads of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would droop, then they would pray and would not do wud.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 5/263)

I want to know, how should men be dressed in any country or environment whether in an Islamic country or in a non-Islamic country?","Some of the guidelines of the Islamic dress code for men include: 
1- It is not permissible to wear thin or see-through clothing;
2- It is haram to imitate the polytheists and unbelievers in their manner of dress;
3- It is haram for women to imitate men and men to imitate women in the way they dress.",,"Praise be to Allah.There follows a summary of the rulings on dress for men. We ask Allah to make it sufficient and beneficial. 

The basic principle concerning everything that is worn is that it is halal and permissible, except for that concerning which there is a text to state that it is haram, such as silk for males. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “These two [gold and silk] are forbidden for the males of my ummah and permissible for the females.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 3640; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah)

Similarly it is not permissible to wear the skin of a dead animal (one that has died of natural causes) unless it has been tanned.
With regard to wearing clothes made of wool, goat hair and camel hair, these are pure and permissible. For more information on the use of the skin of dead animals after tanning, please see these answers:  no. 1695  and 9022 .

It is not permissible to wear thin or see-through clothing that does not conceal the ‘awrah.
It is haram to imitate the polytheists and unbelievers in their manner of dress , so it is not permissible to wear clothing that is unique to the unbelievers.

‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw ‘Ali wearing two garments dyed with safflower and said: “These are garments of the unbelievers; do not wear them.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2077)

It is haram for women to imitate men and men to imitate women in the way they dress. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the men who imitate women and the women who imitate men.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5546)
It is Sunnah for a Muslim to start with the right when dressing, and to say, Bismillah (In the name of Allah), and to start with the left when taking clothes off.

Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When you get dressed and when you do wudu, start on the right.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4141; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 787) 

It is Sunnah for the one who is putting on a new garment to thank Allah and make du`a.

Abu Sa’id said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) put on a new garment, he would call it by its name, whether it was a turban, a shirt or a cloak, then he would say: “Allahumma laka al-hamd anta kasawtanihi asaluka khayrahu wa khayra ma suni’a lah wa a’udhu bika min sharrihi wa sharri ma suni’a lah (O Allah, to You be all praise. You have clothed me with it. I ask You for the good of it and the good for which it was made, and I seek refuge with You from the evil of it and the evil for which it was made).” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1767; Abu Dawud, 4020; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 4664)

It is Sunnah to pay attention to keeping one's clothes clean, without feeling arrogant or exaggerating about that.

‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one will enter Paradise in whose heart is a mustard-seed of arrogance.” A man said: “What if a man likes his clothes to look nice and his shoes to look nice?” He said: “Allah is Beautiful and loves beauty; arrogance means rejecting the truth and looking down on people.” (Narrated by Muslim, 91)

It is mustahabb to wear white clothes

Ibn 'Abbas said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Wear white clothes, for they are the best of your clothes, and shroud your dead in them.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 994, hasan sahih. This is what the scholars regarded as mustahabb. Also narrated by Abu Dawud, 4061; Ibn Majah, 1472. )

It is haram for the Muslim man to let any garment he wears hang down beneath his ankles (an action known as isbal ); the limit for any garment is the ankles.

Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said; “Whatever of the lower garment is beneath the ankles is in the Fire.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5450) 
Abu Dharr narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three to whom Allah will not speak on the Day of Resurrection and will not look at them or praise them, and theirs will be a painful torment.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) repeated it three times. Abu Dharr said: “May they be doomed and lost; who are they, O Messenger of Allah?” He said: “The one who lets his garment hang beneath his ankles, the one who reminds others of favours he has done, and the one who sells his product by means of false oaths.” (Narrated by Muslim, 106)

It is haram to wear garments of fame and vanity, which means a garment that stands out from others so that people will look at the wearer and he will become known for it.

Ibn ‘Umar said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever wears a garment of fame and vanity, Allah will dress him in a garment like it on the Day of Resurrection.” 
According to another version, “…then set it ablaze.” And according to a third version, “will dress him in a garment of humiliation.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4029; Ibn Majah, 3606 and 3607; classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih al-Targhib, 2089)

36896,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36896,Description of the fear prayer,What is the description of the fear prayer?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    The fear prayer is prescribed in the verse in which Allaah 
    says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“When you (O Messenger 
    Muhammad) are among them, and lead them in As‑Salaah (the prayer), let one 
    party of them stand up [in Salaah (prayer)] with you taking their arms with 
    them; when they finish their prostrations, let them take their positions in 
    the rear and let the other party come up which have not yet prayed, and let 
    them pray with you taking all the precautions and bearing arms. Those who 
    disbelieve wish, if you were negligent of your arms and your baggage, to 
    attack you in a single rush, but there is no sin on you if you put away your 
    arms because of the inconvenience of rain or because you are ill, but take 
    every precaution for yourselves. Verily, Allaah has prepared a humiliating 
    torment for the disbelievers”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:102]
The Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) led his companions in offering this 
    prayer on a number of occasions, in different ways. 

    Imam Ahmad said: There are six or seven proven ahaadeeth 
    concerning the fear prayer; whichever of them a person does, it is 
    permissible. 

    Ibn al-Qayyim said: 

    There are six basic ways, but some scholars said there were 
    more, because every time they saw a different report by the narrators, they 
    counted that as another way in which the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) did it, whereas these are variations in the reports 
    of the narrators. End quote. Al-Haafiz said: This is the correct view. 

    The way in which the fear prayer is done differs according to 
    the severity of the fear and the location of the enemy – whether they are in 
    the direction of the qiblah or some other direction. 

    The leader or imam should choose the version that is most 
    suited to the situation and is most likely to serve the purpose, which is to 
    ensure that the prayer is performed whilst guarding against the enemy, so 
    that they will not attack the Muslims and catch them unawares whilst they 
    are praying. 

    Al-Khattaabi said: There are different types of the fear 
    prayer which the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    offered on different occasions and in different ways, and the way in which 
    it is to be done is to choose the best way that will ensure that the prayer 
    is performed with the utmost vigilance.

     Secondly: when it was first prescribed 

    It was narrated that Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) 
    said: We went out with the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) to fight some people from Juhaynah, and they fought us 
    fiercely. When we prayed Zuhr, the mushrikeen said: If we had attacked them 
    then, we would have finished them off. Jibreel informed the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about that, and the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us 
    about it. He said: They said: There will come to them a prayer that is 
    dearer to them than their children. When the time for ‘Asr came, we formed 
    two rows, and the mushrikeen were between us and the qiblah … Then he stated 
    that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) led them in offering the fear prayer. Narrated by Muslim, 840 

    Thirdly: 
Here it will be 
    sufficient for us to describe some of the ways in which it is offered. 

    1 – If the enemy is in a direction other than the qiblah: the 
    leader should divide the army into two groups, one which will pray with him 
    and another which will face the enemy lest they attack the Muslims. He 
    should lead the first group in praying one rak’ah, then when he stands up 
    for the second rak'ah they should complete the prayer by themselves, i.e., 
    they should intend to pray alone and complete the prayer by themselves, 
    whilst the imam remains standing. Then when they have completed the prayer 
    by themselves, they should go and stand where the second group was, facing 
    the enemy, and the second group should come and join the imam in the second 
    rak’ah. In this case the imam should make the second rak’ah longer than the 
    first, so that the second group may catch up with him. So the second group 
    should join the imam and he should lead them in the remaining rak’ah, then 
    he should sit to recite the tashahhud. When he sits to recite the tashahhud, 
    this group should get up immediately after prostrating and complete the 
    remaining rak’ah, then catch up with the imam for the tashahhud, after which 
    he should lead them in saying the salaam. This version is in accordance with 
    the apparent meaning of the Qur’aan, as Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“When you (O Messenger 
    Muhammad) are among them, and lead them in As‑Salaah (the prayer), let one 
    party of them stand up [in Salaah (prayer)] with you taking their arms with 
    them; when they finish their prostrations, let them take their positions in 
    the rear and let the other party come up which have not yet prayed, and let 
    them pray with you taking all the precautions and bearing arms.”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:102] 

     al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/298 

    al-Bukhaari (413) and Muslim (842) narrated from Maalik, from 
    Yazeed ibn Rumaan, from Saalih ibn Khawwaat from one who saw the Messenger 
    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on the day of 
    Dhaat al-Riqaa’ when he offered the fear prayer, that one group formed rows 
    with him, and another group faced the enemy. He led those who were with him 
    in praying one rak’ah, then he remained standing and they completed the 
    prayer by themselves. Then they moved away and faced the enemy, and the 
    other group came. He led them in praying the remaining rak’ah, then he 
    remained sitting and they completed the prayer by themselves, then he said 
    the tasleem with them. 
Maalik said: This is 
    best that I have heard concerning the fear prayer. 

    2 – If the enemy is in the direction of the qiblah, then the 
    imam should form them into two rows and start leading all of them in prayer, 
    bowing with all of them and standing up with all of them, then when he 
    prostrates the first row only should prostrate with him and the second row 
    should remain standing, keeping guard. When he stands up, the first row 
    should stand with him and the back row should prostrate. Then when they 
    stand up, the back row should move forward and the front row should move 
    backward, then he should lead them all in the second rak’ah, standing and 
    bowing with all of them, then when he prostrates the row which moved 
    forward, which was in the back during the first rak'ah, should prostrate 
    with him, then when he sits to recite the tashahhud the back row should 
    prostrate. When they sit to recite the tashahhud the imam should say the 
    tasleem with all of them.  This can only be done when the enemy is in the 
    direction of the qiblah. 

    Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/300 

    Muslim (840) narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah 
    be pleased with him) said:  I was present during the fear prayer with the 
    Messenger of Allaah (S). We formed two rows, one row behind the Messenger of 
    Allaah (S), and the enemy was between us and the qiblah. The Messenger of 
    Allaah (S) said takbeer and we all said takbeer. Then he bowed and we all 
    bowed. Then he raised his head from bowing and we all raised our heads. Then 
    he and the row that was directly behind him went down in prostration, and 
    the back row remained standing, facing the enemy. When the Prophet (S) had 
    finished prostrating, the row that was directly behind him stood up, and the 
    back row went down in prostration and then stood up. Then the back row went 
    forward and the front row moved back. Then the Prophet (S) bowed and we all 
    bowed, then he raised his head from bowing and we all raised our heads. Then 
    he and the row that was directly behind him, that had been in the back 
    during the first rak’ah, went down in prostration, and the back row remained 
    standing, facing the enemy.  When the Prophet and the row that was directly 
    behind him had finished prostrating, the back row went down in prostration. 
    Then the Prophet (S) said the tasleem and we all did likewise 
3 – If the fear is 
    intense, and the imam cannot form the Muslims into rows and lead them in 
    prayer in congregation. This is when the two sides are in the thick of 
    battle and the fighting is intense. 

    In this case, each Muslim should pray by himself, as he is 
    fighting, whether he is walking on foot, or riding, facing the qiblah or 
    not. He should gesture for bowing and prostrating, making the prostration 
    lower than the bowing. 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And if you fear (an enemy), perform Salaah (pray) on foot 
    or riding”

    [al-Baqarah 2:239]

    al-Sa’di said (p. 109): 

    “on foot” means walking. “riding” means on horseback or 
    camelback or any other kind of mount. In this case it is not necessary to 
    face towards the qiblah. This prayer is exempt because of fear. End quote. 

    Al-Bukhaari (943) narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “If they are more than that, then let them pray standing and 
    riding.” 

    Al-Haafiz said: 

    “If they are more than that” refers to the enemy. What is 
    meant is that if fear is intense and the enemy is great in number and there 
    is the fear of dividing the Muslims, then in that case it is permissible to 
    pray however one can, and it is permissible to omit the pillars or essential 
    parts of the prayer that one cannot do. So he should move from standing to 
    bowing, and from bowing to prostrating, by means of gestures etc. This is 
    the view of the majority. End quote. 

    Al-Tabari narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: When fighting breaks 
    out, then (the prayer) is just dhikr and gesturing with the head. 

    Al-Bukhaari (4535) narrated from Naafi’ that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn 
    ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) described the fear prayer, then he 
    said: 

    If the fear was more intense than that, then they prayed on 
    foot, standing on their feet, or riding, facing the qiblah or not facing the 
    qiblah. Naafi’ said: I do not think that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar narrated that 
    except from the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him). 

     Al-Haafiz said: 
 The point is that there 
    is a difference of opinion concerning the words, “if the fear was more 
    intense than that” – is this attributable to the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) or is it the word of Ibn ‘Umar? The correct 
    view is that it is attributable to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him). End quote. 

    It says in al-Muntaqa Sharh al-Muwatta’: 

    “If the fear was more intense than that” means: a case of 
    fear in which it is not possible to stand in one spot or to form rows. So 
    they prayed on foot. That is because fear is of two types: one of which is 
    when it is possible to stand still and form rows, but there is the fear that 
    the enemy may attack whilst the Muslims are busy with the prayer. 

    The second type of fear is that in which it is not possible 
    to stand in one spot or form rows, such as when under attack by the enemy. 
    In this case each person should pray as best he can, on foot or riding. 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And if you fear (an enemy), perform Salaah (pray) on foot 
    or riding”

    [al-Baqarah 2:239]

    Fourthly: 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ 
    (4/300): 
But if someone were to 
    say: What if we assume that the ways narrated from the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cannot be applied nowadays, because the 
    methods of warfare have changed? 

    We say: If it is necessary to pray at a time of fear of the 
    enemy, they should pray in the manner that is closest to the ways narrated 
    from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), if the 
    ways that are narrated from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) cannot be followed, because Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you 
    can”

    [al-Taghaabun 64:16]

36897,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36897,Is it permissible for the muhrim to comb his hair?,Is it permissible for the muhrim to comb his hair?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:  
The muhrim should not comb his hair, because what the pilgrim should do is to look dusty and unkempt. There is nothing wrong with him washing his hair, but combing may cause hair to fall out. But if some of the muhrim’s hair falls out without him intending that, because of his scratching or rubbing his head and the like, then there is no sin on him in this case, because he did not deliberately intend to remove those hairs. It should be noted that with regard to all the things that are forbidden in ihraam, if a person does not intend to do them deliberately but he happens to do them by mistake or out of forgetfulness, there is no sin on him in this case, because Allaah says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning):
“And there is no sin on you concerning that in which you made a mistake, except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend. And Allaah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Ahzaab 33:5]
