5201,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5201,The difference between sponsoring orphans and adopting them,"Many refugees are entering the USA from Kosova, they may be sponsored by christain organizations. Some brothers want to sponsor the orphans by allowing them to live in their homes and feeding them. A scholar here said that it is Haraam to adopt someone in Islaam, and he discouraged the people from sponsoring the orphans. My question is, doesn't Islaam allow us to adopt the orphans, only that the orphan does not change his last name, nor is he considered the child of the one adopting him.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is a difference between adoption and sponsoring orphans. 
A – Adoption means that a man takes an orphan and makes him like one of his own children, calling him after him, so that the orphan is not allowed to marry one of the man’s daughters, and so the sons of the adoptive father are regarded as brothers of the orphan and his daughters are regarded as his sisters, and his (the father’s) sisters are regarded as his paternal aunts, and so on. This was one of the things that were done during the first Jaahiliyyah, and some of the Sahaabah carried the names of their adoptive fathers, as in the case of al-Miqdaad ibn al-Aswad whose real father’s name was ‘Amr, but he was called ibn (son of) al-Aswad, after the man who had adopted him.
This continued into the early days of Islam, until Allaah forbade that, according to a well-known story. Zayd ibn Haarithah was called Zayd ibn Muhammad, and he was the husband of Zaynab bint Jahsh, then Zayd divorced her. 
It was narrated that Anas said: When Zaynab’s ‘iddah came to an end, the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Zayd ibn Haarithah, “Go and tell her about me (that I want to marry her).” So he went to her and found her kneading dough. He said, “O Zaynab, good news. The Messenger of Allaah wants to marry you.” She said, “I will not do anything until I consult with my Lord.” Then she got up and went to her prayer-place, then the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came and entered upon her.
 Concerning this, Allaah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) when you said to him (Zayd bin Haarithah the freed‑slave of the Prophet) on whom Allaah has bestowed grace (by guiding him to Islam) and you (O Muhammad too) have done favour (by manumitting him): ‘Keep your wife to yourself, and fear Allaah.’ But you did hide in yourself (i.e. what Allaah has already made known to you that Hewill give her to you in marriage) that which Allaah will make manifest, you did fear the people (i.e., their saying that Muhammad married the divorced wife of his manumitted slave) whereas Allaah had a better right that you should fear Him. So when Zayd had accomplished his desire from her (i.e. divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage, so that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the believers in respect of (the marriage of) the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them (i.e. they have divorced them). And Allaah’s Command must be fulfilled”
[al-Ahzaab 33:37]
(Narrated by Muslim, 1428) 
B – Allaah has forbidden adoption because it causes knowledge of people’s lineage to be lost, and we have been commanded to preserve people’s lineage. 
It was narrated from Abu Dharr (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “There is no man who knowingly calls himself after someone other than his father but he has committed kufr. Whoever claims to belong to people to whom he has no ties of blood, let him take his place in Hell.” 
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3317; Muslim, 61) 
What is meant by “committed kufr” is that he has done an act of kufr, not that he is beyond the pale of Islam.
This may generate hatred and resentment between the adopted son and the children of the adoptive father, because it will cause them to lose out on something that is rightfully theirs, which will go to this orphan unlawfully who they know is not entitled to it as they are. 
Sponsoring an orphan means that a man brings the orphan to live in his house, or he sponsors him somewhere other than his house, without giving him his name or forbidding that which is permitted or permitting that which is forbidden, as is the case with adoption. Rather the one who sponsors an orphan is doing a generous deed. So there can be no comparison between one who sponsors an orphan and one who adopts a child, because of the great difference between them and because sponsoring orphans is something which is encouraged in Islam. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“…And they ask you concerning orphans. Say: The best thing is to work honestly in their property, and if you mix your affairs with theirs, then they are your brothers. And Allaah knows him who means mischief (e.g. to swallow their property) from him who means good (e.g. to save their property). And if Allaah had wished, He could have put you into difficulties. Truly, Allaah is All-Mighty, All-Wise”
[al-Baqarah 2:220]
The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that sponsoring orphans is a means of being together with him in Paradise. 
It was narrated that Sahl ibn Sa’d said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I and the one who sponsors an orphan will be like this in Paradise” – and he gestured with his index and middle fingers, holding them slightly apart. 
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4998) 
But we must point out that when these orphans reach adolescence, they must be separated from the wives and daughters of the sponsor. We should not do good with one hand and do evil with the other. We should also note that the one who is sponsored may be an orphaned girl and she may be beautiful and may become attractive before adolescence, so the sponsor must watch his sons lest they fall into doing haraam things with the orphans, because this could happen and be a means of causing mischief which it will be difficult to put right. 
We encourage our brothers to sponsor orphans, for this is something that is rarely done except by those whom Allaah has made righteous and caused them to love good and feel compassion for the orphans and the poor, especially our brothers in Kosova and Chechnya who are faced with hardship and difficulties. We ask Allaah to relieve them of their distress.

5202,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5202,Attributes    of the ideal Muslim husband,"i am a 18 yrs old girl who had been asked in marriage 5 times so far, and i have refused all of them becuase i was young ... however, now im considering marriage ... so my question is what should i look for to have a good muslim husband? and what are the most important things ...  jazak Allah khair",,,"Praise be to Allah.We appreciate your eagerness to find out the attributes which will help you to choose a righteous husband, in shaa Allah. There follows a description of the most important qualities which should be present in the man whom you choose or accept to be your husband and the father of your children, if Allah decrees that you will have children.
Religious commitment. This is the most important thing to look for in the man you want to marry. The husband should be a Muslim who adheres to all the laws and teachings of Islam in his daily life. The woman’s guardian (wali) should strive to check out this matter and not rely only on outward appearances. One of the most important things to ask about is the man’s prayer (salaah); the one who neglects the rights of Allah is more likely to neglect the rights of others. The true believer does not oppress or mistreat his wife; if he loves her, he honours her, and if he does not love her, he does not mistreat or humiliate her. It is very rare to find this attitude among those who are not sincere Muslims. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“and verily, a believing slave is better than a (free) Mushrik (idolater), even though he pleases you” [al-Baqarah 2:221]
“Verily, the most honourable of you with Allah is that (believer) who has At-Taqwaa [i.e. he is one of the Muttaqoon (the pious)]” [al-Hujuraat 49:13]
“Good statements are for good people (or good women for good men) and good people for good statements (or good men for good women)” [al-Noor 24:26]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“If there comes to you one whose religious commitment and attitude pleases you, then marry [your female relative who is under your care] to him, for if you do not do that, there will be tribulation on earth and much corruption.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 1084).
As well as being religiously committed, it is preferable that he should come from a good family and a known lineage. If two men come to propose marriage to one woman, and they are equal in terms of religious commitment, then preference should be given to the one who comes from a good family that is known for its adherence to the commands of Allah, so long as the other person is not better than him in terms of religious commitment – because the righteousness of the husband’s close relatives could be passed on to his children and his good origins and lineage may make him refrain from many foolish and cheap actions. The righteousness of the father and grandfather are beneficial to the children and grandchildren. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the town; and there was under it a treasure belonging to them; and their father was a righteous man, and your Lord intended that they should attain their age of full strength and take out their treasure as a mercy from your Lord” [al-Kahf 18:82].
See how Allah protected their father’s wealth for the two boys after the father died, as an honour to him because of his righteousness and taqwaa. By the same token, if the husband comes from a righteous family and his parents are good, Allah will make things easy for him and protect him as an honour to his parents.
It is good if he has sufficient wealth to keep him and his family from having to ask people for anything, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Faatimah bint Qays (may Allah be pleased with her), when she came to consult him about three men who had proposed marriage to her, “As for Mu’aawiyah, he is a poor man who has no wealth…” (Narrated by Muslim, 1480). It is not essential that he should be a businessman or rich, it is sufficient for him to have an income that will keep him and his family from having to ask people for anything. If there is a choice between a man who is religiously committed and a man who is wealthy, then the religious man should be given preference over the wealthy man.
It is preferable that he should be kind and gentle towards women, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Faatimah bint Qays, in the hadeeth quoted above, “As for Abu Jaham, his stick never leaves his shoulder”, referring to the fact that he used to beat women a lot.
It is good if he is sound of body and healthy, free of faults, sickness, etc., and not disabled or sterile.
It is preferable that he should have knowledge of the Qur’aan and Sunnah; if you find someone like this it is good, otherwise you should realize that this is something rare.
It is permissible for the woman to look at the man who comes to propose marriage, and for him to look at her. This should be in the presence of her mahram, and it is not permitted to look more than is necessary, or for him to see her alone, or for her to go out with him on her own, or to meet repeatedly for no reason.
According to Islam, the woman’s wali (guardian) should check on the man who proposes marriage to the woman who is under his guardianship; he should ask those whom he trusts among those who mix with him and who know him, about his commitment to Islam and his trustworthiness. He should ask them for an honest opinion and sincere, sound advice.
Before and during all of this, you must turn towards Allah and pray to Him to make it easy for you and help you to make a good choice and to grant you wisdom. Then after all these efforts, when you have decided on a particular person, you should pray Istikhaarah, asking Allah for that which is good. For more details on Salaat al-Istikhaarah, please see Question  2217. Then after you have done your utmost, put your trust in Allah, for He is the best of helpers, may He be glorified.
Adapted from Jaami’ Ahkaam al-Nisaa’ by Shaykh Mustafaa al-‘Adawi.
We ask Allah, the Exalted, the Powerful, to make things easy for you, to help you make a wise choice, and to bless you with a righteous husband and good offspring, for He is Able to do all that. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
5203,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5203,"Meaning of the word
      Taaghoot","My question is, does the term Taaghoot include objects that do not call the people to worship them, like the sun, trees, idols, stones? Also, are righteous Muslims, like Imaam Shafi', are they called Taaghoot if the people worship them or their graves?",,,"Praise be to Allah. Not
      everything that is worshipped instead of Allaah can be considered to be
      taaghoot. The most correct scholarly view concerning the meaning of the
      word Taaghoot is that of Ibn Jareer al-Tabari, who said in his Tafseer
      (3/21):
The
      correct opinion concerning Taaghoot, in my view, is that it refers to
      everyone who arrogates to himself a position that is befitting only for
      Allaah, and so is worshipped instead of Him, either by forcing others to
      worship him or by accepting their willing worship. The one that is thus
      worshipped may be a human being, or a shaytaan (devil), or an idol, or a
      statue, or some other being.
 He
      also said that the root of Taaghoot implies putting oneself in a higher
      position and overstepping the mark.
 The
      Prophets, scholars, righteous people and awliyaa’ (those who are close
      to Allaah) did not force people to worship them or obey them in such a
      thing. On the contrary, they issued the sternest warning against it. The
      purpose behind Allaah’s sending Messengers to mankind was to call them
      to believe in Allaah alone and to disbelieve in other gods besides Him.
      Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And verily, We have sent among every Ummah
      (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): ‘Worship Allaah (Alone),
      and avoid (or keep away from) Taaghoot (all false deities, etc. i.e., do
      not worship Taaghoot besides Allaah)…” [al-Nahl 16:36] 
And
      Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And
      (remember) when Allaah will say (on the Day of Resurrection): “O
      ‘Eesaa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)! Did you say unto men: ‘Worship
      me and my mother as two gods besides Allaah?’ ” He will say:
      “Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right (to say).
      Had I said such a thing, You would surely have known it. You know what is
      in my inner‑self though I do not know what is in Yours; truly, You,
      only You, are the All‑Knower of all that is hidden (and unseen).  “Never
      did I say to them aught except what You (Allaah) did command me to say:
      ‘Worship Allaah, my Lord and your Lord.’ And I was a witness over them
      while I dwelt amongst them, but when You took me up, You were the Watcher
      over them; and You are a Witness to all things” [al-Maa’idah
      5:116-117]
If
      people worship Prophets or scholars instead of Allaah, we should not apply
      the word Taaghoot to the object of their worship.
If people exaggerate
      about al-Shaafa’i or any other scholar (may Allaah have mercy on them),
      and call upon them for help instead of Allaah, or worships their graves,
      there is no sin on those scholars; on the contrary, the burden of sin is
      on the one who associates others in worship with Allaah (Shirk).
      The same is true in the case of the Christians who worship ‘Eesaa (Jesus
      – peace be upon him) alongside Allaah. ‘Eesaa (peace be upon him) will
      not bear any part of their burden of sin. A brief definition of Taaghoot
      is: whoever is worshipped instead of Allaah and accepts that. It is well
      known that ‘Eesaa (peace be upon him) and other Prophets, and also
      al-Shaafa’i and other scholars who believed in Allaah alone (Tawheed)
      would never accept to be worshipped instead of Allaah. On the contrary,
      they forbade that and preached the message of Tawheed. Allaah says
      (interpretation of the meaning):
“And (remember) when Allaah will say (on the Day of
      Resurrection): “O ‘Eesaa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)! Did you say
      unto men: ‘Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allaah?’ ”
      He will say: “Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no
      right (to say). Had I said such a thing, You would surely have known it.
      You know what is in my inner self though I do not know what is in Yours;
      truly, You, only You, are the All Knower of all that is hidden (and
      unseen).  “Never did I say to them aught except what You

      Lord.’ And I was a witness over them while I dwelt amongst them, but
      when You took me up, You were the Watcher over them; and You are a Witness
      to all things” [al-Maa’idah 5:116-117].

    and having a Mahram who can accompany her is one of the prerequisites for her to be able

    she is not able according to Shareeah, because in Islam a woman is forbidden to
    travel without a Mahram. Therefore Hajj is not obligatory for you unless you find a
    Mahram. So have patience until Allaah makes it easy for you to have a Mahram with whom you
    can go for Hajj. You have a valid excuse and there is no sin on you for this. As for going

    to go to Hajj. He said, Go to Hajj with her. (Reported by

5208,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5208,Neglecting prayer out of laziness,"If you do not pray salat out of laziness on purpose, are you a kafir or just a bad Muslim? Please answer.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Imaam Ahmad said that the one who does not pray because of laziness is a kaafir. This is the more correct view and is that indicated by the evidence of the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger, and by the words of the Salaf and the proper understanding.
(Al-Sharh al-Mumti’ ‘ala Zaad al-Mustanqi’, 2/26).
Anyone who examines the texts of the Quran and Sunnah will see that they indicate that the one who neglects the prayer is guilty of Kufr Akbar (major kufr) which puts him beyond the pale of Islam.
Among the evidence to be found in the Quran is:
The aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“But if they repent [by rejecting Shirk (polytheism) and accept Islamic Monotheism], perform As-Salat (Iqaamat-as-Salat) and give Zakaat, then they are your brethren in religion.” [al-Tawbah 9:11]
The evidence derived from this aayah is that Allah defined three things that the Mushrikeen have to do in order to eliminate the differences between them us: they should repent from shirk, they should perform prayer, and they should pay zakaah. If they repent from shirk but they do not perform the prayer or pay zakaah, then they are not our brethren in faith; if they perform the prayer but do not pay zakaah, then they are not our brethren in faith. Brotherhood in religion cannot be effaced except when a person goes out of the religion completely; it cannot be effaced by fisq (immoral conduct) or lesser types of kufr.
Allah also says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up As-Salat (the prayers) [i.e. made their Salat (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in their proper fixed times] and have followed lusts. So they will be thrown in Hell. Except those who repent and believe (in the Oneness of Allah and His Messenger Muhammad), and work righteousness. Such will enter Paradise and they will not be wronged in aught.” [Maryam 19:59-60]
The evidence derived from this aayah is that Allah referred to those who neglect the prayer and follow their desires, Except those who repent and believe, which indicates that at the time when they are neglecting their prayers and following their desires, they are not believers.
The evidence of the Sunnah that proves that the one who neglects the prayer is a kaafir includes the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Between a man and shirk and kufr there stands his neglect of the prayer.”
(Narrated by Muslim in Kitaab al-Eemaan from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)).
It was narrated that Buraydah ibn al-Husayb (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: ‘The covenant that distinguishes between us and them is the prayer, and whoever neglects it has disbelieved (become a kaafir).’”
(It was narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi, al-Nisaa’i and Ibn Maajah). What is meant here by kufr or disbelief is the kind of kufr which puts a person beyond the pale of Islam, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made prayer the dividing line between the believers and the disbelievers. It is known that the community of kufr is not the same as the community of Islam, so whoever does not fulfil this covenant must be one of the kaafireen (disbelievers).
There is also the hadeeth of ‘Awf ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of your leaders are those whom you love and who love you, who pray for you and you pray for them. The worst of your leaders are those whom you hate and who hate you, and you send curses on them and they send curses on you.” He was asked, “O Messenger of Allah, should we not fight them by the sword?” He said, “Not as long as they are establishing prayer amongst you.”
This hadeeth indicates that those in authority should be opposed and fought if they do not establish prayer, but it is not permissible to oppose and fight them unless they make a blatant show of kufr and we have evidence from Allah that what they are doing is indeed kufr. ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called us and we gave bay’ah (oath of allegiance) to him. Among the things that we pledged to do was to listen and obey him both when we felt enthusiastic and when we were disinclined to act, both at times of difficulty and times of ease, and at times when others were given preference over us, and that we would not oppose those in authority. He said: ‘unless they made a blatant show of kufr and you have evidence from Allah that what they are doing is indeed kufr.’”
(Agreed upon). On this basis, their neglecting the prayer, for which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said we should oppose them and fight them by the sword, constitutes an act of blatant kufr for which we have evidence from Allah that it is indeed kufr.
If someone were to say: is it not permissible to interpret the texts about a person who neglects prayer being a kaafir as referring to the one who neglects the prayer because he does not think it is obligatory?
We would say: it is not permissible to interpret the texts in this way because there are two reservations about this interpretation:


it involves ignoring the general description that the Lawgiver took into consideration and to which the ruling was connected. The ruling that the person who neglects prayer is a kaafir is connected to the action of neglecting prayer, not to his denial of it being obligatory. Brotherhood in religion is based on performing the prayer, not on whether a person declares it to be obligatory. Allah did not say, “If they repent and state that the prayer is obligatory”, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not say “Between a man and shirk and kufr there stands his denial that the prayer is obligatory” or “The covenant that distinguishes between us and them is our statement that the prayer is obligatory, so whoever denies that it is obligatory has disbelieved.” If this is what Allah and His Messenger had meant, then not stating it clearly would have contradicted what is said in the Quran. For Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):


“And We have sent down to you the Book (the Quran) as an exposition of everything” [al-Nahl 16:89]
“And We have also sent down unto you (O Muhammad) the Dhikr [reminder and the advice (i.e. the Quran)], that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them” [al-Nahl 16:44]
It is not correct to refer to a reason which the Lawgiver did not make a factor in ruling a person to be a kaafir, because if a person who does not have the excuse of ignorance denies that the five daily prayers are obligatory then he is deemed to be a kaafir, whether he prays or not. If a person performs the five daily prayers, fulfilling all the conditions of prayer and doing all the actions that are obligatory or mustahabb, but he denies that the prayers are obligatory with no valid reason for doing so, then he is a kaafir, even though he is not neglecting the prayers. From this it is clear that it is not correct to interpret the texts about neglecting the prayers as referring to denying that they are obligatory. The correct view is that the person who neglects the prayer is a kaafir who is beyond the pale of Islam, as is clearly stated in the report narrated by Ibn Abi Haatim in his Sunan from ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) exhorted us: ‘Do not associate anything in worship with Allah, and do not neglect the prayer deliberately, for whoever neglects the prayer deliberately puts himself beyond the pale of Islam.” Moreover, if we interpret the ahadith about neglecting the prayer as referring to a denial that it is obligatory, there would be no point in the reports referring specifically to the prayer, because this ruling applies equally to zakaah, fasting and Hajj – whoever neglects any of these, denying that it is obligatory, is a kaafir, if he does not have the excuse of ignorance.
Just as the one who neglects the prayer is deemed to be a kaafir on the basis of the evidence of the texts and reports, so he may also be deemed to be a kaafir on the basis of rational analysis. How can a person be a believer if he neglects the prayer which is the pillar of religion, and when there are aayaat and ahadith urging us to perform prayer which make the wise believer rush to do the prayer, and when there are aayaat and ahadith warning against neglecting it, which make the wise believer scared to ignore the prayer? Once we have understood this, a person cannot be a believer if he neglects the prayer.
If a person were to say: can we not interpret kufr in the case of one who neglects the prayer as meaning a lesser form of kufr (kufr al-na’mah) rather than the kind of kufr which puts a person beyond the pale of Islam (kufr al-millah)? Or can we not interpret it as being less than Kufr Akbar (major kufr) and more like the kufr referred to in the ahadith, “There are two qualities that exist among people which are qualities of kufr: slandering people’s lineage and wailing over the dead” and “Trading insults with a Muslim is fisq (immoral conduct) and exchanging blows with him is kufr”, etc.?
We would say that this interpretation is not correct for a number of reasons:


The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made prayer the dividing line between kufr and faith, between the believer and the disbeliever. This is where he drew the line, and the two things are quite distinct and do not overlap.


Prayer is one of the pillars of Islam, so when the person who neglects it is described as a kaafir, this implies the kind of kufr that puts a person beyond the pale of Islam, because he has destroyed one of the pillars of Islam. This is a different matter from attributing kufr to a person who does one of the actions of kufr.


There are other texts which indicate that the kufr of the one who neglects the prayer is the kind of kufr which puts a person beyond the pale of Islam, so what is meant here by kufr should be interpreted according to the apparent meaning, so as avoid contradictions between the texts.


The description of kufr in those ahadith is different. Concerning neglecting the prayer, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Between a man and shirk and kufr.” Here the word kufr is preceded in the original Arabic by the definite article “al”, which indicates that what is referred to here is the reality of kufr. This is in contrast to the other ahadith where kufr is referred to without the definite article, or in a verbal form, which indicates that this is a part of kufr or that the person has disbelieved by doing this action, but it is not the absolute kufr which places a person beyond the pale of Islam.


Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in his book Iqtidaa’ al-Siraat al-Mustaqeem
(p. 70, Al-Sunnah Al-Muhammadiyyah edn.), concerning the hadeeth of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ““There are two qualities that exist among people which are qualities of kufr”:
“The phrase ‘which are qualities of kufr’ means that these two qualities which exist among people are qualities of kufr because they are among the deeds of kufr and they exist among people. But not everyone who has a part of kufr becomes a kaafir because of it, unless there exists in his heart the reality of kufr. Similarly, not everyone who has a part of faith becomes a believer because of it, unless there exists in his heart the essential reality of faith. So there is a distinction between kufr that is preceded [in the original Arabic] by the definite article “al”, as in the hadeeth ‘Between a man and shirk and kufr there stands nothing but his neglecting the prayer’, and kufr that is not preceded by the definite article but is used in an affirmative sense.’”
So it is clear that the person who neglects the prayer with no excuse is a kaafir who is beyond the pale of Islam, on the basis of this evidence. This is the correct view according to Imaam Ahmad, and it is one of the two opinions narrated from al-Shaafa’i, as was mentioned by Ibn Katheer in his tafseer of the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up As-Salat (the prayers) [i.e. made their Salat (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in their proper fixed times] and have followed lusts” [Maryam 19:59]
Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned in his book Al-Salaah that it was one of the two views narrated from al-Shaafa’i, and that al-Tahhaawi narrated it from al-Shaafa’i himself.
This was also the view of the majority of the Sahaabah, indeed many narrated that there was consensus among the Sahaabah on this point. ‘Abd-Allah ibn Shaqeeq said: the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not think that neglecting any deed made a person a kaafir, apart from neglecting the prayer. This was reported by al-Tirmidhi and al-Haakim, who classed it as saheeh according to the conditions of (al-Bukhaari and Muslim). Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh, the well known imaam, said, It was reported with a saheeh isnaad from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that the one who neglects the prayer is a kaafir. This was also the view of the scholars from the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) until the present day: that the person who deliberately neglects the prayer with no valid excuse, until the time for that prayer is over, is a kaafir. Ibn Hazm said that it was reported from ‘Umar, ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Awf, Mu’aadh ibn Jabal, Abu Hurayrah and others among the Sahaabah. He said: “We do not know of any opposing view among the Sahaabah.” Al-Mundhiri narrated this from him in Al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb, and added more names of Sahaabah: ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood, ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abbaas, Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah and Abu’l-Dardaa’ – may Allah be pleased with them. He said: apart from the Sahaabah, there are also Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh, ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Mubaarak, al-Nakha’i, al-Hakam ibn ‘Utaybah, Ayyoob al-Sakhtayaani, Abu Daawood al-Tayaalisi, Abu Bakr ibn Abi Shaybah, Zuhayr ibn Harb and others.

There is no such evidence that touching dogs or their saliva have this effect. It was not mentioned by the scholars among the things that nullify wudu.
Ibn Qudamah mentioned in al-Mughni (1/264) things that nullify wudu, and he did not mention touching dogs or their saliva. Then he said: These are all the things that nullify taharah, and it cannot be nullified by anything else according to the view of the majority of scholars
But there is no doubt that dogs saliva is very dirty and extremely impure, and it can only be removed by washing seven times, one of them with earth. There is a difference between this and something which nullifies taharah.

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Beware of newly-invented matters, for every newly-invented matter is an innovation (bid’ah) and every innovation is a going-astray.”
(Narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi and others).
He also said: “Every people has its festival (‘Eid) and this is our festival.”
(Agreed upon)
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) spoke at length in his book Iqtidaa’ al-Siraat al-Mustaqeem li Mukhaalifat Ashaab al-Jaheem (The Requirements of the Straight Path in Differing from the People of Hell), condemning the innovated occasions and festivals that have no basis in the pure Sharee’ah and the ways in which they corrupt people’s religious commitment. Most if not all of the people have no understanding of the damage caused by this kind of bid’ah, especially when it has to do with acts of worship, but those who are blessed with insight and understanding realize something of the damage that it can do.
What people have to do is to follow the Qur’aan and Sunnah, even when they do not entirely understand the issues of benefit and harm that are involved.
Whoever innovates something on a certain day, such as observing a fast, performing a prayer, preparing certain foods, putting up decorations, spending on his family and so on, will be affected by this and it will create some kind of belief in his heart, because he must believe that this day is better than other days, since if he and those who follow him did not have this belief in their hearts, they would not make the effort to do these things.
“Celebration” or “festival” involves three things: place, time and gathering, in any of which things may be innovated.
With regard to time, there are three kinds of innovation, which may overlap with issues of place and actions.
The first kind is a day which is not venerated at all in Sharee’ah, which was not mentioned by the Salaf and nothing happened on that day to indicate that it should be held in any kind of esteem.
The second kind is a day on which some event happened that also happened on other days, but that does not mean that it should be regarded as a special occasion, and the Salaf did not venerate this day.
Whoever does such a thing is imitating the Christians, who took the days of events in the life of Jesus (peace be upon him) as festivals, and the Jews. But festivals are part of Sharee’ah, and whatever has been prescribed by Allah should be followed, but whatever has been innovated in the religion is not a part of Islam.
Similarly, the innovation followed by some people (in celebrating the Prophet’s birthday), whether it is done in imitation of the Christian celebration of the birth of Jesus, peace be upon him, or it is done out of love and respect for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), is not something which was done by the Salaf, even though the reason for doing it was there and there was nothing to stop them doing it if it was good…
The third kind is days which are venerated by Sharee’ah, such as the day of ‘Aashooraa’, the day of ‘Arafaah and the two Eid days, etc., but the people who follow their own desires innovate things that they think are good but which in fact are wrong and are not allowed – such as when the Raafidis go without water and express grief on the day of ‘Aashooraa’ etc. These are innovated matters which were not prescribed by Allah or by His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or by any of the Salaf or the members of the household of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
As regards holding regular gatherings, whether weekly, monthly or annually, apart from the gatherings that are prescribed in Sharee’ah, this implies that one is making them as important as the gatherings for the five daily prayers, Jumu’ah, Eid and Hajj, and this is a newly-invented innovation.
The principle in question here is: the Islamic acts of worship which are repeated at certain intervals and are thus special occasions, have been prescribed by Allah and are sufficient for mankind. If any other gatherings are invented in addition to these gatherings, it means that they are being given a status equal to that of the occasions prescribed by Allah, which leads to the adverse effects referred to above. This is in contrast to what a person or a small specialized group may undertake on their own sometimes.
On the basis of the above: it is not permissible for the Muslim to take part in these events which are celebrated regularly every year, because of their resemblence to the prescribed Islamic festivals, as explained above. But if it is a “one-off” event that is not repeated, and the Muslim can use the occasion to convey the truth to people, then there is nothing wrong with that, in sha Allah.

 (peace and

    were any crosses without erasing them or – according to another report –cutting

This hadeeth indicates that if the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) saw a cross on something, he would not leave it without blotting it
    out, or cutting it out if it was still visible after blotting it out, because the cross is
    something that is worshipped instead of Allaah, and its presence is something
    objectionable (munkar) which must be changed. This is a summary of what was said by
    Al-Haafiz in Al-Fath.
It was also reported that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah
    be upon him) said:
“Whoever among you sees an evil action (munkar), let him change it
    with his hand [by taking action], and if he cannot, then with his tongue [by speaking
    out], and if he cannot, then with his heart [by feeling that it is wrong], and that is the

 (peace and blessings of Allaah be

    built-up grave without levelling it.’”
These two ahaadeeth indicate that it is obligatory to change, remove or
    blot out any objectionable thing (munkar). The symbols of kufr (including the six-pointed

    Quba and found his son Aasim playing in the courtyard of the mosque. He took
    him by the arm and seated him in front of him on his riding-animal, but the childs
    grandmother caught up with him and fought with him over the child until they went to Abu
    Bakr al-Siddeeq. Umar said, (He is) my son! and the woman said,
    (He is) my son! Abu Bakr said: Leave them alone, and Umar
    did not answer back. (Narrated by Maalik in al-Muwatta, 2/767;
    al-Bayhaqi, 8/5). Ibn Abd al-Barr said: this hadeeth is well known
    with a variety of isnaads, complete and incomplete, and is accepted by the scholars.
    According to some reports, [Abu Bakr] said: the mother is more
    compassionate, more kind, more merciful, more loving and more generous, and she has more
    right to her child unless she remarries.
Abu Bakrs description of the mother as being more compassionate
    and more kind is the reason why the mother has more right to the custody of her young
    child. And Allaah knows best.","(See Fiqh al-Sunnah, 2/289-290)"

If so, what are they? Some imams stay for a long time in the final Tashahhud and the people praying behind them do not know what they are saying.","The Prophet Muhammad said: “When any one of you recites the Tashahhud, let him seek refuge with Allah from four things – from the punishment of Hell, the punishment of the grave, the trials of life and death, and the evils of the Dajjal, then let him pray for himself for whatever he wants.” For more about du’a in the final tashahhud, see the detailed answer.",,"Praise be to Allah.Du’a after Tashahhud
Abu Hurayrah said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you recites the Tashahhud [according to one report: when any one of you finishes the final Tashuhhud ], let him seek refuge with Allah from four things, let him say: ‘Allahumma inni ‘a'udhu bika min 'adhabi Jahannam wa min ‘adhab al-qabri wa min fitnat il-mahya wa’l-mamat wa min sharri fitnat il-masih id-dajjal (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the punishment of Hell and the punishment of the grave, and from the trials of life and death and from the worst of the turmoil of the Dajjal (antichrist)).’” Sahih Muslim, 588.
It was also narrated that in addition to seeking refuge from these four, one should also seek refuge from sin and heavy debt. 
Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated from ‘Aishah, the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say during his prayer: “Allahumma inni a’udhu bika min ‘adhab al-qabri wa a’udhi bika min fitnat il-masih id-dajjal wa a’udhi bika min fitnat il-mahya wa fitnat il-mamat. Allahumma inni a'udhu bika min al-matham wa’l-maghram (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the punishment of the grave and I seek refuge with You from the turmoil of the Dajjal and I seek refuge with You from the trials of life and the trials of death. O Allah, I seek refuge with You from sin and heavy debt).’” Someone said to him: “How often you seek refuge from heavy debt!” He said: “When a man gets into debt, he speaks and tells lies, and he makes a promise and breaks it.” (al-Bukhari, 833)
It was also narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught Abu Bakr al-Siddiq a du’a which he could recite during his Salah, as was narrated by al-Bukhari. Abu Bakr al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) said to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Teach me a du’a that I can recite during my salah.” He said: “Say: ‘Allahumma inni zalamtu nafsi zulman kathiran wa la yaghfir ul-dhunoob illa anta, faghfir li maghfiratan min ‘indaka warhamni, innaka anta al-Ghafoor al-Rahim (O Allah, indeed I have wronged myself greatly, and there is none who forgives sins besides You. So grant me forgiveness from You and have mercy on me, for You are the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful).’” (790). 
This du’a may be recited in the final Tashahhud , after the prayers seeking refuge referred to above.
It was also narrated that after reciting the prayers seeking refuge, a person may recite any good du’a he wishes, and may ask Allah for anything he wishes of the good things of this world and the next. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you recites the Tashahhud , let him seek refuge with Allah from four things – from the punishment of Hell, the punishment of the grave, the trials of life and death, and the evils of the Dajjal, then let him pray for himself for whatever he wants.” (Narrated by al-Nasai, 1293).

This cannot be argued since it is found clearly in the Book of Allaah. Of course we realize also that there are a few differences of opinion amongst the scholars in certain circumstances. Today I wish to ask about a particular circumstance: 
We live in a city in Canada and as you may be aware, Canada is a country made up of immigrants from all parts of the world. 
Therefore, if you were to go to a slaughter house you would find people from many different backgrounds working there. You may find Muslims, Jews, Budhists, Christians, Sikhs, atheists, etc.. working there. Of them there are those who are responsible for killing the animals. Generally it is not known to the masses who it is that is killing the animals (i.e. it could be an individual of any faith, we have no guarantee who it is) and so can we say that since we live in such a country then it is not important to know that information and that we should just eat the meat found in the market place? 
I ask this keeping in mind that there are Muslims who do slaughter in the Islaamic way and sell that meat. In fact dear Shaykh, this is a fitnah for many people and the problem is that they ask the Mashaayikh in most cases without explaining the details I just mentioned. It would be most helpful if you could clarify for us this issue in some detail.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Muslim has to be careful with regard to 
          this matter, and try to ensure that his food, drink and clothing are

          as atheists and Sikhs etc., who are not Jews or Christians, is not permitted

 One of us Muslims could do the actual

 Conclusion: 
 If it is slaughtered by a Muslim or 
          one of the People of the Book (a Jew or Christian), that is fine. If

    religion of Allaah as much as he is able to. The imaamah (Islamic political leadership)
    has been prescribed for the purpose of establishing the religion of Allaah. No one should
    think that the fact that there is no imaam at any given time in any given country means
    that we can be negligent and introverted and not practise or establish any aspect of the
    religion. Among the people of misguidance during this age and at other times there are
    those who say that we do not need to establish any of the symbols of Islam until a
    khaleefah has been appointed over the Muslims and the Islamic state has been established.
    This is one of the worst kinds of misguidance, and believing this leads to abandoning

    Allaah, the most important aspect of which is knowledge of the teaching of Tawheed, then
    establishing the symbols and rituals of Islam and the other duties. No doubt occupying
    oneself with these things is the most important thing, and each person should do
    everything that he is able to do. There cannot be an Islamic state without proper
    understanding of the religion and achieving eemaan (faith) and Tawheed, and
    ridding ourselves of shirk, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
Allaah has promised those among you who believe and do
    righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers)

    authority to practise their religion which He has chosen for them (i.e. Islam). And He

However, for married couples, the usage is that both the husband and the wife sleep next to each other in the same large bed. I believe that this is not compatible with sunna, and would like to know your opinion. Jazakom allahou khayran.",,,"Praise be to Allah.On the contrary, it is part of the Sunnah, as is indicated by many ahaadeeth, including that narrated by al-Bukhaari (2945) and Muslim (2727) from ‘Ali, who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him and Faatimah, may Allah be pleased with them both: “When you go to your bed, or when you lie down, say Allahu akbar thirty-three times, Subhaan-Allah thirty-three times and Alhamdulillaah thirty-three times.” According to another report narrated by al-Bukhaari (3502), [‘Ali said:] “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to us whilst we were lying down, and I went to stand up, but he said, ‘Stay where you are,’ and sat down between us, and I could feel the coolness of his feet on my chest.’”
This hadeeth with its clear wording indicates that it is sunnah for a man to sleep with his wife in one bed. Perhaps the confusion has arisen because when a man does wudu then sleeps in one bed with his wife, he cannot help touching her, and it may be that the questioner is thinking that this will break his wudu, so what is the point of doing wudu? So we have to discuss the question of whether touching a woman breaks wudu or not?
The scholars differed on this matter and there are several points of view, stemming from their differences in the Tafseer (interpretation) of the Aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“… or [if] you have been in contact with women and you find no water, perform Tayammum with clean earth…” [al-Nisa’ 4:43]
Some scholars said that “contact” here meant only touching with one’s hand, whilst others took it to mean sexual intercourse, as in the aayaat (interpretation of the meaning):
“… then divorce them before you have sexual intercourse with them…” [al-Ahzaab 33:49]
and:
“And if you divorce them before you have touched (had sexual relations with) them…” [al-Baqarah 2:237]
They stated that according to scholarly consensus, the full mahr is not due if a woman has been merely touched before her divorce; the full mahr is due in cases where sexual intercourse has taken place and the marriage has been consummated. This opinion was narrated from ‘Ali, Ubayy ibn Ka’b, Ibn ‘Abbaas, Mujaahid, Taawoos, al-Hasan, ‘Ubayd ibn ‘Umayr, Sa’eed ibn Jubayr, al-Shu’bi, Qutaadah, Muqaatil ibn Hayyaan and Abu Haneefah.”
(Nayl al-Maraam min Tafseer Ayaat al-Ahkaam by Siddeeq Hasan Khaan, 1/316, 314).
The more correct view is that which was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would do wudu, then kiss her, and then pray, without repeating his wudu.
(See al-Raayah, 1/72; Nayl al-Maraam by Siddeeq Hasan Khaan, 318-322 – footnote).
Al-Bukhaari narrated in al-Saheeh (1/588, no. 513) that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “I used to sleep in front of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and my legs were in front of him when he prayed. When he did sujood, he would poke me and I would move my legs out of the way, and when he stood up I would stretch them out again… The houses in those days did not have lamps.”
These two texts indicate that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would touch his wife, without repeating his wudu after doing so; he even touched her whilst praying. The Sunnah, which explains the Book of Allah, indicates that merely touching a woman does not cancel wudu. However, if there is any emission of madhiy (prostatic fluid) or maniy (semen), then this breaks wudu.
We hope that this answer will clear up the confusion and free the questioner from any unnecessary restrictions. And Allah is the One Whose help we seek.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
5288,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5288,"Ruling on a woman
    whose husband has disappeared","does being abandond for nine months by your
      husband neither seeing or knowing his were abouts justify a Khuli divorce,and if so does she have to wait the Iddah before remarrying?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If what is meant in the question is that this woman has
    had no news of her husband, i.e., he has vanished, then this is an issue which the
    fuqahaa’ (may Allaah have mercy on him) called “a woman whose husband has
    disappeared”, meaning that there is no longer any news of him. The fuqahaa’ (may
    Allaah have mercy on him) have many views on how long a woman should wait until her
    husband may be presumed dead. According to the most correct scholarly view, the
    determination of this period should be left to the discretion of the judge, and it may
    vary according to the times and circumstances. The judge should use his best judgement
    (ijtihaad) to determine a time limit after which it may be assumed that the husband is
    dead, and when that time has passed he should issue a ruling to that effect. Then the
    woman should observe the ‘iddah of one whose husband has died, i.e., four months and
    ten days, after which she is free to remarry.
If she knows where he is and that he has abandoned her for this length
    of time, then the ruling is that of a woman whose husband has taken an oath not to have
    sexual relations with his wife [see al-Baqarah 2:226]. So the woman or her wali (guardian)
    should write to him, or the matter may be referred to the judge, so that the husband may
    be forced to return to her. If he refuses then the judge can decree that she is divorced
    or the marriage is annulled. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
5289,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5289,"The condition he put in his vow came to pass, but    it was not exactly what he had in mind","A person vowed that if his work contract was renewed, he would give a certain amount in charity. In his mind he meant that this was if it was renewed for a year, but it turned out that his contract was renewed for three months. He did not utter the words “one year”. Is he under any obligation?",,,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, who answered as follows:
No, he is not under any obligation. And Allah knows best.",Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen
