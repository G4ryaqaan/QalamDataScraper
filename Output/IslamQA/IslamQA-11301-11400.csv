11301,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11301,What is the meaning of Allaahs name al-Hayiy?,What is the meaning of Allaah’s name al-Hayiy (the Modest)?,,,"Praise be to Allah.The 
          Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
          Allaah be upon him) described his Lord as being modest. The modesty 
          of Allaah cannot be comprehended by human understanding, and no mind 
          can understand its nature. It is modesty that is based on kindness, 
          goodness, generosity and majesty. By His mercy, generosity, perfection 
          and forbearance, Allaah is too modest to expose His slaves, show them 
          up or carry out His punishment on them. He is too modest to reject anyone 
          who stretches forth his hand to Him, and He loves people who are modest. 
          
 Ibn 
          al-Qayyim said: 
 “He 
          is the Modest who does not expose His slave even though he audaciously 
          commits sin. 
But 
          He covers him, for He is the Concealer, the One Who forgives.”","Sharh Asmaa Allaah taaala al-Husnaa, by Dr. Hissah al-Sagheer, p. 114"

          Who is above all that is not befitting to Him and He is above all the 
          shortcomings and (imperfect) qualities which are inherent in His creation.","Sharh Asmaa’ Allaah ta’aala al-Husna by Dr. Hissah al-Sagheer, p. 138"
11309,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11309,The kufr of those who rule by man-made laws,"Is the one who fails to rule by that which Allaah has revealed and bases the entire legal system on man-made laws a kaafir? Should we differentiate between him and one who judges according to sharee’ah, but may rule in a manner contrary to sharee’ah on some issues, because of his own whims and desires or because of a bribe, etc.?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, 
          we must make this distinction. The one who rejects the law of Allaah 
          and casts it aside, and replaces it with man-made laws and the opinions 
          of individuals has committed an act of kufr which puts him beyond the 
          pale of Islam. Whereas the one who adheres to the religion of Islam, 
          but is a sinner and wrongdoer by virtue of his following his whims and 
          desires in some cases, or pursuing some worldly interest, but admits 
          that he is a wrongdoer by doing so, is not guilty of kufr which would 
          put him beyond the pale of Islam. 
 Whoever 
          thinks that ruling by man-made laws is equal to ruling by sharee’ah, 
          and thinks that it is OK to do that, is also guilty of kufr that puts 
          him beyond the pale of Islam, even if it is only in one instance.",Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah al-Ghunaymaan

          is the Bestower of forms. His creation is as is He wills, and He is 
          the One Who formed and gave shape to all that exists. He has given everything 
          its own form and distinct shape, even though His creation is so great 
          and so varied. He has bestowed forms, not by way of copying – glorified 
          and exalted be He far above such a thing. 
 When 
          He wills a thing, He merely says to it “Be!” and it is, with the attributes 
          that He wills and the form that He has chosen for it. He does what He 
          wills and creates what He wills in the form that He wills. 
 Some 
          scholars differentiated between al-Khaaliq (the Creator), al-Baari’ 
          (the Maker) and al-Musawwir (the Bestower of forms) as follows: 
 Al-Khaaliq 
          (the Creator) is the One Who created from nothing all creatures that 
          exist, according to their decreed qualities. 
 Al-Baari’ 
          is the One Who made man from al-baraa, 
          i.e., clay. 
 Al-Musawwir 
          is the One Who creates various forms and shapes. 
 So 
          al-Khaaliq is a general word, al-Baari’ is more specific and al-Musawwir

of the meaning)And Allaah will never lead a people astray after He has guided them until He makes clear to them as to what they should avoid. Verily, Allaah is the All-Knower of everything” [al-Tawbah 9:115]",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah says, describing 
          His noble Self and His just Wisdom, that He does not lead people astray 
          except after His Message has reached them, and proof has been established 
          against them, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And 
          as for Thamood, We showed and made clear to them the Path of Truth (Islamic 
          Monotheism) through Our Messenger (i.e. showed them the way of success), 
          but they preferred blindness to guidance” [Fussilat 41:17] 
 According 
          to another view on the interpretation of this aayah, Mujaahid said concerning 
          the aayah (interpretation of the

“And 
          Allaah will never lead a people astray after He has guided them” [al-Tawbah 
          9:115] . This aayah 
          refers to the issue of believers praying for forgiveness for the mushrikeen 
          in particular. Allaah has made clear the ruling on this matter, it becomes 
          a sin, so it is their choice whether they do it or not. 
 Ibn 
          Jareer said: Allaah is saying that He would not decree misguidance for 
          them as a result of their seeking forgiveness for their dead mushrik 
          relatives, after He had guided them and given them faith in Him and 
          His Messenger, until He had told them of the prohibition so that they

“Allaah bears witness that Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He)” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:18]
 Al-Mu’min is the one Who accepts His believing slaves, i.e., He accepts their faith and sincerity and makes them steadfast. And He fulfils His promise to His slave of reward.
 He gives security to His close friends (awliya’) by keeping them safe from His punishment and torment. So they are safe, and no one is safe except those to whom He grants safety. He fulfils what His slaves think of Him and never allows their hopes to be dashed.
 He is the one Who declared Himself to be One, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):

Expiation for breaking ihram rules","Praise be to Allah.Things to avoid in ihram
The things which are forbidden in ihram are things which a person must refrain from doing because of being in ihram. They are: 
1.Shaving the hair of the head, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and do not shave your heads until the Hady [sacrificial animal] reaches the place of sacrifice.” [al-Baqarah 2:196]
The scholars added to the prohibition on shaving the head, the prohibition on shaving any hair on the body, and on `. 
2.Using perfume after entering ihram , whether on one’s clothes or body, or in one's food or when washing the deceased muhrim or in any way whatsoever. Using perfume is forbidden in ihram because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said concerning a man whose camel trampled him to death, “Wash him with water and lotus leaves and shroud him in his two garments, but do not cover his head or perfume him with hanut.” Hanut is a mixture of perfumes that is usually applied to the deceased. 
3.Intercourse, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“So whosoever intends to perform Hajj therein (by assuming Ihram), then he should not have sexual relations (with his wife), nor commit sin, nor dispute unjustly during the Hajj.” [al-Baqarah 2:197] 
4.Touching one’s wife with desire , because this comes under the general meaning of the phrase “he should not have sexual relations (with his wife)”, and because it is not permissible for the muhrim (person in ihram) to get married or to propose marriage – so it is more likely that it is not permissible for him to touch his wife with desire. 
5.Killing game (hunting), because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning: 
“O you who believe! Kill not the game while you are in a state of Ihram [for Hajj or ‘Umrah (pilgrimage)].” [al-Maidah 5:95]
As for cutting down the trees, that is not haram for the muhrim, except for those trees within the amyal, i.e., the boundaries of the sanctuary, cutting which is forbidden whether one is in ihram or not. Hence it is permissible to cut down trees in ‘Arafah even if one is in ihram, because the prohibition on cutting down trees is connected to the Haram (sanctuary), not ihram. 
6. A prohibition which applies exclusively to men is wearing shirts, hooded robes, trousers, turbans and leather slippers, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about what the muhrim should wear. He said: “He should not wear a shirt, hooded robe (burnus), trousers, a turban or leather slippers.” But he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made an exception for one who cannot find an izar (lower garment or waist wrapper), who may wear trousers, and one who cannot find sandals, who may wear leather slippers. 
These five things are described by the scholars as wearing sewn garments , so the common folk imagine that wearing sewn garments means wearing clothes that have stitching in them, but that is not the case. What the scholars meant by that is wearing clothes that are tailored to fit the body or part of it, such as shirts and trousers. This is what they meant. Hence if a person wears a rida (upper garment) or izar (lower garment) with patches on it, that is o.k., but if he wears a woven shirt with no stitching, that is haram. 
7. One of the prohibitions of ihram that applies only to women is niqab , which refers to a veil that covers the face and leaves the eyes uncovered, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade that. A similar prohibition applies to the burqa’. When a woman enters ihram, she should not wear a niqab or burqa’ . It is prescribed for her to leave her face uncovered except when a non-mahram man passes by her, when she must cover her face and it does not matter if this cover touches her face. 
Expiation for breaking ihram rules
With regard to the one who does any of these forbidden things out of forgetfulness or ignorance or because he is forced to do so, he does not have to offer any expiation, because Allah says: 
“And there is no sin on you concerning that in which you made a mistake except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend.” [al-Ahzab 33:5]
And Allah says concerning killing game or hunting, which is one of the things that are forbidden in ihram (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Kill not the game while you are in a state of Ihram [for Hajj or ‘Umrah (pilgrimage)], and whosoever of you kills it intentionally, the penalty is an offering, brought to the Ka‘bah, of an eatable animal (i.e. sheep, goat, cow) equivalent to the one he killed.” [al-Maidah 5:95]
These texts indicate that whoever does one of the prohibited actions out of forgetfulness or ignorance does not have to offer any expiation. 
The same applies if he is forced to do it, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Whoever disbelieved in Allah after his belief, except him who is forced thereto and whose heart is at rest with Faith; but such as open their breasts to disbelief, on them is wrath from Allah, and theirs will be a great torment”[al-Nahl 16:106]
If that is what is said about being forced into disbelief, it is more likely that no expiation would be required concerning less serious matters. 
But if the person who forgot remembers, he has to stop doing the forbidden thing, and if one who was ignorant of it comes to know, he has to stop doing the forbidden thing, and if the pressure is lifted from the one from who is being forced, he has to stop doing the forbidden thing. 
For example, if a muhrim covers his head because he forgot, then he remembers, then he has to remove the cover, and if he washes his hand with perfume then he remembers, he has to wash it until the perfume is removed, and so on.

Is there any way a young woman can protect herself from the evil eye without veiling her face?  Can wearing Quranic scripture save you from the evil eye?  And what about wearing necklaces and charms in the shape of an eye or hands because I heard these can protect you and are they haram? 
My life is so much better now than before because before I did not practice Islam although I always was a Muslim, so does this mean that because I am a better Muslim the evil eye, if I was unfortunate enough to have it hit me has disappeared from my soul or do I have to have Quran read over me so it will leave me? How can I save and protect myself from this happening to me again?","To protect yourself from the evil eye, you should: 
1- Get close to Allah;
2- Read the Quran;
3- Make a lot of du’a;
4- Recite the adhkar, and
5- Use ruqyah as it is one of the greatest remedies that the believer should use regularly.","Hijab is an obligation


Does wearing Quranic verses protect from the evil eye?


Du’a for evil eye protection


Reference","Praise be to Allah.Hijab is an obligation
You should know that hijab is obligatory , and no one has the right to choose the rulings that they like and leave those for which they feel no inclination, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Enter perfectly in Islam (by obeying all the rules and regulations of the Islamic religion) and follow not the footsteps of Shaytan (Satan). Verily, he is to you a plain enemy” [al-Baqarah 2:208] 
Ibn Kathir said: 
“Allah commands His believing slaves to adhere to all the rulings and laws of Islam, to follow all the commandments and heed all the prohibitions.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 1/566). 
The believing women are forbidden to show any of their beauty to non-mahrams. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“… and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent (like both eyes for necessity to see the way, or outer palms of hands or one eye or dress like veil, gloves, headcover, apron), and to draw their veils all over Juyubihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms) and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband’s fathers, or their sons, or their husband’s sons, or their brothers or their brother’s sons, or their sister’s sons, or their women, or the (female) slaves whom their right hands possess, or old male servants who lack vigour, or small children who have no sense of feminine sex. And let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment. And all of you beg Allah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful” [al-Nur 24:31] 
Obeying Allah’s command to observe hijab will protect you from the evil eye by Allah’s leave in this world, and will protect you from the punishment of Allah in the Hereafter. 
Does wearing Quranic verses protect from the evil eye?
With regard to wearing Quranic verses or certain shapes , Imam Ahmad narrated in his Musnad from ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever wears an amulet, may Allah not fulfil his need, and whoever wears seashells [for protection from the evil eye] may Allah not protect him.” 
According to another report, a group came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he accepted the bay’ah [allegiance] of nine of them, but not from one of them. They said, “O Messenger of Allah, you accepted the bay’ah of nine and not from this one.” He said, “He is wearing an amulet.” Then he took it in his hand and broke it, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) accepted his bay’ah. He said, “Whoever wears an amulet is guilty of shirk.” (From Fatawa al-‘Ayn wa’l-Hasad, p. 277) 
Du’a for evil eye protection
With regard to dealing with the evil eye and hasad (destructive envy), there is no doubt that when a person is close to Allah, always remembering Him (dhikr) and reading Quran, he is less likely to be affected by the evil eye and other kinds of harm from the devils of mankind and the jinn. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to seek refuge with Allah for himself, and the greatest means of seeking refuge that is available to the Muslim is reading the Book of Allah, above all the Mu’wwadhatayn (the last two Surahs of the Quran, al-Falaq and al-Nas), Surat al-Fatihah and Ayat al-Kursiy [al-Baqarah 2:255]. 
Among the sahih du’as for refuge that have been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) are: 
“A’udhu bi kalimat Allah al-tammati min sharri ma khalaq (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from the evil of that which He has created).” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Dhikr wa’l-Du’a, 4881) 
It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to seek refuge with Allah for al-Hasan and al-Husayn. He said: ‘Your father [i.e., Ibrahim] used to seek refuge with Allah for Isma’il and Isha-aq with these words: A’udhu bi kalimat Allah al-tammah min kulli shaytanin wa hammah wa min kulli ‘aynin lammah (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah, from every devil and every poisonous reptile, and from every bad eye).’”(Narrated by al-Bukhari, Ahadith al-Anbiya, 3120). 
With regard to the meaning of lammah (translated here as “bad”), al-Khattabi said: “What is meant here is every disease or harm that a person may suffer such as insanity or mental disturbance.” 
It was narrated from Abu Sa’id that Jibreel came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “O Muhammad, are you ill?” He said, “Yes.” He said, “Bismillahi arqeeka min kulli shayin yudheeka, min sharri kulli nafsin aw ‘aynin hasid Allahu yashfik, bismillahi arqeek (In the name of Allah I perform ruqyah for you, from everything that is harming you, from the evil of every soul or envious eye may Allah heal you, in the name of Allah I perform ruqyah for you).” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Salam, 4056) 
Undoubtedly, when a person persists in reciting the adhkar (dhikr) for morning and evening, and the adhkar for going to sleep, and others, this will have a great effect in protecting him from the evil eye, because it will be like a stronghold for him, by Allah’s leave. So everyone should strive to recite these adhkar. 
One of the best treatments is the use of ruqyah , which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) permitted for protection from the evil eye and he instructed people to use it. 
It was narrated that ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded me, or he commanded (the people) to use ruqyah to deal with the evil eye.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, al-Tibb, 5297) 
And it was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “The man who cast the evil eye would be commanded to do wudoo’, and then the man who was affected would wash himself with (the water).” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, al-Tibb, 3382. Al-Albani said, in Sahih Sunan Abi Dawud, its isnad is sahih. No. 3282) 
These are some of the du'as and treatments which offer protection – by Allah’s leave – from the evil eye and from destructive envy (hasad). We ask Allah to protect us from that. 
And Allah knows best.

11361,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11361,Is it permissible to take out insurance to cover funeral expenses?,We are small muslim community in London and in our last meeting our member pointed out that the funeral expenses are going up sharply and there is good chance that deceased family or the single person can not afford the expenses then in this case we should get insurance for funeral arrangements. Please advis urgently in this matter.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Insurance – which means paying a specific sum of money in return for something unknown is not permitted because it is like buying something sight unseen and is a form of deceit. But if the Muslims were to help one another, and those of means were to donate to others who do not have the means of paying for such things, this would be counted as co-operating in righteousness and piety which is enjoined in Islam. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Help you one another in Al Birr and At Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression”[al-Maa’idah 5:2]
 It should be noted that if a person is compelled to take out insurance and does so unwillingly, not by choice, then in this case there is no sin on him. .",Shaykh ‘Abd al-Kareem al-Khudayr

          has given man in this world that which will help him to worship and 
          obey Him as He has commanded. He has given him strength in himself and 
          has created him in the best mould (cf. al-Teen 95:4). Then He sent His 
          Messengers to mankind to tell them the way to worship and obey Him, 
          and He sent down His Books to mankind, and gave the ability to understand 
          and learn. 
The slave 
          has to seek the means which will help him to follow the path of obedience 
          and faith. These include: 
1 – Striving 
          to perform the obligatory duties as prescribed in sharee’ah, and doing 
          so regularly. 
2 – Striving 
          to keep away from haraam things and sin, because that has a great effect 
          on man’s heart. 
3 – Taking 
          time to read Qur’aan. What we should note here is that the kind of reading 
          Qur’aan which has a beneficial effect on the one who reads it is that 
          which is accompanied by thinking and pondering the meanings of the verses 
          of the Qur’aan. Allaah has told us of the effect of the Qur’aan on His 
          believing slaves, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and 
          when His Verses (this Qur’aan) are recited unto them, they (i.e. the 
          Verses) increase their Faith”[al-Anfaal 8:2] 
“Allaah 
          has sent down the Best Statement, a Book (this Qur’aan), its parts resembling 
          each other (in goodness and truth) (and) oft‑repeated. The skins 
          of those who fear their Lord shiver from it (when they recite it or 
          hear it). Then their skin and their heart soften to the remembrance 
          of Allaah”[al-Zumar 32:23]
4 – Remembering Allaah 
          (dhikr) and persisting in doing so. Beneficial dhikr is that which is 
          done in the heart and on the lips. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
          meaning): 
“verily, in the 
          remembrance of Allaah do hearts find rest”[al-Ra’d 13:28]
5 – Calling upon Allaah 
          (du’aa’) and turning to Him. Among the du’aa’s concerning this is that 
          which is described in the hadeeth of the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): 
“There 
          is no-one who is afflicted by distress and grief, and says: ‘Allaahumma 
          inni ‘abduka ibn ‘abdika ibn amatija naasyati bi yadika, maada fiyya 
          hukmuka, ‘adlun fiyya qadaa’uka. As’aluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta 
          bihi nafsaka aw anzaltahu fi kitaabika aw ‘allamtahu ahadan min khalqika 
          aw ista’tharta bihi fi ‘ilm il-ghayb ‘indaka an taj’al al-Qur’aana rabee’ 
          qalbi wa noor sadri wa jalaa’ huzni wa dhihaab hammi (O Allaah, 
          I am Your slave, son of Your slave, son of Your maidservant; my forelock 
          is in Your hand, Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree 
          over me is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You which You 
          have named Yourself with, or revealed in Your Book, or You taught to 
          any of Your creation, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the 
          Unseen with You, that You make the Qur’aan the life of my heart and 
          the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release 
          for my anxiety),’ but Allaah will take away his distress and grief, 
          and replace it with joy.” He was asked: “O Messenger of Allaah, should 
          we learn this?” He said: “Of course; everyone who hears it should learn 
          it.” 
6 – Striving to reduce 
          your attachment to this world and developing an attachment to the Hereafter, 
          for being preoccupied with the worries of this world makes a person 
          more worried and anxious, and makes the problems that he is going through 
          occupy all his thoughts and give him sleepless nights. 
7 – Doing 
          things to help one relax and dispel worry, such as keeping company with 
          righteous people, relaxing in permissible ways and giving oneself variety 
          to avoid a boring routine. 
If you 
          feel the need to visit a psychologist and consult him, there is nothing 
          wrong with that, so long as you beware of the deviant principles of

          is Kind to His slaves. He is Kind in His actions – He creates all created 
          beings in stages according to His wisdom and kindness, although He is 
          Able to create them all at once, in a single moment. Whoever studies 
          His laws and sees how they came step by step, will see that this bears 
          testimony to His kindness, may He be glorified. 
 Allaah 
          is Kind and He does not hasten, because the one who hastens is the one 
          who is afraid that he will miss something. But all things are under 
          His control and dominion, so he does not hasten.

          al-Qayyim said:

Qura'an & Sunna) on this issue so that we can submit this to the authorities of our Uni.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Your request should be for a mosque which 
          would be subject to all the rulings of the mosque, where you can hold 
          congregational prayers and it can be a centre for your da’wah activities. 
          In this case it would not be permissible for any rituals of kufr to 
          be held in this mosque, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
          
“And the mosques are for Allaah (Alone), so invoke not anyone along with Allaah”[al-Jinn 
          72:18].
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) forbade making announcements about lost property, or buying 
          and selling, in the mosque. He  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade praying towards 
          graves, because he  (peace and blessings

          He gives less priority to should be given less priority. He is the One

Al-taqdeem

the second part of my question is:

A name does not have any effect on a person's character, apart from reflecting optimism for him. On this basis, one should give one’s children good names and not give bad names. So we should use names like ‘Abd-Allaah (“slave of Allaah”), ‘Abd al-Rahmaan (“slave of the Most Merciful”), Muhammad, Ahmad, etc., and we should not use names which have bad meanings, such as Sa’b (difficult), etc.",Shaykh ‘Abd al-Kareem al-Khudayr
