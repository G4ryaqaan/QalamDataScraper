23402,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23402,Can he use medication which may cause his death to reduce pain?,"Two years ago I had a surgery to remove a tumor from my maxillary sinus. Since that time, I have continuous sinus and facial pain and I take pain medication. The pain did not subside after taking several medicines. Once or twice a week, I have to delay my farad salat by few hours when level of pain is high. Recently my physician has prescribed a medicine to reduce pain and according to him it has high risk of fatality, one in a thousand. My instinct tells me that taking this medicine is not acceptable, because if I die of it, it would be like committing suicide. Is taking a high risk medicine, which can kill a patient when his life is not in danger, acceptable in our religion?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    We ask Allaah to grant you healing and good health. 
It is not permissible for 
    the Muslim whom Allaah is testing with sickness to take something that will 
    definitely or will most likely harm him. He is commanded to protect his body 
    and it is not permissible for him to neglect the blessing of the physical 
    faculties that Allaah has bestowed upon him. How can he neglect himself? 

    One of the basic principles of Islamic sharee’ah is: “A 
    harmful thing cannot be removed by something like it (i.e., something else 
    that is also harmful).” Based on this, it is haraam to use as medicine 
    something that will cause greater harm than the disease itself. 

    See: Ahkaam al-Jaraahah al-Tibbiyyah, p. 124, by 
    Shaykh Dr. Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Mukhtaar al-Shanqeeti. 

    Patience in putting up with pain and seeking the reward of 
    Allaah are things that will benefit the Muslim in the Hereafter and increase 
    his reward.  

    It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri and Abu Hurayrah 
    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No 
    tiredness, exhaustion, worry, grief, distress or harm befalls a believer in 
    this world, not even a thorn that pricks him, but Allaah expiates some of 
    his sins thereby.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5318 and Muslim, 2573.  

    Read the story of this great women and how she was afflicted 
    by sickness – with all its pain – but she chose to bear it with patience in 
    return for the great reward, which is admittance to Paradise. 

    It was narrated that ‘Ata’ ibn Abi Rabaah said: Ibn ‘Abbaas 
    said to me: Shall I not show you a woman who is one of the people of 
    Paradise? He said: Yes. He said: This black woman came to the Prophet (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: “I suffer from epilepsy and I 
    become uncovered. Pray to Allaah for me.” He said: “If you wish, you can be 
    patient and Paradise will be yours, or if you wish I will pray to Allaah to 
    heal you.” She said, “I will be patient.” Then she said: “But I become 
    uncovered. Pray to Allaah that I will not become uncovered.” So he prayed 
    for her.

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5652; Muslim, 2576.  

    Some doctors have stated that taking tranquillizers may cause 
    a great deal of harm and lead to serious complications. 

    Some specialists have said that it is possible to reduce pain 
    through a nutritional program and an exercise regime, and other methods… You 
    should consult more than one doctor; perhaps with another specialist you 
    will find an answer that the one who told you to take that dangerous 
    medication does not know about. 

    But first and foremost, you have to be patient and accept the 
    decree of Allaah; make a lot of du’aa’ and ask Allaah for good health, for 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Who responds to the distressed one, when he calls on Him, 
    and Who removes the evil”

    [al-Naml 27:62]

    away your pain, and to decree reward for you, and to grant you wellbeing in 
    your spiritual and worldly affairs, and to protect you and take care of 
    you.

23415,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23415,Praying for Jinn Companion to Become Muslim,"Every individual among the sons of Adam has a jinn who has been appointed to be his constant companion (qareen). Ibn Mas'ood reports that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) says: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) says: There is not one of you who does not have a jinn appointed to be his constant companion. They said, and you too, O Messenger of Allah? He said, me too, but Allah has helped me and he has submitted, so that he only helps me to do good."" (Muslim)
Is it possible to pray for our jinn to become a Muslim?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The hadeeth (narration) you mention is a saheeh (authentic) hadeeth. It was narrated by Muslim, but there is a difference of scholarly opinion as to the meaning of the word “fa aslama” in this hadeeth. This dispute and the most correct view was mentioned by al-Nawawi in his commentary on this hadeeth. He said: 
With regard to the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “There is none of you who does not have a companion (qareen) appointed for him from among the jinn.” They said, “Even you?” He said, “Even me, but Allah helped me against him fa aslama [or fa aslamu], so he only tells me to do that which is good.” 
There are two well-known views that have been reported. Those who read the phrase as fa aslamu said that it means, “So I am safe [aslamu] from his evil and temptation.” Those who read it as fa aslama said that it means, “The qareen became Muslim [aslama] and became a believer, so he only tells me to do that which is good.” 
They differed as to which view is correct. Al-Khattabi said: The correct version is fa aslamu [so I am safe]. Al-Qadi ‘Iyad thought that fa aslama [so he became Muslim] was correct, and this is the preferred version, because he then said, “so he only tells me to do that which is good.” And they differed concerning the report that says fa aslama. It was said that it means he submitted in the sense of surrendering, and it appears in this form (fa astaslama – so he surrendered) in reports narrated elsewhere than in Saheeh Muslim. And it was said that it means that he became a Muslim and a believer. This is the apparent meaning. 
Abu Na’eem al-Asbahani said in Dalail al-Nubuwwah: It was said aslama meaning he believed. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was the only one whose qareen became a Muslim and a believer. 
Based on this, having one’s qareen become a Muslim was something that was unique to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
So it is not prescribed for the Muslim to pray that his qareen become Muslim, because this is overstepping the limits in du’a (supplication) by asking Allah for something that belongs only to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and because there is no report that the sahabah (companions), who were the keenest of all people to do good and the closest to it, asked Allah to make their qareens become Muslim, and they did not ask the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to pray for that for them when they heard this hadeeth from him. There is no report that Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthman and ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with them), who were very keen to do good, or their sons, did that. We have to follow the guidance of these great sahabah because they understood this religion properly and learned it directly from its source, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and it is not permissible for us to follow any path but theirs. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers’ way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell — what an evil destination!” [4:115] 
This hadeeth was narrated in the context of warning the sahabah against the fitnah (trials) of the qareen. Al-Nawawi said: This hadeeth is a warning against the fitnah of the qareen and his whispers and temptation. [The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] warned us against him so that we can be as cautious as possible. This is what we must do, according to sharee’ah (Islamic law). 
It is sufficient for us to recite the du’as that Allah has taught us, for example: 
“And say: ‘My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings (suggestions) of the shayateen (devils).
And I seek refuge with You, My Lord! Lest they should come near me.’” [23:97-98 – interpretation of the meaning] 
And you should recite Surat al-Ikhlas and the Mu’awwadhatayn (the last two surahs of the Quran) morning and evening, as well as the dhikrs (words of remembrance) narrated in saheeh ahadeeth (authentic narrations) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). You should also recite ayat al-Kursiy before going to sleep, and Bismillahi al-Rahmani al-Raheem before doing anything, and you should seek refuge with Allah every time you notice the whispers of the shaytan. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if an evil whisper from shaytan  tries to turn you away (O Muhammad) (from doing good), then seek refuge in Allah. Verily, He is the All‑Hearer, the All‑Knower.” [41:36] 
I ask Allah to make you more keen to do good and to protect us and you from the shaytan and his whisperings. Ameen.",Islam Q&A
23420,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23420,Love Marriage or Arranged Marriage: Which Is Better in Islam?,"What is more stable in Islam, a love marriage or an arranged marriage?","If love between two parties did not transgress the limits set by Allah or make them commit sin, then there is the hope that this love marriage will be more stable. For more about love marriages and arranged marriages in Islam, see the detailed answer.","What does Islam say about love marriages?


What does Islam say about arranged marriages?","Praise be to Allah.What does Islam say about love marriages?
The issue of love marriage s depends on the ruling on what came before it. If the love between the two parties did not transgress the limits set by Allah or make them commit sin, then there is the hope that the marriage which results from this love will be more stable, because it came about as the result of the fact that each of them wanted to marry the other. 
If a man feels some attraction towards a woman whom it is permissible for him to marry, and vice versa, there is no answer to the problem except marriage . The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “We do not think that there is anything better for those who love one another than marriage.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 1847; classed as sahih by al-Busayri and by Shaykh al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Sahihah, 624) 
Al-Sindi said, as noted in Hamish Sunan Ibn Majah: 
The phrase “We do not think that there is anything better for those who love one another than marriage” may be understood to refer to two or to more than two. What this means is that if there is love between two people, that love cannot be increased or made to last longer by anything like marriage. If there is marriage as well as that love, that love will increase and grow stronger every day.” 
But if that marriage comes about as a result of an illicit love relationship, such as when they meet and are alone together and kiss one another, and other haraam actions, then it will never be stable, because they committed actions that go against sharee’ah Sharee’ah and because they have built their lives on things that will have the effect of reducing blessings and support from Allaah, for sin is a major factor in reducing blessings, even though some people think, because of the Shaytaan’s whispers, that falling in love and doing haraam deeds makes marriage stronger.  
Moreover, these illicit relationships that take place before marriage will be a cause to make each party doubtful about the other. The husband will think that his wife may possibly have a similar relationship with someone else, and even if he thinks it unlikely, he will still be troubled by the fact that his wife did do something wrong with him. And the same thoughts may occur to the wife too, and she will think that her husband could possibly have an affair with another woman, and even if she thinks it unlikely, she will still be troubled by the fact that her husband did something wrong with her. 
So each partner will live in a state of doubt and suspicion, which will ruin their relationship sooner or later. 
The husband may condemn his wife for having agreed to have a relationship with him before marriage, which will be upsetting for her, and this will cause their relationship to deteriorate. 
Hence we think that if a marriage is based upon an illicit premarital relationship, it will most likely be unstable and will not be successful. 
What does Islam say about arranged marriages?
With regard to arranged marriages where the family chooses the partner, they are not all good and not all bad. If the family makes a good choice and the woman is religious and beautiful, and the husband likes her and wants to marry her, then there is the hope that their marriage will be stable and successful. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) urged the one who wants to get married to look at the woman. It was narrated from al-Mugheerah ibn Shu’bah that he proposed marriage to a woman, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Go and look at her, because that is more likely to create love between you.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1087; classed as hasan by al-Nasaa’i, 3235) 
But if the family makes a bad choice, or they make a good choice but the husband does not agree with it, then this marriage is most likely doomed to failure and instability, because the marriage that is based on lack of interest usually is not stable.

23423,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23423,Should be denounce one whom he saw eating by mistake in Ramadan?,"Some people say that if you see a Muslim drinking or eating out of forgetfulness during the day in Ramadan, you do not have to tell him, because Allah has fed him and given him to drink as it says in the hadith. Is this correct?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Whoever sees a Muslim drinking or eating during the day in Ramadan, or doing anything else that breaks the fast, has to tell him off, because doing that openly during the day in Ramadan is wrong. Even if a person has an excuse for doing that, (he should not do it), lest people dare to do openly things that Allah has forbidden, i.e., openly doing things that break the fast during the day in Ramadan, claiming that they have forgotten that they are fasting. If the one who does that openly is sincere in his claim to have forgotten, then he does not have to make up the fast, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever forgets that he is fasting and eats or drinks, let him complete his fast, for the One Who fed him and gave him to drink was Allah.” (Saheeh, agreed upon). Similarly, the traveler should not eat or drink openly among residents who do not know that he is a traveler, rather he should do that in secret so that they will not accuse him of doing something that Allah has forbidden and so that he will not encourage anyone else to dare to do that. And similarly, the kuffaar should be prevented from openly eating or drinking etc. among the Muslims, so as to prevent anyone taking this matter lightly and because they are not allowed to practise their false religion openly among the Muslims.

23425,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23425,Sin and its Effects on the One Who Commits it,"I did Hajj for myself, and a few months after Hajj I still had not seen any sign that my Hajj was accepted in the sense that I turned to worship more. On the contrary, I committed a lot of sins. Last year I resolved to do Hajj on behalf of my mother who has passed away. I asked one of the shaykhs (scholars) and he said that I should do Hajj on her behalf as I had intended, and I should pray a lot for forgiveness and beseech Allah. So I did Hajj on behalf of my mother, traveling with one of the groups. During Tawaaf al-Wadaa’ (farewell cicumumbulation), the overcrowding was very severe, so we did one circuit (of Tawaaf) and part of another circuit, then we went up to the roof, because of the severe overcrowding. Because of the overcrowding we were not quite sure of the exact spot where we had stopped on the lower level, but we did our best to make sure that we started our Tawaaf on the roof from the place where we had stopped on the lower level, and we continued with our Tawaaf until it was completed.
After my last Hajj, if I committed any sin – and I did many of them – I felt some tightness and constriction in my chest, and if I did any act of worship or obedience I felt happy and full of sincere feelings towards Islam and its people at this time… I am worried about the two pilgrimages and about the Tawaaf. Please advise me, may Allah reward you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: we advise you to keep away from all sin, minor and major, and to beware of it and avoid it, for sin is bad news for the one who does it. We will quote here some of the effects of sin, as described by Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him): 
1 – Being deprived of knowledge for knowledge is light that Allah causes to reach the heart, and sin extinguishes that light. When al-Shaafa’i sat before Maalik and read to him, he admired him because of the intelligence, alertness and understanding that he saw in him. He said, “I think that Allah has caused light to enter your heart, so do not extinguish it with the darkness of sin.”
 2 – Being deprived of provision. In Musnad Ahmad it is narrated that Thawbaan said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘A man is deprived of provision because of the sins that he commits.’” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 4022, classed as hasan/sound by al-Albani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah). 
3 – Sense of alienation that comes between a person and his Lord, and between him and other people. One of the salaf (righteous predecessors) said: “If I disobey Allah, I see that in the attitude of my riding beast and my wife.” 
4 – Things become difficult for him, so that he does not turn his attention towards any matter but he finds the way blocked or he finds it difficult. By the same token, for the one who fears Allah, things are made easy for him. 
5 – The sinner will find darkness in his heart, which he will feel just as he feels the darkness of night. So this darkness affects his heart as the physical darkness affects his vision. For obedience is light and disobedience is darkness. The stronger the darkness grows, the greater becomes his confusion, until he falls into innovation, misguidance and other things that lead to doom, without even realizing, like a blind man who goes out in the darkness of the night, walking alone This darkness grows stronger until it covers the eyes, then it grows stronger until it covers the face, which appears dark and is seen by everyone. ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abbaas said: “Good deeds make the face light, give light to the heart, and bring about ample provision, physical strength and love in people’s hearts. Bad deeds make the face dark, give darkness to the heart, and bring about physical weakness, a lack of provision and hatred in people’s hearts.” 
6 – Deprivation of worship and obedience. If sin brought no punishment other than that it prevents a person from doing an act of worship which is the opposite of sin, and cuts off access to other acts of worship, that would be bad enough. So the sin cuts off a third way and a fourth way and so on, and because of the sin he is cut off from many acts of worship, each of which would have been better for him than this world and everything in it. So he is like a man who eats food that is bound to cause a lengthy sickness, and thus he is deprived of many other foods that are better than that. And Allah is the One Whose help we seek. 
7 – Sin breeds sin until it dominates a person and he cannot escape from it. 
8 – Sin weakens a person’s willpower. It gradually strengthens his will to commit sin and weakens his will to repent until there is no will in his heart to repent at all… so he seeks forgiveness and expresses repentance, but it is merely words on the lips, like the repentance of the liars, whose hearts are still determined to commit sin and persist in it. This is one of the most serious diseases that are most likely to lead to doom. 
9 – He will become desensitized and will no longer find sin abhorrent, so it will become his habit, and he will not be bothered if people see him committing the sin or talk about him. 
For the leaders of immorality, this is the ultimate shamelessness in which they find great pleasure, such that they feel proud of their sin and will speak of it to people who do not know that they have done it, saying, “O so and so, I did such and such.” Such people cannot be helped and the path to repentance is blocked for them in most cases. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “All of my ummah (followers) will be fine except for those who commit sin openly, and that includes cases where Allah conceals a person’s sin, but the following morning he exposes himself and says, ‘O So and so, I did such and such last night, so he shamelessly exposes himself when all night his Lord had concealed his sin.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5949; Muslim, 2744). 
10 – When there are many sins they leave a mark on the heart of the person who commits them, so he becomes one of the negligent. As one of the salaf said, concerning the aayah (verse)– 
“Nay! But on their hearts is the Raan (covering of sins and evil deeds) which they used to earn”
[al-Mutaffifeen 83:14 – interpretation of the meaning] – 
this means sin after sin. 
How this starts is that the heart gets stained by sin, and if the sin increases then the stain grows bigger until it becomes the raan (covering of sin and evil deeds), then it increases until it becomes a seal, and the heart becomes covered and sealed. If that happens after a person had been guided and had understood, then his heart is turned upside down, and at that point the Shaytaan gains control over him and directs him as he wants. 
Secondly: you say that you did Hajj and did not see any signs of acceptance, rather you committed a lot of sins. The answer to this is that acceptance is from Allah, and no one can be certain whether your deed has been accepted or not. 
The believer does righteous deeds and does not know whether Allah has accepted them or not. 
Indeed, Ibn ‘Umar said: “If I knew that Allah had accepted even one good deed from me, death would be the most dear thing to me, because Allah says, ‘Verily, Allah accepts only from those who are al-Muttaaqoon (the pious)’ [al-Maa’idah 5:27 – interpretation of the meaning].” 
Man is required to do a great deal of righteous deeds, and to strive to make sure his actions are in accordance with the commands of Allah and His Messenger. In this manner he will free himself from any blame, then he must ask Allah to accept his deeds. 
So if you did you Hajj properly and avoided everything that is forbidden during Hajj, then you do not have to repeat it. As for your falling into sin, that has nothing to do with the validity or otherwise of your Hajj, but you will be brought to account for it, so you must hasten to repent from it before your appointed time (of death) comes. 
Thirdly: you say that you did Tawaaf then went up to the roof because of the overcrowding. 
This is the issue of continuity in Tawaaf. The Standing Committee was asked a similar question and replied that there is nothing wrong with interrupting Tawaaf and completing it on a higher level (of the mosque). See Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 11/230, 231, 232. 
With regard to the start of Tawaaf, it should begin in the same place where it ends. With regard to your efforts to figure out the place, if it is not possible to be certain then you should act according to what is most likely to be correct, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, concerning one who is uncertain as to whether he has prayed three rak’ahs or four, “Let him try his best (to work it out), then complete it on that basis – i.e., he should base it on what he thinks is the case – then let him say the salaams (two salutations at the end of the prayer, one to the right and one to the left)and do two prostrations after he says the salaams.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 401; Muslim, 572; see also al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 3/461). 
Based on the above, then your completing your tawaaf on the roof and your striving to start from the place from which you interrupted your tawaaf are both fine in sha Allah.

May Allaah reward you and make your efforts weigh heavily in the balance of your good deeds.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The correct scholarly view is that whatever the latecomer who joins the prayer with the imam catches up with is the first part of his prayer. This is the view of al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him), see al-Majmoo’ by al-Nawawi, 4/420. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If you hear the iqaamah then walk to the prayer, and you must be calm and dignified, and do not hasten. Whatever you catch up with, pray, and whatever you miss, make it up.” (al-Bukhaari, 636; Muslim, 602). This is what is meant by whatever the latecomer who joins the prayer with the imam catches up with being the first part of his prayer. 
On this basis, if the latecomer joins the imam in the second rak’ah of Maghrib prayer, then this rak’ah is the second for the imam and the first for this person who is praying behind him, then the third rak’ah for the imam is the second rak’ah for the person praying behind him.

23429,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23429,Observing Voluntary Fasts before Making Up Missed Fasts,What is the ruling on observing voluntary fasts before making up obligatory fasts from Ramadan?,"Some scholars view that so long as there is sufficient time to make up missed fasts, it is permissible to observe optional fasts.",,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed concerning the ruling on observing voluntary fasts before making up missed fasts .
Some scholars were of the view that “it is not correct to observe voluntary fasts before making up missed fasts , and that the one who does that is a sinner.” The reason they gave for that was that an optional (non-obligatory) action should not be done before an obligatory action.
Other scholars, on the other hand, said that it is permissible so long as time is not short. They said: So long as there is sufficient time, it is permissible to observe optional fasts , just as one may perform optional prayers before praying (an obligatory prayer). For example, the time of Dhuhr starts after the sun reaches its zenith and ends when the shadow of an object is equal in length to its length, so one may delay Dhuhr to the end of its time, and during this period it is permissible to offer optional prayers, because there is sufficient time.
This is the view of the majority of jurists, and was the view favoured by Ash-Shaykh Muhammad ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) who said: “This is the most correct view, and his fast is valid and he is not a sinner, because this is a clear analogy… And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“…and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days.” [Al-Baqarah 2:185]
This means that he has to make up (the missed fasts) on other days, but Allah did not stipulate that they must be consecutive days; if He had stipulated that, then they would have had to be made up immediately. This indicates that there is some room for manoeuvre in this matter.”

Prior to excepting his new Faith he was sexually active with his girlfriend. After excepting his new Faith he would masterbate to relieve him of his sexual tensions. I advised him that masturbating was forbidden as well. Now he is engaged to be married in a couple of years and him and his Fiance have sex and masterbate for each other. The reason for the delay in the marriage is that they are financially unstable at this point. He wants to know if masterbation and intercourse is permisble under these circumstances and if they are not what can he do to remedy this?,,,"Praise be to Allah.We praise Allaah for having blessed your friend and guided him to Islam, as we ask Allaah to make him steadfast in adhering to it until death. He has succeeded in attaining the greatest achievement in life, which is coming forth from the darkness of kufr and shirk to the light of Islam and guidance, and the worship of Allaah alone with no partner or associate. Whatever blameworthy former customs are left, it will be easy for him to give them up in sha Allaah, if he seeks the help of Allaah, because whoever gives up the religion that he grew up in and enters the true religion, it will become easy for him to give up the habits that he was accustomed to during his jaahiliyyah. The secret habit (i.e. masturbation) is a disease which harms the one who does it. See question no. 329, 12277. 
So he has to give up this bad habit and follow the advice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who said, “ Young men, whoever among you can afford to get married, let him do so, for it is more effective in lowering one’s gaze and guarding one’s chastity. Whoever cannot afford that, then let him fast, for it will be a shield for him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5065; Muslim, 1400). 
With regard to his question about having sex with his fiancée – if what he means by fiancée is the woman with whom he has made a marriage contract according to sharee’ah, then whatever sexual activities he does with her are correct, good and halaal. But if he is referring to a woman to whom he has proposed marriage but has not yet made a marriage contract, then what they are doing is haraam and is a kind of zina (fornication or adultery) and evil action, and both of them have exposed themselves to the wrath and punishment of Allaah. 
The fact that he is financially unable to get married does not justify doing the things that he has done with his fiancée, if he had not made a proper marriage contract with her. It should be noted that the fiancée is considered to be a stranger (non-mahram) to the fiancé, like any other non-mahram woman, so it is not permissible for him to be alone with her, or for her to masturbate him with her hand, or for him to kiss her, or for him to speak to her unless that is for a specific purpose and from behind a screen and without any feelings of desire. See question no. 8994. 
The solution in this case is for him to do the marriage contract with her, because if he does the marriage contract with a woman it is then permissible for him to do everything with her, as she has now become his wife, even if the wedding party has not yet taken place. See question no. 13886. 
It is also permissible for a husband to be masturbated by his wife’s hand. See question no. 826.

    It is permissible for a man to marry the ex-wife of his 
    wife’s father, so long as that is not his wife’s mother. There is nothing 
    wrong with marrying her even if her husband’s daughter is with him (is his 
    wife), because there is no blood relationship between the two wives, i.e., 
    between his first wife and her father’s ex-wife. What is forbidden is to be 
    married to two sisters at the same time, or to be married to a woman and her 
    maternal aunt or a woman and her paternal aunt at the same time. See 
    question no. 22302. Anything other than that is 
    permissible, because Allaah says, after mentioning those women whom one is 
    forbidden to marry: 
“All others are lawful, 
    provided you seek (them in marriage) with Mahr (bridal-money given by the 
    husband to his wife at the time of marriage) from your property”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:24 – interpretation of the meaning]

    With regard to a mother and daughter: if the daughter is the 
    wife, then then her mother becomes permanently forbidden for him to marry as 
    soon as the marriage contract is completed. 

    If the mother is the wife, then the matter is subject to 
    further discussion: 

    -If her husband consummated the 
    marriage (i.e., has had intercourse with her), then the daughter is 
    permanently forbidden for him.

    -If he has not consummated the 
    marriage, then the daughter is forbidden for him until he divorces the 
    mother, because Allaah says, describing the women who are forbidden for 
    marriage:

    “your wives’ mothers, your stepdaughters under your 
    guardianship, born of your wives to whom you have gone in — but there is no 
    sin on you if you have not gone in them (to marry their daughters),”

    With regard to giving the adhaan via loudspeakers, there is 
    nothing wrong with that because it is a means of making the adhaan reach the 
    listeners, and the means come under the same rulings as the ends. It is 
    required for the muezzin to raise his voice so that the people can hear him, 
    so whatever is a means to this end is also required.

    All of that and other things are included in the commands to

    Similarly, making voices and useful opinions reach distant 
    places by means of telegraphs, telephones, etc. is included in the command 
    of Allaah and His Messenger to convey the truth to mankind. The ability to 
    convey the truth and beneficial words through a variety of means is a 
    blessing from Allaah, and developing and inventing means that serve both

    Guidance to the religion of Islam is a great blessing, and 
    the one who is the cause of a person being guided will have a great reward. 
    It was narrated from Sahl ibn Sa’d (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he 
    heard the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say to 
    ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib: “By Allaah, if one man were to be guided at your hands, 
    it would be better for you than red camels [i.e., the most valuable kind].” 
    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2942 and Muslim, 2404). 

    So you must do your utmost to guide your wife to Islam 
    because of the great good there is in that for you, for her and for your 
    children. 

    With regard to her situation after becoming Muslim, this is a 
    matter that rests with Allaah, because you do not know what will happen to 
    you, will you remain steadfast in Islam or not? For people’s hearts are 
    between two of the fingers of the Most Merciful and He turns them as He 
    wills, so how about someone else? It was narrated from Anas ibn Maalik that 
    the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    used to say often: “O Controller of the hearts, make my heart steadfast in 
    adhering to Your religion.” I [Anas] said: “O Messenger of Allaah, we 
    believe in you and that which you have brought, do you still fear for us?” 
    He said, “Yes, for people’s hearts are between two of the fingers of the 
    Most Merciful and He turns them as He wills.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi 
    (2140); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2792). 

    We remind you that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) used to like to look on the bright side. It was narrated 
    from Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “(There is) no ‘Adwa (no 
    contagious disease is conveyed without Allaah's permission), nor is there 
    any tiyarah (bad omen from birds). I like fa’l (optimism).” They asked, 
    “What is fa’l?” He said, ""A good word that one of you hears (and takes as a 
    good omen).” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5776; Muslim, 2224). So be optimistic 
    that she will remain in Islam. What you have to do now is to strive to guide 
    her. 
If your wife becomes Muslim then apostatizes, 
    then in this case it is obligatory to leave her and it is not permissible to 
    stay with her unless she comes back to Islam. We ask Allaah to end our lives

With regard to those in which the shape is 
    incomplete, in which there is only a part of the limbs or head, but the shape is not clear, there is no doubt that these are permissible, and

But if the shape is complete, and it is as if 
    you are looking at a person – especially if it can move or speak – then I am not entirely at ease with the idea of them being permissible, because 
    this is a complete imitation of the creation of Allaah. It seems that the dolls with which ‘Aa’ishah used to play were not like this, so it is 
    preferable to avoid them. But I cannot say that they are definitely haraam, because there are concessions granted to young children that are not 
    granted to adults in such matters. It is natural for young children to play and have fun, they are not obliged to do any of the acts of worship so 
    we cannot say that that they are wasting their time in idle play. But if a person wants to be on the safe side in such matters, he should cut off

23463,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23463,Man writing romantic letters to his former wife,Is it halal or haram for a person to write or call former spouse in romantic way after that person is remarried and also is it approprieate to keep former spouse's cards and pictures in the bedroom where newly married couple resides?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    After a woman has been divorced and her ‘iddah is finished, 
    she becomes a “stranger” (i.e., non-mahram) to her former husband, so it is 
    not permissible for him to correspond with her or talk to her or shake hands 
    with her or be alone with her. Such actions on his part or on hers pave the 
    way for immorality, let alone being haraam in and of themselves. 

    1 – Shaykh Muhammad Saalih ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 

    It is not permissible for any person to correspond with a 
    woman who is not his mahram, because of the fitnah (temptation) involved in 
    that.  The person who is sending these letters may think that there is no 
    fitnah involved, but the Shaytaan will keep at him until he tempts the man 
    by means of the woman and vice versa. 

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    commanded those who hear the Dajjaal to keep away from him, and he said that 
    a man may come to him as a believer, but the Dajjaal will keep at him until 
    he tempts him and leads him astray. 
There is a great deal of 
    temptation and danger in correspondence between young men and young women, 
    so they must keep away from it, even  though the questioner may say that 
    there is no love involved. 

    Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 
    2/578 

    2 – Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah al-Jibreen said, when he was asked 
    about corresponding with a non-mahram woman: 

    This action is not permissible, because it will provoke 
    desire between them and will make them want to meet one another. This kind 
    of correspondence often causes fitnah (temptation) and plants the seeds of 
    zina in the heart, which leads to evil actions. So we advise those who are 
    seeking that which is in their own best interests and who wish to protect 
    themselves to avoid writing to or speaking with non-mahrams, etc., so as to 
    protect their religious commitment and their honour, and Allaah is the 
    Source of help. 

    Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 
    2/578, 579 

    Secondly: 
It is not permissible 
    for a husband or a wife to keep pictures of one another after the ‘iddah 
    following talaaq has ended, because they have become strangers (i.e. 
    non-mahrams) to one another and Allaah has forbidden them to look at one 
    another. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking 
    at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual 
    acts). That is purer for them. Verily, Allaah is All‑Aware of what they do.
And tell the believing 
    women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect 
    their private parts (from illegal sexual acts)”

    [al-Noor 24:30-31]

    Moreover, for the husband to keep pictures of his former wife 
    in the bedroom of his new wife is contrary to good treatment of the new 
    wife, and it will generate jealousy and hatred towards the first wife, and 
    rancour and hatred towards her husband. 

    Hence it is not permissible for the husband to keep pictures 
    of his former wife or to correspond with her. 

    If the divorce is not the third and final talaaq, in which 
    the husband is not permitted to take back his wife until after she has been 
    married to another husband, and if the husband thinks that the reasons for 
    the divorce no longer apply and that they can adhere to the limits set by 
    Allaah and that each of them will be able to treat the other properly, then 
    in such a case he can take her back with a new marriage contract so that she 
    will be his wife again, especially if he has children from her whom he fears 
    may be adversely affected by their parents’ separation. 

    Marriage to another woman does not mean that he cannot 
    re-marry the divorced wife if he thinks that he is able to take care of 
    both.

Going to these beaches is haraam because of the uncovering of ‘awrahs and careless mixing between men and women that happen there. 
Moreover these places are filled with evil things, so it is not permissible for you to go there, unless you are going to enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand [by taking action]; if he cannot, then with his tongue [by speaking out]; if he cannot, then with his heart [by hating it and feeling that it is wrong] – and that is the weakest of faith.”
(Narrated by Muslim, 49) 
If you stay with them without enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, then you are partaking in sin with them. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And it has already been revealed to you in the Book (this Qur’aan) that when you hear the Verses of Allah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them. Surely, Allaah will collect the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell” [al-Nisa’ 4:140]
This verse indicates that whoever sits in a sinful gathering and does not denounce them shares the burden of sin equally with them. He should denounce them if they engage in sinful talk or sinful actions. If he is unable to denounce them then he should get up and leave them.  
(Tafseer al-Qaasimi, 5/526) 
Do not let the Shaytaan deceive you and make you say that you will not pay any attention to what other people are wearing. This is the deception of the Shaytaan, because if a person goes (to such places) his gaze will inevitably fall upon something that makes his Lord angry. A man may look at something unintentionally, but the Shaytaan can use this glance to great effect and make it the means that leads to fitnah, Allah forbid. I ask Allah to grant us and you refuge from being led astray by fitnah, and to make us steadfast.

Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar said:

    of years. 

    Allaah said: 

    “The Romans have been defeated.

    In the nearest land (Syria, Iraq, Jordan, and Palestine), 
    and they, after their defeat, will be victorious.

    Within three to nine years. The decision of the matter,

    The scholars of Tafseer said: the Persians defeated the 
    Romans, and the kuffaar of Makkah rejoiced because of that and said, “Those 
    who do not have a Book have defeated those who do have a Book,” and they 
    gloated over the Muslims and said, “We will also defeat you as the Persians 
    defeated the Romans.” The Muslims wanted the Romans to prevail over the 
    Persians because they were People of the Book… “and they, after their 
    defeat, will be victorious” means that the Romans, after having been 
    defeated by the Persians, would defeat the people of Persia.

    sent to them. So We planted amongst them enmity and hatred till the Day of 
    Resurrection (when they discarded Allaah’s Book, disobeyed Allaah’s 
    Messengers and His Orders and transgressed beyond bounds in Allaah’s 
    disobedience); and Allaah will inform them of what they used to do”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:14]

    Ibn Katheer said: 

    “So We planted amongst them enmity and hatred till the Day 
    of Resurrection” means, We sowed amongst them enmity and hatred of one 
    another, and they will remain like that until the Hour begins. Hence the 
    Christian groups, no matter what their types, will continue to hate one 
    another and denounce one another as disbelievers and curse one another. So 
    each group forbids the others to come to its place of worship, and the 
    Byzantines denounced the Jacobites as disbelievers, and the Nestorians 
    denounced the Arians, and so on. Each group denounces the others as 
    disbelievers in this world and will do so on the Day of Judgement.

    very truth, not fearing the mushrikeen, some of them having their heads 
    shaved and some of them with their hair cut short.

    5 – The battle of Badr 

    Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And (remember) when Allaah promised you (Muslims) one of 
    the two parties (of the enemy, i.e. either the army or the caravan) that it 
    should be yours; you wished that the one not armed (the caravan) should be 
    yours, but Allaah willed to justify the truth by His Words and to cut off 
    the roots of the disbelievers (i.e. in the battle of Badr)”

    [al-Anfaal 8:7]

    Ibn al-Jawzi said: 

    What this means is: Remember when Allaah promised you one of 
    the two parties. The two parties were: Abu Sufyaan and the wealth that was 
    with him, and Abu Jahl and the people of Quraysh who were with him. When Abu 
    Sufyaan went ahead with the wealth that was with him, he wrote to Quraysh 
    saying, if you have already gone out to save your caravan, I have already 
    saved it for you (i.e., so go back). Abu Jahl said, By Allaah, we will not 
    go back. Then the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) set out, heading for the people (i.e., to confront the kaafir 
    army), but his companions were not happy about that, wishing that they had 
    caught up with the group from whom they could capture the booty without 
    fighting. Hence Allaah said “you wished that the one not armed (the 
    caravan) should be yours”.

     And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
23481,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23481,The distress of a wife whose husband is active in da’wah and does not have time for her,"I got married to a person who is religiously committed, praise be to Allaah, and my condition (in the marriage contract) was that I complete my study of sharee’ah. My husband agreed to that, but after we got married he began to tell me that the Islamic University in America is not recognized. (This does not bother me so long as it is teaching knowledge of sharee’ah). But he does not want to spend his money unless it is a recognized Arabic university. Now after four years I will be going home in sha Allaah, but I have resolved not to go with him until I have completed my sharee’ah studies or at least completed my diploma in the study of the Holy Qur’aan, in sha Allaah. 

What advice can you give to me and to my husband? I want him to read this letter, noting that my husband does not have sufficient time for me to sit with him and read Islamic books. 

My husband is very active in da’wah outside the home, but inside the home he is not like that. He sits in his den at home and locks the door, and he tells me that the people’s interests are more important than the family’s interests, but it should be noted that I need him to take the children away from me and take care of them because I become sick (praise be to Allaah in all situations). I ask Allaah Almighty, the Lord of the Mighty Throne, to heal me. 

It has reached the stage where I now hate him for his shortcomings, for he spends all his time in meetings in the mosque. At the beginning of our marriage, four years ago, I was trying to memorize Qur’aan but he did not help me with that and he would never listen to my recitation. I tried to read Qur’aan to him, but he could not do that because he is busy with meetings and other things. He relaxes at home for fifteen to thirty minutes, but it should be noted that he has set aside one day to stay at home, following heated arguments between him and me. All the time I sit alone with my children and he has never appreciated that, to the point that I am fed up with him and the society in which I live. I turned to Allaah and I do not complain to my family; in fact I praise my husband in front of them, hoping that Allaah will change him and make him pay attention to his family. Note that I am living overseas far away from my family and brothers. He also has another fault: if I ask him for money to buy what I need, he tells me that he does not have money, but I know that he is spending on his family and brothers. I am not telling him not to spend on his parents, rather he has the duty to spend on them. But he is very stingy towards me and my children. I want him to give me a monthly allowance for me and my children – is this permissible? I hope that you can advise me on this, for I am tired of asking him. I hope that you can advise us and him.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    We ask Allaah to relieve your distress, make things easy for 
    you, console you in your loneliness, guide your husband and heal you of your 
    sickness… Ameen. 

    Your question includes a number of matters, both issues of 
    fiqh and social problems… Perhaps it is best if we look at each problem by 
    itself so as to reach a useful solution. 

    The first problem is that your 
    husband seems to have reneged on fulfilling the condition which he agreed to 
    when he married you, which was that you should complete your studies. It is 
    not permissible (for him to renege on the conditions of the marriage 
    contract), because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “The conditions which are most deserving of being fulfilled are 
    those by which it becomes permissible for you to engage in intimacy” 
    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2721; Muslim, 1418), i.e., the conditions of the 
    marriage contract which are stipulated by the woman or her guardian; but it 
    should be noted that these conditions should not go against the Book of 
    Allaah. 

    So your husband must fulfil this condition, and not prevent 
    you from studying. 

    With regard to the costs of study and the choice of a 
    university, reference should be made to the details of the condition; if you 
    did stipulate the condition that he has to pay your fees or let you study at 
    a particular university, then he has to honour that. If you did not 
    stipulate these details, then he is only obliged to let you 
    study.                        

    With regard to your intention to stay there and not travel 
    with your husband, if you will be staying in a safe place then it is 
    permissible for you to do that, otherwise it is not. All of this depends on 
    your study being acceptable by Islamic standards, but if it involves mixing 
    of men and women or other objectionable matters as happens in many 
    universities, then it is not permissible for you to study there or for your 
    husband to honour this condition at all. 

    The second problem is that he 
    does not have enough time to sit with you. 

    The answer to this problem is that he can find time, but it 
    needs sound planning, a revision of priorities and an understanding of 
    rights and duties. 

    We remind you that your husband’s being busy with righteous 
    deeds is a blessing; perhaps you might give him a break and praise Allaah 
    that he is not busy with sinful things as is the case for many wives who are 
    suffering because their husbands neglect their families and are preoccupied 
    with sinful 
    activities.                                                                                                     
    

    It seems that your husband does not fully understand the 
    priorities of the Islamic sharee’ah, and that there is a lack of balance in 
    his approach to Islamic duties. Perhaps one aspect of the religion has 
    distracted him from another aspect. He should be reminded of the aayah in 
    which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families 
    against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones”

    [al-Tahreem 66:6]
And the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Your family has rights 
    over you.” 

    He should also pay attention to the order in which Islam 
    tells us to direct our da’wah efforts, so he should start with himself, then 
    his wife and children, then all his relatives, the closer ones before the 
    more distant ones. It is important for you to make him realize that you are 
    not opposed to his da’wah efforts and that you are not an obstacle in the 
    way of his striving for the sake of Allaah, but you want the rights that 
    Islam gives you. 

    Tell him to make you one of the targets of his da’wah, one of 
    the people whom he pays attention to and follows their progress. Tell him to 
    make his children one of his da’wah projects that he undertakes. For more 
    information see question no. 6913. 

    After this problem is resolved, we are sure – in sha Allaah – 
    that the third problem will be resolved, which is your feelings of 
    hatred towards your husband as a result of his bad treatment of you, because 
    this feeling is simply a reaction to his neglect of you, and when the cause, 
    his neglect of your rights, is no longer there it will disappear. At the 
    same time, make lots of du’aa’ asking Allaah to open his heart to you and 
    your heart to him, because the Shaytaan is keen to cause division between a 
    man and his wife, and the hatred that exists in your heart is no more than 
    the promptings of the Shaytaan, so seek refuge with Allaah from his evil. 

    The fourth problem:

    The husband is not fulfilling his obligations towards his 
    wife and children, and instead he is spending on his parents. 

    This action on the husband’s part involves both right and 
    wrong. What he is doing right is spending on his parents and siblings, but 
    where he is going wrong is his neglect of spending on his wife. This is 
    going against his duty, because a man’s duty is to give his wife precedence 
    over his brothers when it comes to spending, because of the report narrated 
    by Abu Dawood in his Sunan (1691) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) who said: “The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) enjoined charity. A man said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, I have a 
    dinar.’ He said, ‘Spend it in charity on yourself.’ He said, ‘I have 
    another.’ He said, ‘Spend it in charity on your child.’ He said, ‘I have 
    another.’ He said, ‘Spend it in charity on your wife.’ He said, ‘I have 
    another.’ He said, ‘Spend it in charity on your servant.’ He said, ‘I have 
    another.’ He said, ‘You know best (where to spend it).” (Classed as hasan by 
    al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan Abi Dawood, 1483). 

    If your husband persists in not spending on you and your 
    needs, then you have the right to take from his wealth what is sufficient 
    for you and your children, even if you do that without his permission, 
    without being extravagant or causing mischief, because of the hadeeth of 
    ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), who said that Hind bint ‘Utbah 
    said, “O Messenger of Allaah, Abu Sufyaan is a stingy man and he does not 
    give me enough for myself and my child unless I take it from him without his 
    knowledge.” He said, “Take what is sufficient for you and your child, on a 
    reasonable basis.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5364). 

    We ask Allaah to reconcile you both and make things easier 
    for you both. Praise be to Allaah, the Lord of the Worlds.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
23485,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23485,How can someone who used to commit adultery and steal repent?,"If someone is a very bad Muslim. He/she commits adultry, steals, and gambles. What is the punishment for that person? Just suppose, later in his/her life he/she realize that he wants to be punished for all the sins he has commited. What should that person do? Can he/she go and tell the world to cut-off his hands, and slaughter his head because he is a sinner?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Adultery (zina) is a major sin. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And come not near to unlawful sex [zina]. Verily, it is a Faahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits: a great sin, and an evil way that leads one to hell unless Allaah Forgives him)”
[al-Isra’ 17:32]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The adulterer is not a believer at the moment when he is committing adultery; the wine-drinker is not a believer at the moment when he is drinking wine; the thief is not a believer at the moment when he is stealing; the robber is not a believer at the moment when he is robbing and the people are looking on.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2475; Muslim, 57). 
It is a major sin, and the one who does it is warned of a painful torment. In an important hadeeth – the hadeeth of the Mi’raaj – the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “We went on and we came to something like a tannoor oven.” I [the narrator] think that he said, that in it there were shouting and voices. “We looked inside and we saw naked men and women, towards whom flames were coming from the bottom of the oven. When the flames reached them they made a noise. I said to them [the two angels], ‘Who are these people?’ … They said to me, ‘We will tell you… the naked men and women in the structure like a tannoor oven are the adulterers and adulteresses.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari in Baab Ithm al-Zunaat, no. 7047). 
Allaah also punishes the adulterers severely in this world, and has prescribed the hadd punishment for that. Allaah says concerning the unmarried person who commits zina: 
“The fornicatress and the fornicator, flog each of them with a hundred stripes. Let not pity withhold you in their case, in a punishment prescribed by Allaah, if you believe in Allaah and the Last Day. And let a party of the believers witness their punishment”
[al-Noor 24:2 – interpretation of the meaning]
With regard to one who is married, the hadd punishment is execution. It says in a hadeeth narrated by Imam Muslim in his Saheeh (3199) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “For a married or previously-married person the punishment is one hundred lashes and stoning.” 
Secondly:
 Stealing is also a major sin. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (as for) the male thief and the female thief, cut off (from the wrist joint) their (right) hands as a recompense for that which they committed, a punishment by way of example from Allaah”
[al-Maa'idah 5:38]
It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) addressed the people of the Day of Sacrifice and said: “O people, what day is this?” They said, “A sacred day.” He said, “What land is this?” They said, “A sacred land.” He said, “What month is this?” They said, “A sacred month.” He said, “Your blood, your wealth and your honour are as sacred to you as this day of yours in this land of yours in this month of yours.” He repeated it several times, then he raised his head and said, “O Allaah, have I conveyed (the message)? O Allaah, have I conveyed (the message)?” Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, this was his last advice to his ummah, so let those who are present convey it to those who are absent.” 
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1652) 
The punishment for stealing is amputation of the right hand as is mentioned in the aayah quoted above. 
So we advise the one who is asking this question to repent and seek forgiveness for his sins. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them (till his death)”
[Ta-Ha 20:82]
It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: “I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: ‘Allaah says: “O son of Adam, so long as you call upon Me and ask of Me, I shall forgive you for what you have done, and I shall not mind. O son of Adam, were your sins to reach the clouds of the sky and were you then to ask forgiveness of Me, I would forgive you and I would not mind. O son of Adam, were you to come to Me with sins nearly as great as the earth and were you then to face Me, ascribing no partner to Me, I would bring you forgiveness nearly as great as it.”’” 
(al-Tirmidhi, 3540; classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 4338) 
It was narrated from Abu Dharr that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that Allaah says: “… O My slaves, you commit sin night and day, and I forgive all sins, so ask Me for forgiveness …”
(Muslim, 2577) 
Fourthly: 
Repentance that is a matter between a person and his Lord is better for him than confessing his sin before a qaadi (judge) so that the hadd punishment may be carried out on him. 
In Saheeh Muslim (1695) it is narrated that when Maa’iz came to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, “Purify me,” he said, “Woe to you! Go back and pray to Allaah for forgiveness and repent to Him.” 
Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: 
It may be understood from this case – the case of Maa’iz when he confessed to having committed zina – that it is mustahabb for the one who falls into a similar sin to repent to Allaah and conceal his sin and not mention it to anyone, as Abu Bakr and ‘Umar said to Maa’iz. Whoever discovers anything of that nature should conceal it according to what we have mentioned; he should not expose it or refer the matter to the ruler, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said in this story: “If you had concealed it with your garment it would have been better for you.” Hence al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “If a person commits a sin and Allaah conceals it for him, I prefer for him to conceal it too and to repent,” and he quoted as evidence the story of Maa’iz with Abu Bakr and ‘Umar.

 And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
23487,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23487,Claims that the Qur’aan has been distorted,"Dear Sir, please try to answer my question as it is very important to me. I have read in an antiislamic website run by a christian theologist from England that the scholar ""Al-Sagistany"" wrote in his book called ""Almasahif"" that the Muslim leader ""Al-Hajjajj "" changed letters in the Quran in about at least ten words . He claims that ""Alsagistany"" reported this and that he wrote it under the title: ""Ma Ghayarraho Alhajjajj Fe Moshaf Othman"". this christian also narrates in Arabic what he claims to be a copy of this page with the ten words which he claims had letters changed in them.
I have tried to find a copy of that book to search the matter but I failed. Please try your best efforts to make this matter clear . Also it is unimaginable to me that the whole Muslim scholars and memorizers of Quran could have just accepted someone to change in the Quran without stopping this or not knowing about it. Even if Alsagistany really reported this, it still really doesnot make sense at all; first of all because we are not like christians and jews who dont memorize their books totally and it is mainly left to religious scholars. Instead very large numbers of muslims memorize the Quran and almost all read it . So changes could not have just passed unnoticed except by Alsagistany especially that at this era there were already several total copies of the Quran in all muslim countries. Secondly, if it is very difficult to believe that these changes were not noticed by scholars or people at the time, then it is far more difficult to imagine that any muslim scholar or even lay man would know of the changes to the book of Allah and keep quiet and not fight this thing and just accept it. Sir, it just could not happen.
So please try to find this book and clarify the matter for me in great detail with definite evidence and proofs as much as Allah will help you. I appreciate your cooperation and again forgive me for my long letter but I cannot tell you how important this matter is to me. I put all my trust and hope in Allah that I will find a really clear and clearcut answer.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
It is not possible for a Muslim to entertain doubts concerning the immutability of the Qur’aan, because Allaah has guaranteed to preserve the Qur’aan. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur’aan) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)”
[al-Hijr 15:9]
The Qur’aan was preserved in the hearts of the Sahaabah who had memorized it, and on the trunks of trees and thin white stones until the time of the caliph Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with him). During the Riddah wars many of the Sahaabah who had memorized the Qur’aan were killed, so Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) was afraid that the Qur’aan may be lost. He consulted the senior Sahaabah concerning the idea of compiling the entire Qur’aan in one book so that it would be preserved and would not be lost, and this task was entrusted to the great hafiz Zayd ibn Thaabit and others who had written down the Revelation. Al-Bukhaari narrated in his Saheeh that Zayd ibn Thaabit (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:  
“Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq sent for me when the people of Yamamah had been killed (i.e., a number of the Prophet's Companions who fought against Musaylimah). (I went to him) and found 'Umar bin al-Khattaab sitting with him. Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) said (to me), ‘ ‘Umar has come to me and said: “Casualties were heavy among the Qurra' of the Qur'aan (i.e. those who knew the Qur’aan by heart) at the Battle of Yamaamah, and I am afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the Qurra' on other battlefields, whereby a large part of the Qur'an may be lost. Therefore I suggest that you [Abu Bakr] should issue orders that the Qur’aan be collected.” I said to 'Umar, “How can you do something that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not do?"" 'Umar said, “By Allah, this is something good.” ‘Umar kept on urging me (to accept his proposal) until Allah opened my heart to it and I began to realize the good in the idea which 'Umar had realized.’ Then Abu Bakr said (to me): ‘You are a wise young man and we have a great deal of confidence in you. You used to write down the Revelation for the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). So you should seek out the Qur’aan [i.e., the fragments on which it is written] and collect it (in one book).’ By Allaah, if they had ordered me to move one of the mountains, it would not have been harder for me than this command to collect the Qur’aan. I said (to Abu Bakr), ‘How can you do something which the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not do?’ Abu Bakr said, ‘By Allaah, it is a good thing.’ Abu Bakr kept on urging me (to accept his proposal) until Allah opened my heart to it as He had opened the hearts of Abu Bakr and ‘Umar. So I started to look for the Qur’aan and collected it from (the fragments on which it was written of) palm-stalks, thin white stones and the hearts of men (i.e., from men who knew it by heart), until I found the last verse of Soorat al-Tawbah with Abu Khuzaymah al-Ansaari, and I did not find it with anybody other than him. The verse is :  
‘Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty…’
[al-Tawbah 9:128 – interpretation of the meaning]
… until the end of Soorat Baraa’ah (Soorat al-Tawbah). 
These fragments remained with Abu Bakr until he died, then with ‘Umar for the rest of his life, then with Hafsah bint ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both).” 
Secondly: 
With regard to al-Hajjaaj, it was not his idea to write out the Mus-haf, rather he was commanded by an intelligent man to do that. There follows the complete story: 
Al-Zarqaani said: 
It is known that the Mus-haf of ‘Uthmaan was unpointed (i.e., it had no diacritical marks). Whatever the case the addition of diacritical marks to the Mus-haf did not happen, according to the well-established view, until the era of ‘Abd al-Malik ibn Marwaan, when he realized that Islam had spread widely and the Arabs were mixing with the non-Arabs, which was having an effect on the Arabic language, so that there was much confusion about the correct reading of the Mus-hafs and it was becoming very difficult for people to tell the letters apart. By his deep insight, he realized that he should do something to solve the problem. So he commanded al-Hajjaaj to take care of this important matter. In obedience to the caliph, Al-Hajjaaj appointed two men to deal with this matter, namely Nasr ibn ‘Aasim al-Laythi and Yahya ibn Ya’mar al-‘Adwaani, both of whom were qualified and able to do the task required of them, because they were knowledgeable, righteous, pious and experts in Arabic language and the various readings of the Qur’aan. They had also both studied under Abu’l-Aswad al-Du’li. May Allaah have mercy on these two shaykhs, for they succeeded in their work and gave the Mus-haf diacritical points for the first time. They added dots to all the letters that look similar, not adding more than three dots to any one letter. That became widespread among the people and was very effective in dispelling confusion concerning reading of the Mus-haf.  
It was said that the first person to add diacritical marks to the Mus-haf was Abu’l-Aswad al-Du’li, and that Ibn Seereen had a Mus-haf to which diacritical marks had been added by Yahya ibn Ya’mar. These opinions may be reconciled by noting that Abu’l-Aswad was the first one who added diacritical marks to the Mus-haf, but he did that for his own individual use, then Ibn Seereen followed him in that, and that ‘Abd al-Malik was the first one to add diacritical marks to the Mus-haf  in an official and public manner that was spread widely among the people in order to dispel any confusion with regard to reading Qur’aan.” 
Manaahil al-‘Irfaan, 1/280, 281 
Thirdly: 
With regard to what is mentioned in the question, quoting from al-Masaahif by Ibn Abi Dawood, there follows the report concerning that and the ruling thereon: 
It was narrated from ‘Abbaad ibn Suhayb from ‘Awf ibn Abi Jameelah that al-Hajjaaj ibn Yoosuf changed eleven letters in the Mus-haf. He said that in Soorat al-Baqarah 2:259 it said lam yatasanna wa’nzur, with no ha’, and he changed it to lam yatasannah wa’nzur (they show no change, and look…) 
In al-Maa'idah 5:48 it said sharee’atan wa minhaajan, and he changed it to shir’atan wa minhaajan (a law and a clear way) 
In Yoonus 10:22 it said, Huwa alladhi yunshirukum and he changed it to Huwa alladhi yusayyirukum (He it is Who enables you to travel…) 
In Yoosuf 12:45 it said Ana aateekum bi ta’weelihi and he changed it to Ana unabbi’ukum bi ta’weelihi (I will tell you its interpretation) 
In al-Zukhruf 43:32 it said, Nahnu qasamnaa baynahum ma’aayishahum and he changed it to Nahnu qasamnaa baynahum ma’eeshatahum (It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood) 
In al-Takweer 81:24 it said Wa ma huwa ‘ala’l-ghaybi bi zaneen and he changed it to Wa ma huwa ‘ala’l-ghaybi bi daneen (and he withholds not a knowledge of the unseen) 
Kitaab al-Masaahif by al-Sajistaani, p. 49. 
This report is da’eef jiddan (very weak) or mawdoo’ (fabricated), because its isnaad includes ‘Abbaad ibn Suhayb, whose hadeeth is to be rejected. 
‘Ali ibn al-Madeeni said: his hadeeth is no good. Al-Bukhaari, al-Nasaa’i and others said: he is matrook (to be rejected). Ibn Hibbaan said: he was a Qadari who promoted his innovated ideas, and he narrated things which a beginner in this field would realize were fabricated if he heard them. Al-Dhahabi said: he is one of those who are to be rejected. 
See Meezaan al-I’tidaal, by al-Dhahabi, 4/28. 
The text of the report is also false, because it dos not make sense that these changes could be made in the Qur’aan and then spread throughout the world. Even some of the non-Muslims, such as the Raafidis (Shi’ah) who think that the Qur’aan is incomplete, rejected this and criticized its text. 
Al-Kho’i, who is one of the Raafidis, said: “This claim is like the hallucination of one who is suffering a fever, or like the fairy tales of the insane or of children. Al-Hajjaaj was one of the governors of the Umayyads, and he is too incapable to do anything to the Qur’aan. He is even incapable of changing any of the minor issues of Islam, so how could he change the thing which is the foundation of the religion and the basis of sharee’ah? Where would he get the power to introduce this change throughout the realm of Islam and beyond at the time when the Qur’aan was well known throughout the Muslim world? How come no historian has ever mentioned this disastrous event even though it is so serious and they would have a lot of motives to mention it? How come no one among the Muslims of his time narrated it? How could the Muslims have turned a blind eye to such an action after the reign of al-Hajjaaj came to an end? Even if we assume that he could have gathered all the copies of the Qur’aan and that not one single copy escaped his grasp anywhere in the far-flung regions of the Islamic world, how could he have removed it from the hearts of the Muslims and those who had memorized it, the number of whom at that time is known only to Allaah.” 
(al-Bayaan fi Tafseer al-Qur’aan, p. 219) 
What the questioner mentions about Imam al-Sajistaani, and that he wrote a book called Ma Ghayyarahu al-Hajjaaj fi Mus-haf ‘Uthmaan (What al-Hajjaaj altered in the Mus-haf of ‘Uthmaan) is not true, rather it is a blatant lie. All there is, is the commentary that al-Sajistaani wrote concerning the words quoted above from al-Hajjaaj, entitled Baab Ma Kataba al-Hajjaaj ibn Yoosuf fi’l-Mus-haf (Chapter on what al-Hajjaaj wrote in the Mus-haf). 
On this basis, we cannot rely upon this report under any circumstances whatsoever. The fact that until now it has not been proven that anyone has succeeded in his attempt to change even one letter (of the Qur’aan) is sufficient to prove that it is a lie. If what has been narrated is true, then it would be possible to repeat it, especially at the times when the Muslims were weak and their enemies plotted against them.  It is such specious arguments that prove that these claims are false, and that our enemies are incapable of refuting the evidence of the Qur’aan or its clarity, so they resorted to attacking it.

23491,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23491,He repents then he goes back to sin,"My problem is looking at haraam things. I repent then I go back to it, and I do not know what is making me do this?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allah has created us for a great purpose, which is to worship Him alone with no partner or associate. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone)” [al-Dhaariyaat 51:56]
Every Muslim must strive to worship His Lord as much as He can. 
“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope”
[al-Baqarah 2:286 – interpretation of the meaning]
But man is weak and surrounded by enemies on all sides, and his own self urges him to do evil, and the Shaytaan flows through him like blood, and he lives in this world which is attractive to him… so how can he be safe from these enemies unless Allah has mercy on him? 
However, Hell is surrounded with whims and desires, and Paradise is surrounded with difficulties. So each person must turn to Allah and ask Him to help him to remember Him and be grateful to Him and to worship Him properly. Abu Bakr came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said to him, “Teach me a du’aa’ that I can say in my prayer.” He said, “Say Allahumma inni zalamtu nafsi zulman katheeran wa laa yaghfir al-dhunooba illa anta faghfir li maghfiratan min ‘indika warhamni innaka anta al-Ghafoor al-Raheem (O Allah, I have done great injustice to myself and no one forgives sin except You. Grant me forgiveness from You and have mercy on me, for You are the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful).” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 834; Muslim, 2705). 
Think about this hadeeth, how the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him), who is the best of this ummah after the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), to say, “O Allah, I have done great injustice to myself.” If Abu Bakr was to say this – when he was the best of the people – then what should we say?! O Allah, bestow Your mercy upon us. 
There was another Sahaabi – one of the best and most knowledgeable of the Sahaabah – to whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “I love you, O Mu’aadh.” (Mu’aadh said), “And I love you, O Messenger of Allah.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not forget to say in every prayer, ‘Rabbi a’inni ‘ala dhikrika wa shukrika wa husni ‘ibaadatika (O Allah, help me to remember You, thank You and worship You properly.).’” (al-Nasaa’i, 1303; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i, 1236). 
Look at this advice that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave to one of those whom he loved the most, how he told he to ask Allah to help to worship Him, for if a person is deprived of such help from Allah then he is indeed deprived. 
So we must turn to Allah and ask Him to help us to do that which He has enjoined upon us. 
Because all human beings are bound to fall short, Allah has commanded us to repent from all sins. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And all of you beg Allah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful” [al-Noor 24:31]
“Seek the forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance” [Hood 11:3]
“O you who believe! Turn to Allah with sincere repentance! It may be that your Lord will expiate from you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise)” [al-Tahreem 66:8]
“In these verses, Allah links expiation of sin and admission to Paradise to sincere repentance, which includes giving up sin and avoiding it, regretting what has happened in the past and sincere resolve never to return to it out of fear and respect for Allah, hoping for His reward and fearing His punishment.” 
(Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa – al-‘Aqeedah, part 2, p. 640). 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, ‘By Allah, I ask the forgiveness of Allah and repent to Him more than seventy times each day.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6307). 
It was narrated that Abu Burda said: “I heard al-Agharr, who was one of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, ‘The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “O people, repent to Allah, for I repent to Him one hundred times each day.”’” (Narrated by Muslim, 2702). 
These reports encourage us to repent to Allah. The leader of those who repent – the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – repented to Allah one hundred times each day, so it is more essential for us to repent a great deal, because of our many sins. There is no power and no strength except with Allah. 
With regard to your saying that you repent and then go back to sin, then you repent and then go back to sin, we say to you that even if you go back to sin time and time again, you should repent a great deal and annoy your Shaytaan who is laying in wait for you. Remember that Allah “spreads out His hand at night to accept the repentance of those who sinned during the day, and He spreads out His hand during the day to accept the repentance of those who sinned during the night, (and this will continue) until the sun rises from the west.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2759) 
The gate of repentance is open. Abu Hurayrah said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever repents before the sun rises from the west, Allah will accept his repentance.’” (Narrated by Muslim, 2703). 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah will accept the repentance of His slave so long as the death rattle has not yet reached his throat.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi and classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2802). 
But you should note that there are conditions for repentance which must be met if it is to be acceptable according to sharee’ah. These conditions are explained in detail in the answer to question no. 13990. Please see also question no. 5092. 
Finally we advise you to strive against your self which urges you to do evil, and to seek refuge with Allah from its evil and the evil of the accursed Shaytaan. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to seek refuge with Allah from the evil of his own self and from the evil and snares of the Shaytaan, as it says in the hadeeth: “A’oodhu bika min sharri nafsi wa sharri’l-shaytaan wa sharakihi (I seek refuge with You from the evil of my own self and from the evil of the Shaytaan and his snares).” 
You should also keep away from the means of sin; Allah has warned us against approaching zina, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And come not near to unlawful sex” [al-Isra’ 17:32]
That is done by keeping away from the things that lead to zina. 
Keep on beseeching Allah and making du’aa’ asking Him to give you strength, expiate your sins and bless you with taqwa (piety). 
We ask Allah to bless us all with sincere repentance. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.",Islam Q&A
23496,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23496,Hadeeth about women uncovering their faces,"How sound is that hadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is reported to have said, “When a woman reaches the ages of adolescence, nothing should be seen of her except her face and hands”? How should the Muslim woman dress, based on this? What if extreme hijab will cause problems for a woman in the society in which she lives?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The hadeeth mentioned in the question was 
    narrated by Abu Dawood (4104) from al-Waleed from Sa’eed ibn Basheer from Qataadah from Khaalid ibn Durayk from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased 
    with her), that Asma’ bint Abi Bakr entered upon the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wearing a thin dress. 
    The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) turned away from her and said, “O Asma’, when a woman reaches the age of 
    puberty, nothing should be seen of her except this and this” – and he pointed to his face and hands. 
Abu Dawood said: This is mursal; Khaalid ibn 
    Durayk did not meet ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her). 
This hadeeth is da’eef (weak) and is not fit 
    to be used as evidence. The reasons why it is da’eef are as follows: 
1 – Its isnaad is interrupted, as was stated 
    by Imam Abu Dawood (may Allaah have mercy on him) when he said, “This is mursal; Khaalid ibn Durayk did not meet ‘Aa’ishah.” 
2 – Its isnaad includes Sa’eed ibn Basheer 
    al-Azdi (or it was said al-Basri) Abu ‘Abd al-Rahmaan. Some scholars of hadeeth regarded him as thiqah (trustworthy), but Ahmad, Ibn Ma’een, Ibn 
    al-Madeeni, al-Nasaa’i, al-Haakim and Abu Dawood regarded him as da’eef. (weak). 
Muhammad ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Numayr said of 
    him: His hadeeth is to be rejected and he does not amount to anything, and he is not strong in hadeeth. He narrated munkar reports from Qataadah. 
Ibn Hibbaan said of him: He has a bad memory 
    and makes grievous mistakes. 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said of him: (he is) 
    da’eef. 
3 – Its isnaad includes Qataadah who is 
    mudallis (i.e., gives false impressions concerning the narration of the hadeeth) and did not clearly state that he heard the hadeeth from another. 
    It also includes al-Waleed ibn Muslim of whom al-Haafiz said: (he is) trustworthy but he was also mudallis and did not clearly state that he heard 
    the hadeeth from another. 
These are the faults in the hadeeth because 
    of which the hadeeth was judged to be da’eef (weak). See Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, Majallat al-Buhooth, 21/68. 
Even if we assume that the hadeeth is saheeh 
    or is strengthened by corroborating reports, the scholars have also noted that this incident occurred before hijab was enjoined. Ibn Qudaamah 
    said: “With regard to the hadeeth of Asma’, it is to be understood as having occurred before the verse of hijab was revealed.” 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: “Even if we assume it is saheeh, it is to be interpreted as referring to the time before hijab was revealed.” See ‘Awdat 
    al-Hijaab, 3/336. 
If we study the text of the hadeeth , we will 
    find that it is extremely unlikely, because Asma’ (may Allaah be pleased with her) was very pious and modest, so she would not have worn these 
    thin clothes and appeared in them in front of the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
The correct view on this matter is that it is 
    obligatory for women to cover their entire bodies in front of non-mahram men. See question no.
    21134. 
If hijab is going to lead to problems for a 
    woman in the society in which she lives, then she must be patient and seek reward for the problems she encounters for the sake of adhering to her 
    religion and obeying her Lord. We have a good example in our righteous forebears, may Allaah be pleased with them, because they were persecuted 
    severely for the sake of Allaah, but that did not turn them away from their religion, rather the persecution and torment only increased their 
    adherence to their religion. Perhaps the days we are living through are the days of patience of which the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) told us when he said: “There will come a time of patience when the one who adheres steadfastly to his religion will be like 
    one who holds a burning coal.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2260; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 957. 
Al-Qaari said: The apparent meaning of this 
    hadeeth is that just as it is impossible to hold on to a burning coal except with intense patience and great difficulty, at that time no one will 
    be able to adhere to his religion and the light of faith except with great patience.  
From Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi. 
Al-Mannaawi said in Fayd al-Qadeer: 
The one who is patient in adhering to the 
    rulings of the Qur’aan and Sunnah is likened, in the difficulties that he encounters from the followers of innovation and misguidance, to one who 
    takes hold of fire; it may be even more difficult than that. This is one of the miracles of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him): he spoke of the unseen and it came to pass. 
We ask Allaah to make us steadfast in 
    adhering to His religion until we meet Him.
