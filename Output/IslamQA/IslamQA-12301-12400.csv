12301,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12301,"It is not permissible to watch pornography at all, not even with one’s wife","pornography is prohibited in islam. How big a sin is ""watching"" pornographic material with your wife once in a while?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Watching pornography is forbidden, whether a person is married or not. The one who does that has to repent to Allaah. How can a person watch such things with his wife and he can he permit her to watch it too? Women are weak and are easily influenced; indeed watching such things may lead to problems between the spouses which may end up in divorce – Allaah forbid. Undoubtedly if a man approves of such a thing he is lacking in gheerah (protective jealousy), which is what distinguishes a Muslim from others, from kaafirs and duyooths (cuckolds) who approve of obscenity and immorality in their families. Moreover, watching such material makes one take the matter of immorality lightly and encourages promiscuity. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound. Let the one who has committed such a sin beware of the punishment of Allaah; let him hasten to repent. He should be keen to look for anything that may help his wife to remain chaste, not for things that will encourage immoral actions.

12305,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12305,Importance of Prayer,What is the Importance of Prayer?,"The importance of the prayer in Islam cannot be understated. Prayer is the first pillar of Islam that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) mentioned after mentioning the testimony of faith, by which one becomes a Muslim.",,"Praise be to Allah.The importance of the prayer in Islam cannot be understated. It is the first pillar of Islam that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) mentioned after mentioning the testimony of faith, by which one becomes a Muslim. It was made obligatory upon all the prophets and for all peoples. Allah has declared its obligatory status under majestic circumstances. For example, when Allah spoke directly to Moses, He said,
""And I have chosen you, so listen to that which is inspired to you. Verily, I am Allah! There is none worthy of worship but I, so worship Me and offer prayer perfectly for My remembrance."" [Taha 13-14]
Similarly, the prayers were made obligatory upon the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) during his ascension to heaven. Furthermore, when Allah praises the believers, such as in the beginning of Surah al-Muminun, one of the first descriptions He states is their adherence to the prayers.
Once a man asked the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) about the most virtuous deed. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) stated that the most virtuous deed is the prayer. The man asked again and again. The first three times, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) again answered, ""The prayer,"" then on the fourth occasion he stated, ""Jihad in the way of Allah."" [This is from a hadith recorded by Ahmad and ibn Hibban. According to al-Albani, the hadith is hasan. Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani, Sahih al-Targhib wa al-Tarhib (Beirut: al-Maktab al-Islami, 1982), vol. 1, p. 150]
The importance of prayer is demonstrated in many of the Prophet’s statements. For example, the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said,
""The first matter that the slave will be brought to account for on the Day of Judgment is the prayer. If it is sound, then the rest of his deeds will be sound. And if it is bad, then the rest of his deeds will be bad."" [Recorded by al-Tabarani. According to al-Albani, it is sahih. Al-Albani, (Sahih al-Jami’, vol.1, p. 503)
The importance of the prayers lies in the fact that no matter what actions one performs in his life, the most important aspect is one’s relationship to Allah, that is, one’s faith (iman), God-consciousness (taqwa), sincerity (ikhlas) and worship of Allah (`ibadah). This relationship with Allah is both demonstrated and put into practice, as well as improved and increased, by the prayer. Therefore, if the prayers are sound and proper, the rest of the deeds will be sound and proper; and if the prayers are not sound and proper, then the rest of the deeds will not be sound and proper, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) himself stated.
In reality, if the prayer is performed properly – with true remembrance of Allah and turning to Him for forgiveness – it will have a lasting effect on the person. After he finishes the prayer, his heart will be filled with the remembrance of Allah. He will be fearful as well as hopeful of Allah. After that experience, he will not want to move from that lofty position to one wherein he disobeys Allah. Allah has mentioned this aspect of the prayer when He has said,
""Verily, the prayer keeps one from the great sins and evil deeds"" (al-Ankabut 45). An-Nadwi has described this effect in the following eloquent way,
Its aim is to generate within the subliminal self of man such spiritual power, light of faith and awareness of God as can enable him to strive successfully against all kinds of evils and temptations and remain steadfast at times of trial and adversity and protect himself against the weakness of the flesh and the mischief of immoderate appetites. [an_Nadwi, p. 24]
The overall effect that the properly performed prayers should have upon humans is described in other verses in the Quran:
""Verily, man was created impatient, irritable when evil touches him and withholding when good touches him. Except for those devoted to prayer those who remain constant in their prayers…"" (al-Ma’arij 19-23).
As for the Hereafter, Allah’s forgiveness and pleasure is closely related to the prayers. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said,
""Allah has obligated five prayers . Whoever excellently performs their ablutions, prays them in their proper times, completes their bows, prostrations and khushu` [Khushu` in the prayer is where the person’s heart is attuned to the prayer. This feeling in the heart is then reflected on the body. The person remains still and calm. His gaze is also lowered. Even his voice is affected by this feeling in the heart. For more details on this concept (as well as the difference between it and khudhu`), see Muhammad al-Shayi’, al-Furuq al-Laughawiyyah wa Atharaha fi Tafsir al-Quran al-Karim (Riyadh: Maktabah al-Ubaikan, 1993), pp. 249-254.] has a promise from Allah that He will forgive him. And whoever does not do that has no promise from Allah. He may either forgive him or punish him."" [Recorded by Malik, Ahmad, Abu Dawud, al-Nasai and others. According to al-Albani, it is sahih. Al-Albani, Sahih al-Jami’, vol. 1, p. 616.] ]
The prayers are a type of purification for a human being. He turns and meets with his Lord five times a day. As alluded to above, this repeated standing before Allah should keep the person from performing sins during the day. Furthermore, it should also be a time of remorse and repentance, such that he earnestly asks Allah for forgiveness for those sins that he committed. In addition, the prayer in itself is a good deed that wipes away some of the evil deeds that he performed. These points can be noted in the following hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon him):
""If a person had a stream outside his door and he bathed in it five times a day, do you think he would have any filth left on him?"" The people said, ""No filth would remain on him whatsoever."" The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) then said, ""That is like the five daily prayers: Allah wipes away the sins by them."" (Recorded by al-Bukhari and Muslim.)
In another hadith, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said,
""The five daily prayers and the Friday Prayer until the Friday prayer are expiation for what is between them."" (Recorded by Muslim)

12309,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12309,The virtue of Friday,Which day of the week do you consider most holy and your sabboth?,,,"Praise be to Allah.It should be noted that the entire life of a Muslim is worship of Allah; there is no special day for worship, for the Muslim is worshipping Allah all the time. But there is a day which Allah has made special for this ummah (nation), the nation of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and which Allah has favoured above all the other days of the week. That day is Friday. There are a number of hadeeths which speak of the virtue of this day, including the following:
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “We (Muslims) are the last (of the nations) but (we will be) the foremost on the Day of Resurrection,  although the former nations were given their scriptures before us and we were given our after them. And this (Friday) is the day concerning which they disputed. So Allah guided us (to it), tomorrow (i.e., Saturday) is for the Jews and the day after (i.e., Sunday) is for the Christians.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Jumu’ah, 847).
It was also narrated (by al-Bukhaari) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best day on which the sun rises is Friday. On this day Adam was created, on this day he entered Paradise and on this day he was expelled from it.” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Jumu’ah, 1410) 
It was narrated that Taariq ibn Shihaab said: “A Jewish man said to ‘Umar, ‘O Commander of the faithful, if this aayah – ‘This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion’ [al-Maa'idah 5:3 – interpretation of the meaning] – had been revealed to us, we would have taken that day as an ‘Eid (festival).” ‘Umar said, “I know on which day this aayah was revealed; it was revealed on the Day of ‘Arafaah, which was a Friday.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, Al-I’tisaam bi’l-Kitaab wa’l-Sunnah, 6726). 
Among the hadeeth which explain the reward for this day is that which was narrated by Abu Hurayrah, which says that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Each of the five daily prayers and from one Jumu’ah prayer to the next is an expiation for the time in between, so long as one does not commit any major sin.”  (al-Tahaarah, 342). 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘When Friday comes, at each door of the mosque there are angels who write down the first ones to come to the mosque. Then when the imaam sits down they close their books and come to listen to the sermon. The one who comes early (for Friday prayer) is like who sacrificed a camel, then those who come after him (in order of their coming) are like one who sacrificed a cow, then one who sacrificed a horned ram, then one who sacrificed a chicken, then like one who offered an egg.” (narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Jumu’ah, 1416). 
It was also narrated in a hadeeth that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “One of the best of your days is Friday. On it Adam was created and on it he died. On it the Trumpet will be blown and on it all creatures will perish (prior to the Resurrection on the Last Day). So send many blessings upon me on that day, for your blessings will be shown to me.” They said, “How will our blessings be shown to you when your body will have become dust?” He said, “Allah has forbidden the earth to consume our [Prophets’] bodies.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood and al-Nasaa’i; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb, no. 695). 
It was narrated in a hadeeth that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever makes his wife do ghusl and does ghusl himself [i.e., has intercourse] on Friday and goes out early, walking not riding, and comes close to the imaam and listens [to the sermon] without interrupting, will have for each step he takes a reward equal to that of fasting and praying at night for one year.”
(Narrated by Ahmad and al-Tirmidhi; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb, no. 687) 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) mentioned Friday and said: “On this day there is an hour when no Muslim slave stands and prays and asks Allah for something, but Allah will give it to him,” and he gestured with his hand to indicate that whatever he asks fo , is as nothing to Allah. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Jumu’ah, 883) 
It was narrated from Anas ibn Maalik that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Seek the hour in which there is hope that prayers will be answered, on Friday after ‘Asr (mid-afternoon) prayer, until the sun goes down.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb, no. 700).

          means:  
The first view is that it means, Do not ask any created 
          being by the Face of Allaah. If you want to ask any created being for 
          something, do not ask by the Face of Allaah, because nothing may be 
          asked for by the Face of Allaah except Paradise, and people cannot give 
          Paradise, so created beings should not be asked for anything by the 
          Face of Allaah at all.   
The second view is: if you ask of Allaah, 
          if you are asking for Paradise and the means to get there, then ask 
          by the Face of Allaah. If you are asking for some worldly thing, then 
          do not ask by the Face of Allaah. But matters of the Hereafter may be 
          asked for by the Face of Allaah, for example you could say, “I ask You 
          by Your Face to save me from Hell.” The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sought refuge in the Face 
          of Allaah when Allaah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning):

He (the Prophet

How to raise hands in Qunut","Praise be to Allah.Is Qunut before or after Ruku`?
With regard to the question of whether al-qunut should be recited before or after ruku`, Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: 
“According to most of the hadiths and according to the opinion of most of the scholars, al-qunut should come after the ruku`, but if a person recites it before the ruku` that is OK. He has the choice of bowing when he has finished reciting from Quran, and when he stands up from bowing and says “Rabbana wa laka’l hamd,” then he may recite al-qunut , as described in most of the reports from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and as stated by most of the scholars; or he may recite al-qunut when he has finished reciting Quran, then say Allahu akbar and bow. Both ways were narrated in the Sunnah.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 4/65) 
How to raise hands in Qunut
The way in which the hands are to be raised, the scholars said that he should raise his hands to chest level and not raise them very much, and he should spread his palms and hold them facing up towards the sky. The apparent meaning of the scholars’ words indicates that the hands should be put together, like a beggar when he asks someone to give him something. As for holding them far apart, I know of no basis for that in the Sunnah or in the words of the scholars. (See al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 4/25)

12315,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12315,Suffering From Waswas (Insinuating Whispers) of the Shaytan About the Essence of Allah,"A man is experiencing waswas (insinuating whispers) from the Shaytan (devil) having to do with Allah, and he is very afraid of that.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The questioner has mentioned this problem and is afraid of its consequences. I say to him, rejoice, for its consequences cannot be anything but good. By means of this waswas, the Shaytan tries to gain control over the believers and shake the sound belief in their hearts, and make them suffer psychological and intellectual anxiety that will affect the purity of their faith and their life, if they are believers. 
This is not the first or the last time that the believers have been exposed to this. It will continue so long as there is any believer in this world. The Sahabah/Companions of the Prophet (may Allah be pleased with them) also faced this problem. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Some of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said to him, ‘We find in ourselves thoughts that are too terrible to speak of.’ He said, ‘Are you really suffering from that?’ They said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘That is a clear sign of faith.’” (Muslim).  
It was narrated in al-Saheehayn, also from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “The Shaytan comes to one of you and says, ‘Who created such and such? Who created such and such?’ Until he says, ‘Who created your Lord?!’ If that happens to any of you, let him seek refuge with Allah and put a stop to these thoughts.” 
It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) that a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, “I think thoughts to myself, which I would rather be burnt to a cinder than speak of them.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Praise be to Allah, Who has reduced all his [the Shaytan’s] plots to mere whispers.” (Abu Dawood). 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Kitab al-Eeman: “The believer may suffer from the whispers of the Shaytan insinuating thoughts of kufr (disbelief), which may make him feel distressed. The Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, some of us think thoughts which we would rather fall from heaven to earth than speak of them.’ He said, ‘That is a clear sign of faith.’ According to one report, ‘… thoughts which are too terrible to speak of.’ He said, ‘Praise be to Allah, Who has reduced all his [the Shaytan’s] plots to mere whispers,’ meaning that the fact that these whispers come, but they are so greatly disliked, and they are pushed away from the heart, is a clear sign of faith. This is like the mujahid (warrior) to whom the enemy comes, but he resists him until he overwhelms him, and this is a mighty jihad (battle)… Hence the seekers of knowledge and devoted worshippers experience waswas and doubts which others do not face, because they (the others) are not following the way prescribed by Allah, rather they are following their own whims and desires and neglecting to remember their Lord. This is what the Shaytan wants, in contrast to those who are striving to draw closer to their Lord by seeking knowledge and worshipping Him. He is their enemy and seeks to prevent them from drawing closer to Allah.” (p.147 of the Indian edition) 
I say to this questioner, if you are faced with this waswas from the Shaytan, then fight it and resist it. Know that it can never harm you when you fulfill the duty of fighting and resisting it, and you refuse to be controlled by it. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Allah will forgive my ummah (followers) for any insinuating whispers that may cross their minds, so long as they do not act upon it or speak of it.” (Agreed upon). 
If it is said to you: Do you believe the insinuating whispers you experience? Do you think that they are true? Do you really think that Allah is like what this waswas says? You would say, “It is not right for us to speak of this. Glory be to You (O Allah)! This is a great lie” [24:16 ]. You would denounce that in your heart and with your tongue, and be the one who objects to it the most, for it is only whispers and thoughts that cross your mind. It is a trap set by the Shaytan, who flows through the son of Adam (peace be upon him) like blood flows, to make you doomed and to confuse you about your religion. 
Hence you will find that the Shaytan does not cast doubts or suspicions into your heart about trivial matters. For example, you may hear of the existence of great cities filled with people and buildings in the east and the west, but it would never cross your mind someday to doubt that they exist or to criticize them and say that they are in ruins and unfit for habitation, or that they are uninhabited, and so on. The Shaytan has nothing to gain by making people doubt about these cities. But he does have a lot to gain by corrupting the believer’s faith, so he strives with his cavalry and his infantry to extinguish the light of knowledge and guidance in his heart and to make him fall into the darkness of doubt and confusion. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has told us of the appropriate remedy for such problems, which is to seek refuge with Allah and put a stop to it. If a person puts a stop to it and continues to worship Allah, seeking and hoping for (the reward) which is with Allah, it will stop by Allah’s leave. So turn away from all the thoughts of this kind that cross your mind. You are worshipping Allah, calling upon Him and glorifying Him, and if you were to hear anyone ascribing to Allah the things that are whispered to you (waswas), you would probably kill him if you could. So the things that are whispered to you are neither real nor true, they are merely imagination and whispers which have no basis. 
Our advice may be summed up as follows: 
1.                           Seek refuge with Allah and give up these thoughts completely, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded.
2.                           Remember Allah and control yourself and do not continue to think of these whispers.
3.                           Occupy yourself with worship and doing good deeds, in obedience to the command of Allah and seeking to please Him. When you devote yourself completely and seriously to worship, you will forget about these whispers, in sha Allah.
4.                           Frequently seek refuge with Allah and make du’a (supplicate) to free you from these whispers.

But you did not give any Hadith to support your answer. Could you please give some basis for the answer so I could put my heart at rest.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“If you are in a state of Janaabah (i.e. after a sexual discharge), purify yourselves (bathe your whole body)” [al-Maa’idah 5:6]
Junub (the person who is in a state of janaabah) refers to the person who has emitted maniy which gushes forth, accompanied by feelings of pleasure.
“Gushing forth” refers to the aayah where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So let man see from what he is created!
He is created from a water gushing forth” [al-Taariq 86:5-6]
If the maniy is emitted whilst a person is awake, with no feelings of pleasure,  then he does not have to do ghusl. With regard to the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Water is for water” (narrated by Muslim, al-Hayd, 518), it is to be interpreted as referring to the regular case, when maniy is emitted accompanied by feelings of pleasure, and results in tiredness and exhaustion. But with regard to that which is not accompanied by feelings of pleasure, it is does not result in tiredness and exhaustion. 
Hence they said that this water (maniy) has three characteristics: 
1.It comes out gushing.
2.Its smell when it has dried is like the smell of eggs, and if it is not dry its smell is like that of mud and pollen.
3.Tiredness of the body after it is emitted. 
See al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, part 1, p. 277-278. 
The Standing Committee was asked about the obligation of doing ghusl after experiencing a wet dream. They replied: 
It is clear that ghusl is obligatory when maniy comes out gushing, accompanied by feelings of pleasure, when one is awake, and if it happens, regardless of how it comes out, when one is asleep, because Imaam Ahmad narrated from ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If water gushes, then do ghusl, and if it does not gush, then do not do ghusl.” 
Fataawa Islamiyyah, vol. 1, p. 216
It was also narrated by Abu Dawood and al-Nasaa’i that ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “My madhiy (prostatic fluid) flowed excessively and I used to keep taking baths until (the skin of) my back cracked. I mentioned that to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – or that was mentioned to him – and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Do not do that. If you see madhiy, then wash your penis and do wudoo’ as you do for prayer, but if water gushes out [i.e., maniy or semen], then do ghusl.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, al-Tahaarah, 178; al-Nasaa’i, al-Tahaarah, 193. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan Abi Dawood, no. 187). 
Ibn Al-Manzoor said: This indicates that if anything other than that is emitted when one is awake, or it flows because of sickness, then he does not have to do ghusl. 
Ibn ‘Aabideen said: If it – i.e., maniy – is emitted because of being beaten or because of carrying a heavy load on one's back, then in our view he does not have to do ghusl. 
Al-Dardeer said: If it is emitted without feelings of pleasure, rather it flows or comes because of being beaten or being stung by a scorpion, then he does not have to do ghusl. 
The Hanbalis and the Shaafa’is, according to the more correct of the two views, stated that if a man’s back is broken and maniy comes out of him, and it does not come from the penis, then he does not have to do ghusl. The Hanbalis stated clearly that the ruling in this case is like regular kinds of najaasah.

Her husband knows about her debts and agreed BEFORE the marriage that he cannot afford to pay for her debts and maybe he will if there are any extra income/money. 1. Is the debt on her husband's shoulder's now and will he be responsible for her debt in Akhirah? 2. If she is allowed to help her husband with his work and gets paid for it should she herself pay for her debts? 3. What will happen to both of them if they don't pay her debts on time and die ?,,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          The debts owed by this woman are her responsibility;

          it. 
 
          If she is helping her husband with his work and getting 
          paid for that, then she has to try to pay off her debt from these wages 
          or otherwise. If they both die and neither of them had paid off the 
          debt, then this woman will remain accountable for it, and Allaah will 
          settle the score between her and those to whom it is owed, unless they

          on their fingers and bracelets on their wrists. Allaah says to the believing

“And let them not stamp their feet 
          so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment” [al-Noor 24:31]  
          
This indicates that the believing 
          women should not show anything from which may be known what adornments

          their hands so that people can see them?

          women in good manners and chastity. Allaah said to them (interpretation 
          of the meaning): 
“And stay in your houses, and do not 
          display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance, and perform 
          As-Salaah (Iqamat-as-Salaah), and give Zakaah and

2 – He must offer expiation for having intercourse even if he was unaware of the fact that he would have to offer expiation for having intercourse. 
3 – The wife must also offer expiation for having intercourse if she willingly went along with her husband in that. But if she was forced then she does not have to do anything. 
4 – It is not permissible to give money instead of feeding a poor person, and that is not sufficient. 
5 – It is permissible to feed one poor person half a saa’ on behalf of himself and half a saa’ on behalf of his wife. That will be considered to be one of the sixty poor persons who must be fed on behalf of them both. 
6 – it is not permissible to give it all to one poor person, or to a charitable organization etc., because they may not distribute it to sixty poor persons. The believer must strive to discharge his duty with regard to expiations and other obligations.

Can the wife pay Zakah to her husband?","Praise be to Allah.Who pays Zakah on wife's gold?
The husband does not have to pay Zakah on the jewelry on his wife’s behalf, because the Zakah is only obligatory on the possessor of the wealth, and the possessor in this case is your wife, because she is the owner of the jewelry. So she has to pay Zakah on it, either from the jewelry itself or from its monetary value .
If her husband or someone else pays Zakah on her behalf with her permission, that is OK, and he will be rewarded for this voluntary action. 
Can the wife pay Zakah to her husband?
If the wife wants to give the Zakah on her jewelry or anything else to her husband who is in debt and cannot pay it off or who is poor, there is nothing wrong with that, because it comes under the general meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“As-Sadaqat (here it means Zakah) are only for the poor, and the needy…” [At-Tawbah 9:60] 
Indeed, there is the hope that she will have a multiple reward, because of the Hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari (1466) and Muslim (1000) from Zaynab (may Allah be pleased with her), the wife of `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: `Give in charity, O women, even if it is from your jewelry.’ I went back to `Abdullah and said, `You are a man who has little wealth, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has commanded us to give in charity. Go and ask him if that is acceptable, otherwise I will give my charity to someone else.’ `Abdullah said to me, `No, you go and ask him.’ So I went, and there I saw a woman from among the Ansar at the door of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), wanting to ask the same question. We felt too shy to speak to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Bilal came out to us and we said to him, `Go to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and tell him that there are two women at the door asking whether it is acceptable for them to give charity (Zakah) to their husbands and the orphans who are in their care, but do not tell him who we are.’ Bilal went in to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and asked him, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked, `Who are they?’ He said, `A woman from among the Ansar and Zaynab.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked, `Which Zaynab?’ He said, `The wife of `Abdullah.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him, ‘They will have two rewards, the reward of (upholding ties of) kinship and the reward of giving charity.’” 
Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “From this Hadith it may be understood that it is permissible for a woman to give Zakah to her husband. This is the view of Ash-Shafi`i, Ath-Thawri, the two companions of Abu Hanifah, one of the two reports narrated from Malik and from Ahmad.”

This fluid which comes out after doing

(O Allah, forgive our living and our dead, those who are present among us and those who are absent, our young and our old, our males and our females. O Allah, whoever You keep alive, keep him alive in Islam, and whoever You cause to die, cause him to die with faith. O Allah, forgive him and have mercy on him, keep him safe and sound and forgive him, honour the place where he settles and make his entrance wide; wash him with water and snow and hail, and cleanse him of sin as a white garment is cleansed of dirt. O Allah, give him a house better than his house and a family better than his family. O Allah, admit him to Paradise and protect him from the torment of the grave and the torment of Hell-fire; make his grave spacious and fill it with light. O Allah, do not deprive us of the reward and do not cause us to go astray after this).” 
If you make du'a’ with other words, this is OK, for example, you could say: “Allahumma in kana muhsinan fa zid fi ihsanihi wa in kana museean fa tajawaz ‘an sayiatihi. Allahumma ighfir lahu wa thabbit-hu bi’l-qawl il-thabit (O Allah, if he was a doer of good, then increase his good deeds, and if he was a wrongdoer, then overlook his bad deeds.

12364,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12364,Is Marriage in Shawwal Disliked?,Is what people say about avoiding getting married in Shawwal correct?,There is no basis for the false superstition about marriage in Shawwal. It is one of the leftovers of the Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic era) when they used to be superstitious about that because of the connotations of the name of Shawwal which related to the drying up of the camel’s milk and the lifting of its tail.,,"Praise be to Allah.Ibn Mandhur (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Shawwal is one of the well-known names of months, the name of the month which follows Ramadan and is the first of the months of Hajj.” 
It was said that it was called after the drying up of the camels’ milk (Tashwil), when it becomes scanty. This is what happens to the camels when the heat becomes intense and there are no longer any dates on the palm trees… 
The Arabs were superstitious about getting married at that time, and they would say that the bride would keep away from her groom like the female camel when she has been impregnated and lifted (Shalat) her tail. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) declared their superstition to be false. `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married me in Shawwal and consummated the marriage with me in Shawwal, and which of his wives was more favoured by him than me?” (Narrated by Ahmad in Al-Musnad, 6/54; this version narrated by him. Also narrated by Muslim, 2/1039, Kitab An-Nikah, 1423. Also narrated At-Tirmidhi in his Sunan, 2/277, Abwab An-Nikah, 1099; he said it is an authentic Hadith. Also narrated by An-Nasa’i in his Sunan, 6/70, Kitab An-Nikah, Bab At-Tazwij fi Shawwal. Also narrated by Ibn Majah in his Sunan, 1/641, Kitab An-Nikah, 1990. Lisan Al-`Arab, 11/277, heading Shawwal)
The reason why the Arabs of the Jahiliyyah were so superstitious about marrying during Shawwal was that they believed that a woman would keep away from her husband like the she-camel that has lifted (Shawwalat) its tail after being impregnated keeps away from the he-camel. 
Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) consummated his marriage with `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) during Shawwal was a refutation of the notions that some people held, that it was disliked to consummate a marriage between the two `Eids, lest that lead to separation of the spouses. But that was a false notion.” (Al-Bidayah wan Nihayah, 3/253) 
Being superstitious about getting married in Shawwal is the matter of falsehood, because superstition in general is part of the “evil omen” (Tiyarah) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade when he said, “There is no contagion and no evil omen.” (Sharh Sahih Muslim, 14/219, 218). And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Tiyarah (believing in evil omens) is Shirk.” (Narrated by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad, 1/440. Also narrated by Abu Dawud in his Sunan, 4/230, Kitab At-Tibb, 3910. Also narrated by At-Tirmidhi in his Sunan, 3/84, 85, Abwab As-Siyar, 1663; he said, it is an authentic Hadith. Also narrated by Ibn Majah in his Sunan, 2/1170, Kitab At-Tibb, 3538. Also narrated by Al-Hakim in Al-Mustadrak, 1/17, 18, Kitab Al-Iman; he said it is a Hadith whose Isnad (chain of narration) is authentic and its narrators are trustworthy, although they [Al-Bukhari and Muslim] did not narrate it; Adh-Dhahabi agreed with [the ruling of] Al-Hakim in At-Talkhis). 
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on the Hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her): “This indicates that it is recommended to get married and to consummate the marriage in Shawwal. Our companions [fellow-scholars] have stated that this is recommended, quoting this Hadith as evidence for that.” 
By saying this, `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) was aiming to refute the ignorant belief of the Jahiliyyah, and what some of the common folk still believe today, that it is disliked to get married or to consummate the marriage in Shawwal. This is false and there is no basis for this belief. It is one of the leftovers of the Jahiliyyah, when they used to be superstitious about that because of the connotations of the name of Shawwal which related to the drying up of the camel’s milk and the lifting of its tail…” (Sharh Sahih Muslim, 9/209)

12366,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12366,The bid’ah of Eid al-Abraar (the “festival of the righteous”),What is the ruling on Eid al-Abraar which is celebrated in Shawwaal every year?,,,"Praise be to Allah.One of the innovated things that happen in Shawwaal is the bid’ah (innovation) of “Eid al-Abraar” (the “festival of the righteous”), which is on the eighth day of Shawwaal. 
After the people have completed the fast of Ramadaan, and they broke their fast on the first day of Shawwaal – the day of Eid al-Fitr – they start to fast the first six days of Shawwaal, and on the eighth day they celebrate an “eid” which they call Eid al-Abraar. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “With regard to celebrating occasions which are not prescribed in sharee’ah – such as some nights in Rabee’ al-Awwal which are called ‘Mawlid’, or some nights in Rajab, or the eighteenth of Dhu’l-Hijjah, or the first Friday in Rajab, or the eighth of Shawwaal which the ignorant call Eid al-Abraar – these are innovations which were not approved of by the salaf and they did not do these things. And Allaah knows best.” (Majmoo’ Fataawa Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, 25/298) 
He also said: “With regard to the eighth of Shawwaal, it is not an Eid, neither for the righteous nor for the evil. It is not permissible for anyone to take it as an Eid or to do any of the things connected with celebrations on that day.” (al-Ikhtiyaaraat al-Fiqhiyyah, p. 199) 
The celebrations of this “eid” take place in one of the famous mosques, where men and women mix freely, shake hands with one another and utter words of Jaahiliyyah when they shake hands.  Then after that they go and make some foods especially for this occasion.” (al-Sunan wa’l-Mubtada’aat by al-Shuqayri, p. 166)","Al-Bida’ al-Hawliyyah by Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Ahmad al-Tuwayjri, p. 350"

Is there any verse or hadith to make the general meaning of this verse (“what is in the wombs”) more specific?","Gender reveal happens after the baby has been fully formed.

How to interpret things that happen which outwardly appear to contradict the Quran","Praise be to Allah.Is there any contradiction between an unambiguous statement of the Quran and reality?
Before I discuss this matter, I would like to explain that there can never be any contradiction between an unambiguous statement of the Quran and reality. If there appears to be a contradiction with reality, it is either because what we think is reality is a baseless claim, or the (text of) the Quran is not opposed to this reality in a clear and definite manner. The unambiguous statements of the Quran and the facts of reality are both definitive, and two definitive things can never contradict one another. 
Is gender reveal allowed in Islam?
Based on the above, it may be said that now they (doctors) are able, through the use of precise machines, to discover what is in the wombs and to find out whether it is male or female . If what is said is false, then there is no point in discussing it. If it is true, then it does not contradict the verse, because the verse is referring to a matter of the unseen, which has to do with the knowledge of Allah about these five matters . 
The matters of the unseen as far as the foetus are concerned are: how long he will remain in his mother’s womb, his life, his deeds, his provision, whether he is doomed (destined for Hell) or blessed (destined for Paradise), and – before it is fully formed – whether it will be male or female. But after it has been fully formed, knowledge of whether it is male or female is no longer the matter of the unseen , because once it has been fully formed it becomes the matter of the visible world, but it remains within the three layers of darkness which, if they were removed, it would be known what it is. It is not far-fetched to think that among the things that Allah has created are powerful rays which can penetrate these layers of darkness so that it may become clear whether the foetus is male or female. The verse does not clearly refer to knowledge of whether the foetus is male or female, and the Sunnah does not refer to that either. 
Is Gender Reveal Part of the Unseen?
With regard to what the questioner refers to, that Ibn Jarir (may Allah have mercy on him) quoted from Mujahid (may Allah have mercy on him) that a man asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) what his wife would give birth to, and Allah revealed this verse, this narration is interrupted, because Mujahid (may Allah have mercy on him) was one of the Tabi`in [the generation after the Companions]. 
The Tafsir of Qatadah (may Allah have mercy on him) may be interpreted as meaning that Allah Alone has knowledge of that so long as it has not yet been fully formed. But once the foetus is fully formed, then others may have knowledge of it. 
Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafsir of the verse from Surah Luqman (interpretation of the meaning): “No one knows what Allah wants to create in the wombs apart from Him, but once He decrees that it should be male or female, doomed or blessed, the angels who are appointed in charge of it know that, and whoever else He wills among His creation.” 
With regard to your question about what may make the general meaning of this verse (“what is in the wombs”) more specific, we say that if the verse was speaking about being male or female after the foetus is fully formed, then that which would make it more specific would be tangible facts. The scholars have mentioned the principles of making the general meanings of the Quran and Sunnah more specific, which are a text, Ijma` (scholarly consensus), Qiyas (analogy), tangible facts or reason. Their comments on this matter are well known. 
But since the verse does not refer to after the foetus is fully formed, but rather it refers to before that time, there is nothing in it that would contradict the idea of knowing whether the foetus is male or female. 
How to interpret things that happen which outwardly appear to contradict the Quran
Praise be to Allah, there is not, and never will be, anything in reality that contradicts the unambiguous statements of the Quran . The accusations made by the enemies of the Muslims against the Quran, that things happen which outwardly appear to contradict the Quran , arise from their misunderstanding of the Book of Allah which stems from their bad intentions. But the committed Muslims and scholars have enough knowledge to discover the truth which will refute the specious arguments of these people. Praise and blessings be to Allah. 
With regard to this matter, people may be one of two extremes, or a middle group. 

One extreme is to adhere to the apparent meaning of Quranic verses which are not unambiguous, and to reject any certain facts that go against it. Such people either expose themselves to criticism, or they expose the Quran to criticism, because their view contradicts the certain realities of everyday life. 
The other extreme is to turn away from that which is indicated by the Quran and to adopt a purely materialistic approach. Thus one becomes a heretic. 
The middle path is to accept both the indications of the Quran and the facts of reality. These people know that both of them are true, and that the unambiguous statements of the Quran cannot contradict something that is well known and visible. They combine acceptance of the transmitted texts with reason, thus keeping their religious commitment and their intellect safe and sound. Allah guides those who believe to the truth of that wherein they differ, and Allah guides whom He wills to a Straight Path (cf. Al-Baqarah 2:213). 

May Allah help our believing brothers to achieve that, and may He cause us to be guided and to guide others, and make us righteous leaders.

12371,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12371,"Wearing revealing and short clothes, and the limits of women’s ‘awrah in front of other women","It is becoming common for some women to wear short and tight clothes which show off their charms and which may be sleeveless or show the chest or back, so that the woman is virtually naked. When we try to advise them, they say that they only wear these clothes in front of other women, and that the ‘awrah of a woman in front of other women is the area from the navel to the knee. What is the ruling of Islam, in your opinion, with evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnah, on this matter and on wearing these kind of clothes in front of mahrams? May Allaah reward you with good on behalf of the Muslims, men and women, and make your reward great.",,,"Praise be to Allah.In response to this it might be said that it is reported 
          in a saheeh hadeeth that the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
“There are two types of the people of Hell whom I have not seen yet. 
          People with whips like the tails of cattle, with which they strike the 
          people, and women who are clothed yet naked, walking with an enticing 
          gait. They will not enter Paradise nor even smell its fragrance, although 
          its fragrance may be detected from such and such a distance.”  
          
The scholars interpret “clothed yet naked” as referring to women who 
          wear tight clothes or light clothing that does not cover what is beneath 
          it, or short clothes. Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah) mentioned that 
          what women wore inside their houses at the time of the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) covered everything from 
          the heel of the foot up to the palm of the hand. All of this was covered 
          when they were inside the house, and when they went out to the market, 
          it was known that the women of the Sahaabah used to wear loose garments 
          which would drag along the ground. The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) allowed them to let it trail 
          up to a cubit, but no more than that.  
With regards to the doubts that some women have, concerning the words 
          of the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him), “Let no woman look at the ‘awrah of another 
          woman and let no man look at the ‘awrah of another man; the ‘awrah of 
          a woman in front of another woman is from the navel to the knee”, which 
          they interpret as indicating that women may wear short clothes – the 
          Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
          Allaah be upon him) did not say that  it is sufficient for women’s 
          clothing to cover the area from the navel to the knee, so this cannot 
          be used as evidence. What he did say was that no woman should look at 
          the ‘awrah of another woman, so he forbade them to look, because the 
          ‘awrah of the woman who is wearing loose clothing may sometimes be exposed 
          when answering the call of nature or for some other reason, so the Prophet 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) forbade women to look at one another’s ‘awrahs.  
Because the Prophet  (peace and 
          blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that no man should look at the 
          ‘awrah of another man, does this means that the Sahaabah wore izaars 
          (waist wrappers) or trousers only between the navel and the knee? Does 
          anyone think that women can go to meet other women wearing nothing but 
          clothes that cover her from the navel to the knee? No one would say 
          such a thing. That only happens among the kaafir women. The confusion 
          that some women feel has no basis; what some women understand from this 
          hadeeth is not correct. The meaning of the hadeeth is clear. The Prophet 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) did not say that women's clothing should cover only the 
          area between the navel and the knee. Women have to fear Allaah and feel 
          that sense of modesty which is part of the nature of women and which 
          is part of faith, as the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Modesty is a branch 
          of faith.” And it is said in the proverbial sense, “more shy than the 
          virgin in her seclusion.” It was not even known among the women of the 
          jaahiliyyah to cover only the area from the navel to the knee, such 
          a thing was not known among either women or men; do these women want 
          the Muslim women to be even worse in appearance than the women of the 
          jaahiliyyah?  
In conclusion: the clothing is one thing and looking at 
          the ‘awrah is another thing. With regard to clothing and what a woman 
          wears in front of other women, it is prescribed for her to cover everything 
          from the palm of the hand to the heel of the foot, but if a woman needs 
          to pull up her dress in order to do some work etc., she may pull it 
          up to her knees, and if she needs to roll up her sleeves to the upper 
          arms she may do that too, if she only does it as much as is necessary. 
          But if this is the way she usually dresses, then that is not allowed. 
          The hadeeth does not indicate this under any circumstances at all, hence 
          it addresses the one who is looking, not the one who is looked at. The 
          Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
          Allaah be upon him) was not referring to how women should dress; all 
          he was referring to was the ‘awrah. He did not say that women’s dress 
          may cover only the area between the navel and the knee, as these women 
          mistakenly think.
 With regard to mahrams, they may see as much as another 
          woman may see, i.e., it is permissible for a woman to uncover in front 
          of a mahram what she uncovers in front of other women, so she may uncover 
          her head, neck, feet, hands, forearms, calves, etc, but she should not 
          wear short clothes.","From the Fatwas of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn ‘Uthaymeen for al-Daw’ah magazine, issue # 1765, page 55"

Allah created man and caused him to dwell on this earth, but He did not forsake him. Rather He gave him what he needs of food, drink and clothing, and revealed to him throughout the ages a path to follow and be guided by. The interests and happiness of mankind at every time and in every place depend upon following the path of Allah and rejecting all others:
“And verily, this (i.e. Allah's Commandments mentioned in the above two Verses 151 and 152) is My straight path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His path. This He has ordained for you that you may become Al-Muttaqun (the pious)” [al-An'am 6:153 – interpretation of the meaning]
Islam is the last of the heavenly religions and the Quran is the last of the heavenly Books. Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the last of the Prophets and Messengers. Allah commanded him to convey this religion to all of mankind:
“this Quran has been revealed to me that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach.” [al-An’am 6:18]
Allah sent His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with Islam to all of mankind, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah'”[al-A'raf 7:158]
Da’wah is the best of deeds
Da’wah or calling others to Islam is the best of deeds, because it involves guiding people to the Straight Path and to that which will bring them happiness in this world and in the Hereafter:
“And who is better in speech than he who [says: ‘My Lord is Allah (believes in His Oneness),’ and then stands firm (acts upon His Order), and] invites (men) to Allah’s (Islamic Monotheism), and does righteous deeds, and says: ‘I am one of the Muslims.’”[Fussilat 41:33 – interpretation of the meaning]
Da’wah: The mission of prophets and messengers
Calling others to Islam is an honourable mission. This is the work of the prophets and messengers. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained that his mission in life, and the mission of his followers, is to call people to Allah . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘This is my way; I invite unto Allah (i.e. to the Oneness of Allah — Islamic Monotheism) with sure knowledge , I and whosoever follows me (also must invite others to Allah, i.e. to the Oneness of Allah — Islamic Monotheism with sure knowledge). And Glorified and Exalted be Allah (above all that they associate as partners with Him). And I am not of the Mushrikun (polytheists, pagans, idolaters and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah; those who worship others along with Allah or set up rivals or partners to Allah)’.”[Yusuf 12:108]
Muslims are commanded to call people to Islam
The Muslims in general and the scholars in particular are commanded to call people to Islam , as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is good (Islam), enjoining Al-Ma‘ruf (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and forbidding Al-Munkar (polytheism and disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden). And it is they who are the successful'' [Aal 'Imran 3:104]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Convey from me even if it is (only) one ayah.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3461)
What is da’wah?
Calling people to Allah is an important task and a glorious mission, because it means calling people to worship Allah Alone. It means bringing them forth from darkness to the light, planting goodness in the place of evil and truth in the place of falsehood. 
Conditions of da’wah
Hence whoever does this needs to have knowledge, understanding, patience, forbearance, gentleness and kindness. He needs to give of his wealth and of himself, and he needs to understand people’s circumstances and habits. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Invite (mankind, O Muhammad) to the way of your Lord (i.e. Islam) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Quran) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better. Truly, your Lord knows best who has gone astray from His path, and He is the Best Aware of those who are guided.” [al-Nahl 16:125]
Allah blessed His Messenger with the words (interpretation of the meaning):
“And by the Mercy of Allah, you dealt with them gently. And had you been severe and harsh-hearted, they would have broken away from about you; so pass over (their faults), and ask (Allah’s) forgiveness for them; and consult them in the affairs.” [Aal ‘Imran 3:159]
Calling to Islam in the best manner
The da’iyah (caller) may be faced with debates in his da’wah activities, especially with the People of the Book. Allah has commanded us, if it reaches the point of debate, to debate in a manner that is better, which is with kindness and gentleness, explaining the principles of Islam as they came, pure and simple, in a kindly manner and with no element of compulsion. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And argue not with the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), unless it be in (a way) that is better (with good words and in good manner, inviting them to Islamic Monotheism with His Verses), except with such of them as do wrong; and say (to them): ‘We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you; our Ilah (God) and your Ilah (God) is One (i.e. Allah), and to Him we have submitted (as Muslims).’”
[al-‘Ankabut 29:46]
Reward of da’wah
Calling people to Allah is a virtuous deed which brings great reward. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever calls others to guidance will have a reward like the rewards of those who follow him, without that detracting from their reward in any way. And whoever calls others to misguidance will have a burden of sin like the burden of those who follow him, without that detracting from their burden in any way.”(Narrated by Muslim, 2674)
Facing da’wah challenges with patience
If building a physical structure needs effort and patience until it is complete, then building souls and guiding them to the truth also needs patience and sacrifice. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called people to Islam, patiently bearing the persecution of the disbelievers, Jews and hypocrites. They made fun of him and disbelieved in him; they insulted him and threw stones at him; they said that he was a sorcerer or a madman; they accused him of being a poet or a soothsayer – but he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) bore all that with patience until Allah granted him victory and caused His Religion to prevail. So the da’iyah must follow his example:
“So be patient (O Muhammad). Verily, the Promise of Allah is true; and let not those who have no certainty of Faith discourage you from conveying Allah's Message (which you are obliged to convey) [al-Rum 30:60 – interpretation of the meaning]
The Muslims must follow the example and guidance of their Messenger and call others to Islam , bearing insults and harm with patience for the sake of Allah, as their Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did:
“Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day, and remembers Allah much”
[al-Ahzab 33:21 – interpretation of the meaning]
The well-being and happiness of this ummah are only to be found in following this religion. Hence Allah commanded us to convey the message to all of mankind, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“This (Quran) is a Message for mankind (and a clear proof against them), in order that they may be warned thereby, and that they may know that He is the only One Ilah (God — Allah) — (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah) — and that men of understanding may take heed.” [Ibrahim 14:52]

          (cf. al-Toor 52:21, al-Muddaththir 74:38) Whoever believes and does 
          righteous deeds will enter Paradise and whoever disbelieves in Allaah 
          and His Messenger will enter Hell. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
          meaning):  
“Surely, those who disbelieved in 
          Our Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), 
          We shall burn them in Fire. As often as their skins are roasted through, 
          We shall change them for other skins that they may taste the punishment. 
          Truly, Allaah is Ever Most Powerful, All-Wise. 
But those who believe (in the Oneness of Allaah — 
          Islamic Monotheism) and do deeds of righteousness, We shall admit them 
          to Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), abiding therein forever. 
          Therein they shall have Azwaajun Mutahharatun (purified mates or wives), 
          and We shall admit them to shades wide and ever deepening (Paradise)”[al-Nisaa’ 
          4:56-57]  
Righteous deeds benefit the one who does them, 
          for Allaah has no need of us. And evil deeds only harm the one who does 
          them, for they do not harm Allaah at all, Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning):  
“Whosoever does righteous good deed, 
          it is for (the benefit of) his ownself; and whosoever does evil, it 
          is against his ownself. And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) 
          slaves”[Fussilat 41:46] 
 And He says (interpretation of the meaning):  
          
“And whosoever strives, he strives only for himself. 
          Verily, Allaah stands not in need of any of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, 
          jinn, and all that exists)”[al-‘Ankaboot 29:6]  
Allaah is Generous and multiplies hasanaat 
          (good deeds) as He says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“Whoever brings a good deed (Islamic Monotheism and 
          deeds of obedience to Allaah and His Messenger) shall have ten times 
          the like thereof to his credit, and whoever brings an evil deed (polytheism, 
          disbelief, hypocrisy, and deeds of disobedience to Allaah and His Messenger) 
          shall have only the recompense of the like thereof, and they will not 
          be wronged”[al-An’aam 6:160]  
Righteous deeds such as prayer, zakaah, fasting, 
          Hajj, enjoining what is good, forbidding what is evil, jihaad, reading 
          Qur’aan, etc., are the symbols of Islam, and the reward for all of them 
          is Paradise, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“And whoever does righteous good deeds, male or female, 
          and is a (true) believer [in the Oneness of Allaah (Muslim)], such will 
          enter Paradise and not the least injustice, even to the size of a Naqeera 
          (speck on the back of a date stone), will be done to them”[al-Nisaa’ 
          4:124]  
The punishment for all evil deeds and sins 
          such as oppression, shirk (associating others with Allaah), murder, 
          corruption, arrogance, and other sins is Hell, unless one repents. Allaah 
          says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“And whosoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger (Muhammad), 
          and transgresses His limits, He will cast him into the Fire, to abide 
          therein; and he shall have a disgraceful torment”[al-Nisaa’ 4:14]  
          
Words and deeds, whether they are good or 
          bad, are all recorded with the Lord of the Worlds. Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning):  
“This Our Record speaks about you with truth. Verily, 
          We were recording what you used to do (i.e. Our angels used to record 
          your deeds)” [al-Jaathiyah 45:29]  
Allaah does not accept any deeds except those 
          which are done purely for Allaah in accordance with the guidance of 
          the Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning):  
“So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let 
          him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship 
          of his Lord”[al-Kahf 18:110]  
On the Day of Resurrection, each person will 
          see what he did, acts of obedience or disobedience, good or evil, as 
          Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“That Day mankind will proceed in 
          scattered groups that they may be shown their deeds. 
So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom 
          (or a small ant) shall see it. 
And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of an 
          atom (or a small ant) shall see it”[al-Zalzalah :6-8]  
On the Day of Resurrection, each person will 
          be given his book (record of deeds) and it will be said to him: 
 “Read your book. You yourself are 
          sufficient as a reckoner against you this Day” [al-Israa’ 17:14 
          – interpretation of the meaning] 
 Whoever believed and did righteous deeds 
          will take his book in his right hand in joy, and will enter Paradise, 
          and whoever disobeyed Allaah and His Messenger will take his book in 
          his left hand or from behind his back, and will enter Hell. Allaah says 
          (interpretation of the meaning):  
“Then as for him who will be given 
          his Record in his right hand, 
He surely, will receive an easy reckoning, 
And will return to his family in joy! 
But whosoever is given his Record behind his back, 
          
He will invoke (for his) destruction, 
And he shall enter a blazing Fire, and made to taste 
          its burning” 
[al-Inshiqaaq 84:7-12]  
And there is a great difference between faith 
          and disbelief, obedience and disobedience, the people of Paradise and 
          the people of Hell:  
“Is then he who is a believer like 
          him who is a Faasiq (disbeliever and disobedient to Allaah)? Not equal 
          are they. 
As for those who believe (in the Oneness of Allaah 
            Islamic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, for them are 
          Gardens (Paradise) as an entertainment for what they used to do. 
And as for those who are Faasiqoon (disbelievers and 
          disobedient to Allaah), their abode will be the Fire, every time they 
          wish to get away therefrom, they will be put back thereto, and it will 
          be said to them: ‘Taste you the torment of the Fire which you used to 
          deny’” [al-Sajdah 32:18-20 – interpretation of the meaning]  
          
Allaah states that the believers are the ones who will 
          be the victors, and the disbelievers are the ones who will be the losers, 
          as He says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“By Al-‘Asr (the time). 
Verily, man is in loss, 
Except those who believe (in Islamic Monotheism) and 
          do righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth [i.e. 
          order one another to perform all kinds of good deeds (Al-Ma‘roof) 
          which Allaah has ordained, and abstain from all kinds of sins and evil 
          deeds (Al-Munkar) which Allaah has forbidden], and recommend one 
          another to patience (for the sufferings, harms, and injuries which one 
          may encounter in Allaah’s Cause during preaching His religion of Islamic 
          Monotheism or Jihaad)”[al-‘Asr 103:1-3]

12380,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12380,Belief in Al-Qada wal Qadar (Divine will and decree),What is the status of sabr (patience) in Islam? What should the Muslim bear with patience?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Belief in Al-Qada wal Qadar (Divine will and decree) is one of the pillars of faith. The Muslim’s faith is not complete unless he knows that whatever befalls him could not have missed him, and whatever misses him could not have befallen him. Everything is subject to the will and decree of Allah, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, We have created all things with Qadar (Divine Preordainments of all things before their creation as written in the Book of Decrees Al Lawh Al Mahfooz). [Al-Qamar 54:49] 
The position of patience in relation to faith is like that of the head in relation to the body. Patience is a noble attribute with good consequences. Those who are patient will have an unlimited reward, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Only those who are patient shall receive their reward in full, without reckoning” [Al-Zumar 39:10] 
All the disasters and tribulations that happen on earth, or happen to the individual, or to his wealth or family, etc., were known to Allah before they happened, He has written them in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz (the Preserved Tablet) as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“No calamity befalls on the earth or in yourselves but it is inscribed in the Book of Decrees (Al Lawh Al Mahfooz) before We bring it into existence. Verily, that is easy for Allah” [Al-Hadeed 57:22] 
No matter what disasters befall a person, it is good for him, whether he knows that or not, because Allah does not decree anything but it is good, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say: ‘Nothing shall ever happen to us except what Allah has ordained for us. He is our Mawlaa (Lord, Helper and Protector).’ And in Allah let the believers put their trust”[Al-Tawbah 9:51] 
Every disaster that happens, happens by Allah’s leave. If He had not willed it, it would not have happened, but Allah permitted it to happen and decreed it, and so it happened. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“No calamity befalls, but by the Leave [i.e. Decision and Qadar (Divine Preordainments)] of Allah, and whosoever believes in Allah, He guides his heart [to the true Faith with certainty, i.e. what has befallen him was already written for him by Allah from the Qadar (Divine Preordainments)]. And Allah is the All-Knower of everything”[Al-Taghaabun 64:11] 
Once a person knows that all calamities happen by the will and decree of Allah, then he has to believe and submit and be patient. The reward for patience is Paradise, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And their recompense shall be Paradise, and silken garments, because they were patient”[Al-Insaan 76:12] 
The call to Allah (da’wah) is a great mission, and the one who undertakes it is exposed to a great deal of harm and calamities. Hence Allah enjoined patience upon His Messenger and other Prophets:  
“Therefore be patient (O Muhammad) as did the Messengers of strong will” [Al-Ahqaaf 46:35 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Allah has guided the believers, if some matter worries them or some calamity befalls them to seek help with patience and prayer, so that Allah will relieve their distress and give them a way out: 
“O you who believe! Seek help in patience and As-Salaah (the prayer). Truly, Allah is with As-Saabiroon (the patient)”
[Al-Baqarah 2:153 – interpretation of the meaning] 
The believer must bear with patience that which Allah has decreed, and be patient in obeying Allah, and be patient in keeping away from sin. Whoever is patient, Allah will give him an immeasurable reward on the Day of Resurrection, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“Only those who are patient shall receive their reward in full, without reckoning” [Al-Zumar 39:10] 
The believer in particular is rewarded in both good times and bad. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “How wonderful is the affair of the believer, for all his affairs are good, and that is for no one except the believer. If something good happens to him, he gives thanks, and that is good for him, and if something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience and that is good for him.” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 2999) 
Allah has taught us what we should say when calamity strikes, and has stated that those who are patient will have an honourable position with their Lord. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“… but give glad tidings to As Saabiroon (the patient).
Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: ‘Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return’”[Al-Baqarah 2:155-156]",From Usool al-Deen al-Islami by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem al-Tuwayjri

Hypocrisy means making an outward display of Islam whilst inwardly concealing disbelief.,"What is hypocrisy in Islam?


Characteristics of the hypocrites


Punishment of the hypocrites","Praise be to Allah.What is hypocrisy in Islam?
Hypocrisy in Islam is a serious sickness and a great crime. It means making an outward display of Islam whilst inwardly concealing disbelief. Hypocrisy is more dangerous than disbelief and the punishment for it is more severe, because it is disbelief mixed with Islam and its harmful effects are greater. Hence Allah will put the hypocrites in the lowest level of Hell, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
{Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth (grade) of the Fire; no helper will you find for them.} [Al-Nisa 4:145] 
The hypocrites are always confused, always planning deceit and plots. Although outwardly they appear to be with the believers, inwardly they are with the disbelievers. So sometimes they are inclined towards the believers and sometimes they are inclined towards the disbelievers. 
{(They are) swaying between this and that, belonging neither to these nor to those; and he whom Allah sends astray, you will not find for him a way (to the truth — Islam)} [al-Nisa 4:143 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Because of the corruption of their hearts, the hypocrites are the most averse of mankind to the religion of Allah, as Allah tells us about them (interpretation of the meaning): 
{And when it is said to them: ‘Come to what Allah has sent down and to the Messenger (Muhammad),’ you (Muhammad) see the hypocrites turn away from you (Muhammad) with aversion} [al-Nisa 4:61] 
The dealings of the hypocrites revolve around their own interests. When they meet the believers, they make a show of belief and loyalty, in order to deceive the believers and as an action of dissimulation, hoping for whatever good and war-booty they have. But when they meet their masters and chiefs, they say, we are with you in your shirk and kufr. Allah says concerning them (interpretation of the meaning): 
{And when they meet those who believe, they say: “We believe,” but when they are alone with their Shayatin (devils — polytheists, hypocrites), they say: “Truly, we are with you; verily, we were but mocking
Allah mocks at them and gives them increase in their wrong-doing to wander blindly} [al-Baqarah 2:14-15] 
Characteristics of the hypocrites

The hypocrites have many characteristics, the worst and most serious of which is disbelief in Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

{And when it is said to them (hypocrites): ‘Believe as the people (followers of Muhammad, Al-Ansar and Al-Muhajirun) have believed,’ they say: ‘Shall we believe as the fools have believed?’ Verily, they are the fools, but they know not} [al-Baqarah 2:13]

Among their characteristics are enmity and envy (hasad) towards the believers, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

{If good befalls you (O Muhammad), it grieves them, but if a calamity overtakes you, they say: ‘We took our precaution beforehand’ and they turn away rejoicing} [al-Tawbah 9:50]

Among their characteristics is mockery of Allah, His Messenger and His religion. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

{If you ask them (about this), they declare: ‘We were only talking idly and joking.’ Say: ‘Was it at Allah, and His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger that you were mocking?’
Make no excuse; you disbelieved after you had believed} [al-Tawbah 9:65-66] 

Among their characteristics is that they spread corruption on earth, with disbelief, hypocrisy and sins. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

{And when it is said to them: ‘Make not mischief on the earth,’ they say: ‘We are only peacemakers.’
Verily, they are the ones who make mischief, but they perceive not} [al-Baqarah 2:11-12]

Among their characteristics are slander and lies. Allah tells us about them (interpretation of the meaning): 

{They swear by Allah that they are truly of you while they are not of you, but they are a people (hypocrites) who are afraid (that you may kill them)} [al-Tawbah 9:56] 

Among their characteristics is that they enjoin what is evil and forbid what is good, and they are stingy with their wealth. Allah says concerning them (interpretation of the meaning): 

{The hypocrites , men and women, are one from another; they enjoin (on the people) Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief and polytheism of all kinds and all that Islam has forbidden), and forbid (people) from Al-Ma‘ruf (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and they close their hands [from giving (spending in Allah’s Cause) alms]. They have forgotten Allah, so He has forgotten them. Verily, the hypocrites are the Fasiqun (rebellious, disobedient to Allah)} [al-Tawbah 9:67] 

Among their characteristics are greed and avarice: 

{And of them are some who accuse you (O Muhammad) in the matter of (the distribution of) the alms. If they are given part thereof, they are pleased, but if they are not given thereof, behold! They are enraged!} [al-Tawbah 9: 58 – interpretation of the meaning] 

Among their characteristics are those which were described by the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): 

“There are four (characteristics), whoever has all of them is a complete hypocrite, and whoever has some of them has some element of hypocrisy , unless he gives it up: when he speaks, he lies; when he makes a treaty, he betrays it; when he makes a promise, he breaks it; when he quarrels, he resorts to insults.” (Narrated by Muslim, 53) 

Among their characteristics is a concern with appearances and fancy speech whilst they are inwardly corrupt. Allah says concerning them (interpretation of the meaning): 

{And when you look at them, their bodies please you; and when they speak, you listen to their words. They are as blocks of wood propped up. They think that every cry is against them. They are the enemies, so beware of them. May Allah curse them! How are they denying (or deviating from) the Right Path?} [al-Munafiqun 63:4] 
If the disbelievers are obvious enemies from without, then the hypocrites are hidden enemies from within. They are more harmful and more dangerous to the Muslims, because they mix with them and know their situation. Allah has decreed that the ultimate destiny of the disbelievers and hypocrites will be in Hell: 
{Surely, Allah will collect the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell} [al-Nisa 4:140 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Punishment of the hypocrites
But because of the seriousness of the harm they cause, the hypocrites will be in the lowest level of Hell, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
{Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth (grade) of the Fire} [al-Nisa 4:145] 
Because the danger posed to the Muslim ummah by the disbelievers and hypocrites is so great, Allah commanded His Messenger to strive against them: 
{O Prophet (Muhammad)! Strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be severe against them; their abode will be Hell, and worst indeed is that destination} [al-Tahrim 66:9 – interpretation of the meaning]

12390,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12390,Judging by that which Allaah has revealed,"Can one who judges by something other than that which Allaah has revealed be regarded as just, if he does not wrong people?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Muslim ummah is one nation, with one ‘aqeedah 
          (belief) and one sharee’ah (law). Because every flock needs a shepherd 
          and every nation needs a leader to guide them to goodness and ward off 
          evil from them, Islam enjoins the appointment of a ruler over the ummah, 
          who is to be elected by the Muslims, to rule them according to the Book 
          of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah   
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).  
Allaah sent His Messenger of establish the 
          laws of Allaah and to judge with truth and justice, as Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning):  
“O Dawood (David)! Verily, We have placed you as a 
          successor on the earth; so judge you between men in truth (and justice) 
          and follow not your desire   for it will mislead you from the 
          path of Allaah. Verily, those who wander astray from the path of Allaah 
          (shall) have a severe torment, because they forgot the Day of Reckoning[Saad 
          38:26]  
The mission of the ruler is to rule the Muslims 
          according to the Qur’aan and Sunnah, to spread justice among the entire 
          ummah, to carry out the hudood punishments, to spread Islam, to protect 
          the ummah and to engage in jihaad for the sake of Allaah. Allaah says 
          (interpretation of the meaning):  
“Verily, Allaah commands that you should render back 
          the trusts to those, to whom they are due; and that when you judge between 
          men, you judge with justice. Verily, how excellent is the teaching which 
          He (Allaah) gives you!”[al-Nisaa’ 4:58]  
Justice is one of the most important principles 
          of Islam, which applies both to Muslims and others:  
“and let not the enmity and hatred 
          of others make you avoid justice. Be just: that is nearer to piety” 
          
[al-Maa'idah 5:8 – interpretation of the meaning]  
          
The ruler of the Muslims is responsible for 
          his flock. He has to rule them in accordance with the laws of Allaah, 
          check on their situation, and lead them to that which will bring them 
          happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:  
“Each of you is a shepherd and is responsible 
          for his flock. The ruler who is (appointed) over the people is a shepherd 
          and is responsible for his flock…” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 1829)  
          
Allaah created mankind, sent down revelation 
          to them, and sent the Messengers to them to judge them by that which 
          Allaah has revealed. Whoever does not judge by that which Allaah has 
          revealed is a kaafir, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
          
“And whosoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, 
          such are the Kaafiroon (i.e. disbelievers — of a lesser degree as they 
          do not act on Allaah’s Law)”[al-Maa'idah 5:44]  
If the ruler judges according to the Book 
          of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), it becomes obligatory to 
          obey him and haraam to go against him or to rebel against him. Allaah 
          says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger 
          (Muhammad), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if 
          you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allaah and His 
          Messenger, if you believe in Allaah and in the Last Day. That is better 
          and more suitable for final determination”[al-Nisaa’ 4:59]  
          
If the ruler judges by something other than 
          that which Allaah has revealed, or he enjoins disobedience to Allaah, 
          then we should not hear and obey. The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:   
“The Muslim is obliged to hear and obey whether 
          he likes it or dislikes it, unless he is commanded to disobey (Allaah), 
          in which case he should not hear and obey.”(Narrated by Muslim, 1839)  
          
The ruler is entrusted with the affairs of 
          the ummah; he must rule them according to the laws of Allaah, and be 
          kind and sincere towards them. If he does not do that, then he must 
          be advised. If he does not respond (to that advice), the Muslims should 
          choose another ruler from among those who are both pious and strong.  
          
The just Muslim ruler will have great virtue 
          and an honourable status on the Day of Resurrection. The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:  
“The just will be with Allaah on thrones of 
          light on the right hand of the Most Merciful, and both His hands are 
          right hands – those who are just in their rulings and are fair with 
          their families and those of whom they are in charge.”(Narrated by Muslim, 
          1827)  
If the ruler oppresses or cheats his flock 
          and is not sincere towards them, Allaah will deprive him of Paradise. 
          The Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) said:  
“There is no person whom Allaah has placed 
          in charge of others, who dies whilst he is insincere towards his people, 
          but Allaah will forbid him Paradise.”(Narrated by Muslim, 142)  
          
And he  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:  
“There is no Muslim ruler who is put in charge 
          of the Muslims’ affairs then he does not strive on their behalf or act 
          sincerely towards them, but he will not enter Paradise with them.” (Narrated 
          by Muslim, Kitaab al-Imaarah, 22).  
Islam is the way for all of the ummah, so 
          all of the individual members are equal in that they should – indeed 
          must – follow its guidance, act in accordance with its teachings, calling 
          call others to Islam and strive in jihaad for the sake of Islam.  
          
Allaah warns everyone who fights against the 
          religion of Allaah or fights those who speak the word of truth in the 
          houses of Allaah, that He will put them to shame in this world and punish 
          them in the Hereafter. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
          
“And who are more unjust than those who forbid that 
          Allaah’s Name be glorified and mentioned much (i.e. prayers and invocations) 
          in Allaah’s mosques and strive for their ruin? It was not fitting that 
          such should themselves enter them (Allaah’s mosques) except in fear. 
          For them there is disgrace in this world, and they will have a great 
          torment in the Hereafter[al-Baqarah 2:114]   
Everyone who entices the Muslims away from their 
          religion, persecutes them or humiliates them will be in Hell if he dies 
          without having repented. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
          
“Verily, those who put into trial 
          the believing men and believing women (by torturing them and burning 
          them), and then do not turn in repentance (to Allaah), then they will 
          have the torment of Hell, and they will have the punishment of the burning 
          Fire” 
[al-Burooj 85:10]  
Openly proclaiming the word of truth is an 
          obligation upon every Muslim at every time and in every place. Allaah 
          commanded His Messenger to proclaim the truth, and He guaranteed to 
          protect him from his enemies. Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): 
          
“Therefore proclaim openly (Allaah’s 
          Message   Islamic Monotheism) that which you are commanded, and 
          turn away from Al‑Mushrikoon (polytheists, idolaters, and disbelievers). 
          
Truly, We will suffice you against the scoffers”[al-Hijr 
          15:94-95] 
 The greatest jihaad is to speak the 
          truth before an unjust ruler.  
In both the general and the specific sense, 
          the judge will be rewarded, if he is knowledgeable and is able to make 
          ijtihaad. If he passes a judgement and makes the right decision, he 
          will have two rewards, one for his ijtihaad and one for being right. 
          If he passes a judgement and makes a mistake, he will have one reward, 
          that for his ijtihaad. The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:  
“If the judge passes a judgement and makes 
          ijtihaad and is right, he will have two rewards. If he passes a judgement and makes ijtihaad, and makes a mistake, he will have one reward.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1716)",From Usool al-Deen al-Islami by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem al-Tuwayjri
12391,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12391,The most honoured of you with Allaah is the one who is the most pious,What does Islam say about racial discrimination?,,,"Praise be to Allah.All people are the descendants of one man 
          and one woman, believer and kaafir, black and white, Arab and non-Arab, 
          rich and poor, noble and lowly.  
Islam does not pay attention to differences 
          in colour, race or lineage. All people come from Adam, and Adam was 
          created from dust. In Islam, differentiation between people is based 
          on faith (eemaan) and piety (taqwaa), by doing that which Allaah has 
          enjoined and avoiding that which Allaah has prohibited. Allaah says 
          (interpretation of the meaning):  
“O mankind! We have created you 
          from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that 
          you may know one another. Verily, the most honourable of you with Allaah 
          is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa [i.e. he is one of the Muttaqoon 
          (the pious)]. Verily, Allaah is All-Knowing, All Aware” 
[al-Hujuraat 49:13]  
Islam regards all people as equal as far as 
          rights and duties are concerned People are equal before the law (sharee’ah), 
          as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“Whoever works righteousness — whether male or female 
          — while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, 
          to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment 
          and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion 
          to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter)” 
          [al-Nahl 16:97]  
Faith, truthfulness and piety all lead to 
          Paradise, which is the right of the one who acquires these attributes, 
          even if he is one of the weakest or lowliest of people. Allaah says 
          (interpretation of the meaning):  
“And whosoever believes in Allaah and performs righteous 
          good deeds, He will admit him into Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise) 
          to dwell therein forever. Allaah has indeed granted for him an excellent 
          provision” [al-Talaaq 65:11]  
Kufr, arrogance and oppression all lead to 
          Hell, even if the one who does these things is one of the richest or 
          noblest of people. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
          
“But those who disbelieved (in the Oneness of Allaah 
          – Islamic Monotheism) and denied Our Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, 
          lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they will be the dwellers of the 
          Fire, to dwell therein forever. And worst indeed is that destination” 
          [al-Taghaabun 64:10]  
The advisors of the Messenger  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) included Muslim men of all 
          tribes, races and colours. Their hearts were filled with Tawheed and 
          they were brought together by their faith and piety – such as Abu Bakr 
          from Quraysh, ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib from Bani Haashim, Bilaal the Ethiopian, 
          Suhayb the Roman, Salmaan the Persian, rich men like ‘Uthmaan and poor 
          men like ‘Ammaar, people of means and poor people like Ahl al-Suffah, 
          and others.  
They believed in Allaah and strove for His 
          sake, until Allaah and His Messenger were pleased with them. They were 
          the true believers.  
“Their reward with their Lord is 
          ‘Adn (Eden) Paradise (Gardens of Eternity), underneath which rivers 
          flow. They will abide therein forever, Allaah will be pleased with them, 
          and they with Him. That is for him who fears his Lord”

12397,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12397,Retirement lump sum for a bank employee,"One of our friends is asking about his father who works in a interest-based bank and is about to retire. He will be given a lump sum at the end of his career from the money of this interest-based bank. What is the ruling on this lump sum? What is the ruling on the pension that he will receive after retirement? (Please note that the retirement pension will be paid to him monthly from the social security fund, which is a body which receives payments made by the employer – the bank in this case – and compulsory deductions from the employee towards the pension).",,,"Praise be to Allah.Our 
          shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked 
          about the payment of a lump sum upon redundancy for an employee of a 
          interest-based bank. He replied that it is permissible for him to take 
          something in return for the period that he worked in the riba-based 
          bank before he knew that it was haraam, and that it is not permissible 
          for him to take anything for the period when he worked and was aware 
          of the prohibition.  
For 
          example, if we suppose that he worked for 30 years in the bank, and 
          he did not know for 20 years that his work was haraam, then he came 
          to know of the ruling, but he continued to work for another 10 years, 
          then he may take (a lump sum) in return for the twenty years, but not 
          for the last ten years.  
With 
          regard to his children, it is permissible for them to take what they 
          need from their father even if his earnings are haraam, because his 
          spending on them is obligatory, and the sin is on him only. But they 
          should advise him and not take too much. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
