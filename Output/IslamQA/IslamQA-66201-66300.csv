Interpretation of hadith about eating during adhan in Ramadan","Praise be to Allah.Hadith about eating during adhan in Ramadan
The hadith mentioned in the question was not narrated in that wording. The wording of the hadith is: 
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If one of you hears the call (to prayer) and the vessel is still in his hand, let him not put it down until he finished with it.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 10251; Abu Dawud. 2350; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud. We will discuss its meaning according to the scholars below.)
Beginning and end of fasting in Ramadan
It is obligatory for the fasting person to refrain from things which break the fast from the true dawn until the sun sets.  What this means is when dawn breaks, not the adhan. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night).” [al-Baqarah 2:187]
So when a person becomes certain that the true dawn has come, he has to stop eating and drinking, and if there is food in his mouth he has to spit it out; if he does not do that, then he has invalidated his fast.
But if a person is not certain that dawn has come, he may eat until he is certain. The same applies if he knows that the muadhdhin gives the call before the time comes, or if he is not sure whether he gives the call on time or ahead of time: he may eat until he is certain. But it is better for him to stop eating as soon as he hears the adhan. 
Interpretation of hadith about eating during adhan in Ramadan
With regard to the hadith mentioned above, the scholars interpreted it as referring to a muadhdhin who gives the call to prayer before dawn breaks. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmu’ 6/333: 
“We have stated that if dawn breaks and a person has food in his mouth, he should spit it out and complete his fast. If he swallows it after knowing that dawn has come, his fast is invalidated. There is no difference of scholarly opinion on this point. The evidence for that is the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar and ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with them both), according to which that Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Bilal gives the call to prayer at night, so eat and drink until Ibn Umm Maktum gives the call to prayer.” Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim. There are many ahadith in al-Sahih with similar meanings. 
With regard to the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If one of you hears the call (to prayer) and the vessel is still in his hand, let him not put it down until he has finished with it” – and according to another version he said: the muadhdhin used to give the call to prayer when dawn broke – al-Hakim Abu ‘Abd-Allah narrated the first version, and said: This is sahih according to the conditions of Muslim. Both were narrated by al-Bayhaqi, who said: If this is sahih, it is understood by the majority of scholars as meaning that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) knew that he used to give the call to prayer before dawn came, thus the eating and drinking referred to were taking place just before dawn came.  
The phrase “when dawn broke” is understood to be the words of someone other than Abu Hurayrah, or it may be describing the second adhan, in which case the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – “If one of you hears the call (to prayer) and the vessel is still in his hand” – refer to the first call to prayer, so that it is in accordance with the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar and ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with them). He said: Thus the reports are in agreement. And Allah is the Source of strength, and Allah knows best.”
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) stated in Tahdhib al-Sunan that some of the salaf followed the apparent meaning of the hadith mentioned in the question, and they regarded it as permissible to eat and drink after hearing the adhan of Fajr . Then he said:
“But the majority are of the view that sahoor should stop when dawn breaks . This is the view of the four imams, and the majority of fuqaha of the regions, and was also narrated from ‘Umar and Ibn ‘Abbas. The former quoted as evidence the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “… so eat and drink until Ibn Umm Maktum gives the call to prayer, for he does not give the call until dawn breaks.” 
It is narrated thus in al-Bukhari; in some versions it says: “… and he was a blind man who did not give the call to prayer until it was said to him: Dawn has come, dawn has come.” 
The majority quoted as evidence the words of Allah: “and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night)” [al-Baqarah 2:187], and the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Eat and drink until Ibn Umm Maktum gives the call to prayer,” and his words, “There are two dawns. 
The first one does not make it haram to eat or make it permissible to pray, but the second makes it haram to eat and permissible to pray.” Narrated by al-Bayhaqi in his Sunan.” 
Reports were narrated from some of the Salaf which indicate that it is permissible for a fasting person to eat until dawn breaks. Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated a large number of such reports, including the report that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab used to say: “If two men are uncertain about dawn let them eat until they are certain.” 
Ibn 'Abbas said: “Allah has permitted drinking so long as you are uncertain, i.e., about the dawn.” 
Makhul said: I saw Ibn ‘Umar take a bucket of Zamzam water and say to two men, “Has dawn come?” One of them said: “It has come,” and the other said, “No (it hasn’t),” so Ibn ‘Umar drank (the water). 
Ibn Hazm said, commenting on the hadith asked about here and a number of similar reports: “All of this refers to cases when they are not yet certain that dawn has come. Thus the Sunnahs are in accordance with the Quran.” (Al-Muhalla, 4/367)
Undoubtedly most of the muadhdhins nowadays rely on clocks and timetables, not on sighting the dawn. This cannot be regarded as certainty that dawn has come. Whoever eats in this case, his fast is valid, because he was not certain that dawn had come, but it is better and safer to stop eating. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on the fast of one who hears the adhan of Fajr but continues eating and drinking? 
He replied: 
“What the believer must do is to abstain from things that break the fast, eating and drinking etc., when it becomes clear to him that dawn has broken, if the fast is an obligatory one such as in Ramadan and fasts in fulfillment of vows or as an act of expiation, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night).” [al-Baqarah 2:187]
If he hears the adhan and knows that this is the call for Fajr prayer, he must stop eating. If the muadhdhin gives the call to prayer before dawn breaks, then he does not have to stop eating, and it is permissible for him to eat and drink until it is clear to him that dawn has come. 
If he doesn't know whether the muadhdhin gives the call to prayer before or after dawn, then it is better and safer for him to stop eating when he hears the adhan, but it does not matter if he drinks or eats something during the adhan because he does not know whether dawn has broken. 
It is well known that those who live in cities where there are electrical lights cannot know whether dawn has come at the time when it breaks, but they can follow the adhan and timetables which give the time of dawn, hour and minute, in accordance with the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt.” And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever avoids doubtful matters will have protected his religious commitment and honour.”  And Allah is the Source of strength.” (Fatawa Ramadan, compiled by Ashraf ‘Abd al-Maqsud, p. 201)
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: You said that we must stop eating when we hear the adhan, but a few years ago they did not stop eating until the end of the adhan. What is the ruling on that action of theirs? 
He replied: 
“The adhan for Fajr prayer may be given either after dawn breaks or before. If it is given after dawn breaks, then one must stop eating as soon as he hears the call, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Bilal gives the call to prayer at night, so eat and drink until Ibn Umm Maktum gives the call to prayer, for he does not give the call until dawn has broken.” If you know that this muadhdhin does not give the call to prayer until dawn has broken, then stop as soon as you hear him. But if the muadhdhin gives the call based on a timetable he follows, or based on his watch, then the matter is less serious. 
Based on this, we say to this questioner: You do not have to make up what is past, because you were not certain whether you ate after dawn had broken. But in the future you should be careful; when you hear the muadhdhin, stop eating.” (Fatawa Ramadan, p. 204) 
And the Shaykh said, pointing out what is said about timetables being inaccurate: 
“Because some people nowadays are uncertain about the timetables that people have, and they say that they give the time of dawn too early, we went out into the desert with no lights around us, and we saw that the dawn came later, and some people exaggerated and suggested that the dawn comes twenty minutes later.  
But it seems that this exaggeration is not correct. What we think is that the timetables that people have nowadays give the time of dawn in particular as five minutes early, so if you eat whilst the muadhdhin is giving the adhan according to the timetable, it doesn’t matter. Some muadhdhins, may Allah reward them with good, give the adhan five minutes later than the time given in the timetables as they exist at present, as a precaution, but some ignorant muadhdhins give the adhan for Fajr early, claiming that this is on the safe side with regard to the fast, but they forget that they are being careless with regard to something that is more important than the fast, namely Fajr prayer. So people may end up praying ahead of time based on their adhan. If a person offers a prayer ahead of its time, even if he says the opening takbir, his prayer is not valid.” (Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him), vol 19, question no. 772)

66219,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66219,Should he follow the local people with regard to starting and ending the fast?,"The sighting of the moon in my country was delayed by two days, and there is a group of people who follow the general sighting and fast with Saudi and other neighbouring lands. I started to follow this group this year and I fasted one day before my country. Do I have to make up the fast, knowing that the sighting here was proved after that? Should I break the fast with my country or when the moon is sighted anywhere?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    In the answer to question no. 
    12660 we stated that if the 
    Muslim is in a Muslim country that relies on sighting of the moon to mark 
    the beginning and end of the month, then he must follow that country, and it 
    is not permissible for him to differ from it in starting and ending the 
    fast. 

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “The fast is the day when you fast, breaking the fast is the day when 
    you break the fast, and sacrifice is the day when you offer the sacrifice.” 
    Narrated by Abu Dawood (2324) and al-Tirmidhi (697); classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.

    The imams differed with regard to the question of whether, if 
    the moon is sighted in one place, all the Muslims are obliged to fast, or 
    are only the nearby countries obliged to fast and not the distant countries, 
    or are those whose sighting coincides with that sighting obliged to fast, 
    and not those whose sighting did not coincide with it? There are several 
    opinions.

    The Muslim should follow the scholars of his own country in 
    whichever of these views they believe to be more correct, based on the 
    evidence that they have available, and he should not start or end the fast 
    on his own. 

    We have quoted the statement of the Council of Senior 
    Scholars on this issue in the answer to question no. 
    50487, in which they 
    said: 

    … the members of the Council of Senior Scholars think that 
    matters should be left as they are and that this subject should not be 
    stirred up. Each Islamic state should have the right to choose whichever 
    opinion it wishes, based on the suggestions of its own scholars, because 
    each view has its evidence and proofs. 

    Please read this statement in full, because it is important. 

    Based on this, you should follow your country which relies on 
    the sighting of the moon to establish the beginning and end of the month and 
    the beginning and end of the fast. If you do that, you will have done well 
    and you are not required to make up the fast.

66225,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66225,They receive instructions to preach about national holidays in their khutbahs – what should they do?,"I am the imam in a mosque, and sometimes we receive instructions from the Ministry telling us to promote national holidays such as the holiday commemorating the conqueror, which will coincide with the date of the battle of Badr. We are ordered to speak about this occasion and the daa’iyahs are confused about these instructions. If they go ahead and do that, that will have a negative effect on their da’wah and make the people think badly of them and they will have doubts about what they are doing. Please note also that the department that is responsible for that will punish the imam who refuses to speak about national holidays.

 My question is: How should we deal with such matters, especially on the occasions mentioned?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly:  

    There is nothing wrong with the khateeb speaking about the 
    battle of Badr or Uhud, or any other battle, and describing what happened on 
    such occasions at the time of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him). This is not regarded as celebrating it or introducing a 
    festival that is not prescribed in Islam, because it is simply reminding the 
    people of that battle and, more importantly, deriving useful lessons from 
    it. 

    Secondly: 

    With regard to national holidays, if the people celebrate 
    them and take them as a kind of ‘Eid, then the khateeb should not take any 
    part in that, and speaking about such occasions may be understood by the 
    listener as meaning that he is joining in and supporting this innovation. 

    But if the Ministry will punish those who do not speak about 
    these occasions, by preventing them from delivering khutbahs or other 
    penalties, then the khateeb should weigh up the pros and cons, and decide 
    whether the interests served by his remaining as a teacher, daa’iyah and 
    guide will be outweighed by the negative consequences of a speech which may 
    damage his reputation among the common folk, or not. 

    It seems that the wise khateeb can use these occasions in 
    order to say something useful that will reinforce the ideas of the causes of 
    victory and the factors that lead to defeat, the laws of Allaah with regard 
    to the rise and fall of societies, and the concept of al-wala’ wa’l-bara’ 
    (loyalty towards the believers and disavowal of the disbelievers), the 
    necessity of turning back to Islam, and other important concepts which the 
    people need to know. 

    In this way, the interests served by his speech will be many 
    times greater than the negative consequences referred to. Islam seeks to 
    bring and fulfil what is in people’s interests and to ward off and reduce 
    harmful effects, by choosing the lesser of two evils, as is well known.

66227,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66227,Are Drugs Haram?,"In recent times the phenomenon of drug-taking has increased, especially hashish, because the people think that it is not khamr that befogs the mind.
 My question is – is it really khamr (an intoxicant)? If a person drinks khamr, will his prayer not be accepted for forty days? In that case, how valid is the fasting of one who smokes hashish during Ramadan?","No wise person would doubt that drugs are haram, because of the textual evidence that points to their prohibition, and because of the extensive harm that they cause.","Are drugs haram?


Why are drugs haram?


Punishment for taking drugs


Will the prayer of drug-addicts be accepted?","Praise be to Allah.Are drugs haram?
There is no doubt that taking drugs is haram, including hashish, opium, cocaine, morphine, and so on. 
Why are drugs haram?
Drugs are haram for many reasons, including the following: 

Drugs dull the senses and befog the mind, and whatever does that is haram. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every intoxicant is khamr, and every intoxicant is haram. Whoever drinks khamr in this world and dies persisting in that and without having repented, will not drink it in the Hereafter.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2003) 

Al-Bukhari (4087) and Muslim (1733) narrated that Abu Musa said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent Mu’adh ibn Jabal and me to Yemen, and I said: O Messenger of Allah, there is a drink that is made in our land and is called al-mizr, which is made from barley, and another drink called al-bit’, which is made from honey. He said: “Every intoxicant is haram.” 
Al-Bukhari (4343) and Muslim (3032) narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) say from the minbar of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “O people, the prohibition of khamr was revealed when khamr was made from five things: grapes, dates, honey, wheat and barley. Khamr is whatever befogs the mind.” 
There is no doubt that drugs also befog the mind and take away reason. 
Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar said: The general meaning of the words, “Every intoxicant is haram,” is taken as evidence that whatever causes intoxication is haram, even if it is not a drink. So that includes hashish and other things. Al-Nawawi and others were certain that it is an intoxicant, and others were certain that it dulls the senses, and it is arrogant to say otherwise, because its visible effects are the same as those of khamr, such as euphoria and addiction. 
Even if we assume that it is not an intoxicant, it is proven in Abu Dawud that all intoxicants and relaxants are haram. And Allah knows best. End quote from Fath al-Bari, 10/45. 
Al-Khattabi said: Relaxants are those drinks that cause relaxation in the muscles and numbness in the extremities, which is the precursor to intoxication . It is forbidden to drink them lest they be a means that leads to intoxication. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Everything that takes away one's senses is haram, even if it does not result in drunkenness or intoxication. If it takes away the senses it is haram according to the consensus of the Muslims. With regard to using banj (lit. henbane) which does not cause intoxication or take away reason, this is subject to a ta'zir punishment.  
The scholars who studied the issue realized that hashish is an intoxicant, and that it is only consumed by evildoers, because of the pleasure and euphoria it brings. So it is like intoxicating drinks. Khamr makes a person lively and argumentative, whereas hashish makes him relaxed and lethargic, but it still befogs the mind and opens the door to physical desires and  heedlessness with regard to one's honour, which makes it worse than intoxicating drinks. This is something that was introduced by the Tatars. 
The one who consumes a little or a lot of it is to be subjected to the punishment for drinking: eighty or forty lashes, if he is a Muslim who believes that intoxicants are haram. End quote from al-Fatawa al-Kubra, 3/423 
It says in al-Siyasah al-Shar'iyyah (p. 92): 
“Hashish which is made from grape leaves is also haram and the one who does that should be whipped as the drinker of khamr is whipped. It is worse than khamr in a way, because it corrupts the mind and mood, and robs a man of his masculinity and makes him heedless about his honour, and other evil consequences. But khamr is worse in another way, because it leads to arguments and fights. Both of them keep a person from remembering Allah and praying. Some of the later fuqaha did not issue rulings on the punishment for it, and they thought that the one who consumes it should be given a ta'zir punishment that is less severe than the hadd punishment, because they thought that it alters the mind without causing euphoria, like banj (henbane). We have not found any comment on it among the earlier scholars, but that is not correct, rather those who consume it become addicted to it like those who drink khamr, if not more so, and it keeps them from remembering Allah and praying if they consume a great deal of it. It also causes other evil results such as heedlessness about one's honour and loss of masculinity, corruption of one's mind and mood, and so on. Because it is something solid and edible, and it is not a drink, the scholars disagreed as to whether it is najis (impure) and there are three opinions in the madhhab of Ahmad and elsewhere. It was said that it is najis like khamr that is drunk – this is the correct view; and it was said that it is not najis because of its solid state, and it was said that a differentiation should be made between its solid and liquid forms. 
Whatever the case, it comes under the heading of that which Allah has forbidden of khamr and intoxicants, whether by name or by nature. Abu Musa al-Ash’ari (may Allah be pleased with him) said: O Messenger of Allah, advise us with regard to two drinks that we used to make in Yemen: al-bit’ which is made of honey that is soaked until it becomes strong, and al-mizr which is made of wheat and barley until it becomes strong. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had been given the gift of comprehensive and concise speech and he said: “Every intoxicant is haram.” Agreed upon in al-Sahihayn.” 
He also said: “How about the person who persists in consuming hashish, especially if he believes that it is permissible, as some people do? Such a person should be asked to repent ; if he repents, all well and good, otherwise he should be executed, because intoxicants are haram according to scholarly consensus, and regarding them as permitted is undoubtedly kufr.” (Al-Fatawa al-Kubra, 2/309) 

Drugs cause a great deal of harm, which may be greater than the harm caused by drinking alcohol. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm.” (Narrated by Ahmad and Ibn Majah (2341); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah.) 

They cause harm to the person himself, to his family and children, and to his society and nation. 
With regard to the personal harm caused, they cause serious harm to both the body and the mind, because intoxicants and drugs destroy the health, nerves, mind, reasoning, the digestive system, and other negative effects which impact the entire body, and it damages his dignity and honour, as his personality becomes fragile, and he becomes a laughing-stock and suffers from numerous diseases. 
With regard to the harm that is caused to the family, this is the mistreatment of his wife and children, so the house is turned into an unbearable hell because of tension, anger, arguments, insults, repeated utterance of divorce (talaq), breaking of things, neglect of the wife, and not spending properly on the home. Intoxicants and drugs may even lead to the birth of children who are deformed or mentally handicapped. 
The harm that is caused to society is evident in the huge destruction of wealth with no positive return, which affects the man’s interests and leads to the failure to fulfil duties and loss of public trusts, whether that has to do with the interests of the state, institutions or individuals. This is in addition to the damage caused by criminal acts against people, property and honour. The harm caused by drugs is worse than that caused by intoxicants, because drugs destroy moral values. End quote from al-Fiqh al-Islami wa Adillatuha by Dr. Wahbah al-Suhayli, 7/5511. 
To conclude, no wise person would doubt that drugs are haram, because of the textual evidence that points to their prohibition, and because of the extensive harm that they cause. 
Punishment for taking drugs
With regard to the punishment for one who takes drugs, it is the same as the hadd punishment for drinking alcohol, as stated above by Shaykh al-Islam ibn Taymiyah with regard to hashish. Drugs come under the heading of khamr and intoxicants that have been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger. 
The scholars and da’iyahs have to explain to the people that these drugs are haram and point out the great harm that is caused by them.

66242,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66242,He works as a diver – how can he fast when water may enter his throat?,"I work as a diver in the sea every day, and sometimes drops of seawater enter my mouth and reach my throat, but they do not enter the stomach. Does this invalidate my fast? If I am not able to fast because of my work, what should I do?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
In the 
    answer to question no. 39232, we have stated that there is nothing wrong with a fasting person 
    diving into water, but he must take care to avoid letting water reach his 
    stomach as much as he can. 
Secondly: 
The Ramadaan 
    fast is one of the pillars of Islam and it is not permissible for a Muslim 
    to neglect his fast or be heedless about it because of difficulty 
    encountered as a result of his work. What he must do is strive to combine 
    fasting and work if possible. If that is not possible and he needs to work, 
    then he must give priority to fasting, and take a break from work if he can. 
    If that is not possible and he needs to work, then he should form the 
    intention to fast from the night before and start fasting in the morning, 
    then when it becomes too difficult for him, it is permissible for him to 
    break his fast because of necessity, but he has to make up that day. If it 
    does not become too difficult and he is able to complete the fast, then he 
    must do so. 
See the 
    answer to question no.  43772. 
See also 
    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 10/234. 
Thirdly: 
If a fasting 
    person swims in water and water reaches his throat without him intending it 
    to, then this does not break the fast, because he did not do it 
    deliberately. This is the view of Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on 
    him). 
See: 
    al-Mughni, 3/358; al-Insaaf, 7/434; al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 
    6/393 
Fourthly: 
The 
    questioner says that water reaches his throat but it does not enter his 
    stomach.
 The 
    scholars differed concerning the things that invalidate the fast – is what 
    counts whether the food or drink reaches the throat or the stomach? 
Shaykh Ibn 
    ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Sharh 
    al-Mumti’ (6/393): The author (may Allaah have mercy on him) mentioned 
    six issues in which the ruling depends on whether water reaches the throat 
    of the fasting person. So the ruling is based on whether water reaches the 
    throat, not the stomach. The apparent meaning of the words of Shaykh 
    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah is that the ruling is based on whether the thing that 
    breaks the fast reaches the stomach. There is no doubt that this is what is 
    meant, as there is no report in the Qur’aan or Sunnah which suggests that 
    the ruling is based on whether it reaches the throat, but the fuqaha’ (may 
    Allaah have mercy on them) said that if it reaches the throat it may be 
    assumed that it has reached the stomach, or that the ruling is based on 
    whether the thing that breaks the fast reaches any inner part of the body 
    and the throat is an inner part. End quote. 
Conclusion: 
There is 
    nothing wrong with swimming or diving deep into water when fasting. If any 
    water reaches the throat or the stomach without you intending it to, then 
    this does not break the fast.

He asked me for my details and I gave him all that over the phone, but during the conversation he was joking with me a great deal, and again he told me to call him because contacting one another by phone was better, as he said. Should I do that or not? Please note that I have become affected by his words and I started to think of him a great deal. He said words that affect me somewhat, such as, “I love you for the sake of Allaah” or “I feel comfortable with you”. Is it permissible for a man to say to a non-mahram woman, “I love you for the sake of Allaah” or not? Finally, I hope that you can advise me as to how I can solve this problem?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    A man has no right to say to a non-mahram woman, “I love you 
    for the sake of Allaah” or “I feel comfortable with you”, or to joke with 
    her, because of the fitnah involved in that, especially if she is young. 
    Such words or jokes usually lead to fitnah of the heart and becoming 
    attached to the one who says such things. This is what has happened in your 
    case, and Allaah is the One Whose help we seek. 

    Some men may do this out of heedlessness and with good 
    intentions, and they may be righteous and good, because they are used to 
    speaking in this manner. We do not think badly of the one who has said this, 
    but his speaking in this manner to a young woman like you is a mistake and 
    is undoubtedly haraam. It is sufficient for you to remember that the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Sin is that which 
    wavers in your heart and which you dislike people finding out about.” 
    Narrated by Muslim, 2553. We do not think that this man or anyone else would 
    like people to know that he said to a young woman like you, “I love you for 
    the sake of Allaah” or “I feel comfortable with you”. 

    With regard to his efforts to find you a righteous husband, 
    there is nothing wrong with his doing that, rather this is something good 
    for which he will be rewarded by Allaah. But he does not have the right to 
    get to know your details, i.e., details that have to do with your 
    appearance. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “No woman should mix with a woman and describe her to her husband so 
    that it is as if he can see her.” Narrated by Muslim, 5240.  So how about if 
    the woman is describing herself? 

    Rather it is permissible for the one who is proposing 
    marriage to look at the one to whom he wishes to propose marriage, because 
    of the interests that may be served by that, subject to the condition that 
    he is seriously interested in marrying the woman if he finds her pleasing. 

    The one who wants to propose marriage may learn about the 
    characteristics of the one to whom he wants to propose, based on what has 
    been stated by the scholars, that it is permissible to look at the woman to 
    whom one wants to propose marriage without her knowledge, so as to avoid the 
    embarrassment that may result from going to her wali (guardian) then not 
    going ahead with the proposal after seeing her. 

    No man – whether he is righteous or otherwise – has the right 
    to find out these characteristics. The man mentioned should have asked his 
    family to act as go-betweens or asked other righteous women to take care of 
    this matter. 

    What you have to do now is to cut off all ties with this man 
    completely, whether by phone or by mail. And you have to ask Allaah for 
    forgiveness and repent to Him from your negligence in this matter and 
    telling this non-mahram about your characteristics. 

    The fact that you are upset by this matter and are worried 
    about its effect on yourself and your worship is a sign that your heart is 
    (spiritually) alive, praise be to Allaah. 

    Daa’iyahs, those who give advice and teachers should beware 
    of the traps and tricks of the Shaytaan, and they should remember the words 
    of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “I am not 
    leaving behind me any fitnah that is more harmful to men than women.” 
    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5096; Muslim, 2740. 

    And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “This world is fresh and sweet, and Allaah has appointed you over it, so see 
    how you will do. Fear this world and fear women, for the first fitnah faced 
    by the Children of Israel had to do with women.” Narrated by Muslim, 2742. 

    May Allaah help us and you to remain chaste and righteous.

66273,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66273,"He sent a hadeeth in order to spread good, then he found out that it is a fabricated hadeeth. What should he do?","I got a message in my e-mail which contained a hadeeth narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). At the end of the letter, as is usual, it asked the recipient to send it to everyone he knows so as to spread the benefit of it. I sent it to many people, then I found out that the hadeeth is mawdoo’ (fabricated). Some good people told me that I should send a letter to everyone to whom I sent it, telling them that the hadeeth is fabricated. The problem is that I do not know who I sent this letter to. Is there any sin on me or do I have to pray for forgiveness? Please note that the hadeeth does not contain any legislation, rather it is a story that is supposed to have happened when the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was circumambulating the Ka’bah and there was a Bedouin circumambulating with him, etc.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Spreading da’wah messages and letters which contain 
    explanations of shar’i rulings, or preaching and beneficial stories, is an 
    important means of doing good, because many people receive them, and it is 
    easy to send them. But we should make sure that the content is sound and 
    that the ahaadeeth contained in it are saheeh (sound), because some people 
    are abusing this great blessing (of easy communication) and are spreading 
    fabricated ahaadeeth and false stories. 

    It is not permissible for anyone to say, “The Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said…” when he knows 
    that the hadeeth is mawdoo’ (fabricated) or false. The Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever tells lies about me 
    deliberately, let him take his place in Hell.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 
    1291; Muslim, 933. 

    And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Whoever narrated a hadeeth from me which he thinks is false, then he is one 
    of the liars.” Narrated by Muslim in the Introduction to his Saheeh. 

    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Sharh 
    Muslim (1/71): 

    It is haraam to narrate a fabricated hadeeth for one who 
    knows that it is fabricated or who thinks it most likely that it is 
    fabricated. Whoever narrates a hadeeth which he knows or thinks it most 
    likely to be fabricated, and does not explain that it is fabricated, is 
    included in this warning and is included among those who tell lies about the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). This 
    is also indicated by the hadeeth quoted above: “Whoever narrated a hadeeth 
    from me which he thinks is false, then he is one of the liars.” Hence the 
    scholars said that the one who wants to narrate or quote a hadeeth must 
    check it. If it is saheeh or hasan, then he may say, “The Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said such and such, 
    or did such and such, etc”, expressing certainty. If it is da’eef (weak), 
    then he should not say, “he said” or “he did” or “he commanded” or “he 
    forbade” and other such definitive words, rather he should say, “Such and 
    such was narrated from him” etc, or “it was narrated” or “it was said” or 
    “we heard that” and so on. And Allaah, may He be glorified, knows best. End 
    quote. 

    He also said: 

    With regard to the prohibition on telling lies about the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), no distinction is 
    made between reports which contain rulings and those which do not contain 
    rulings, such as preaching and exhortation, etc. In all cases it is haraam 
    and is a major sin and abhorrent action, according to the consensus of the 
    Muslims whose consensus counts, unlike the innovators who falsely claim that 
    it is permissible for fabricate ahaadeeth of exhortation, and who are 
    followed in that by many of the ignorant who claim to be ascetics. End 
    quote. 

    With regard to what you have done by spreading this 
    fabricated hadeeth, the expiation for that is to ask Allaah for forgiveness 
    and to strive to inform everyone to whom you think you most likely sent this 
    hadeeth that the hadeeth is fabricated. And Allaah burdens not a person 
    beyond his scope [al-Baqarah 2:286]. 

    You should not spread any hadeeth after this until you make 
    sure that they are soundly attributed to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him).

66279,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66279,Ruling on reserving a spot in the first row and staying away from it for a long time,"Is it permissible to observe i’tikaaf in the Prophet’s Mosque in the first row and to reserve the spot when going to sleep in the back of the mosque, then come back to the spot in the first row? Is it permissible to sleep in the first row when it is not the time for prayer?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for one who is in the mosque to put his prayer mat etc in his spot, and to sleep at the back of the mosque, and then come back to his spot, even if that is in the first row, so long as the iqamah for prayer has not been given. If the iqamah for prayer has been given and he is not there, then he has no right to the spot and his prayer mat should be taken away. 
Similarly, if he goes out of the mosque for some reason, such as going to do wudoo’ and then comes back, he has more right to the spot. But if the reason is no longer present, and he is careless and comes back late, then he has no right to it. 
The evidence regarding this matter is the report narrated by Muslim (3179) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever gets up from his place then comes back to it, has more right to it.” 
Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni (2/101): 
If he sits in a place, then he leaves it because he wants to do something or he needs to do wudoo’, he may leave… If he gets up and leaves his spot then comes back, he has more right to it, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever gets up from his place then comes back to it, has more right to it.” End quote. 
It says in Mataalib Ooli al-Nuha fi Sharh Ghaayat al-Muntaha (1/786): 
The one who comes back shortly after leaving for a reason such as wudoo’ has more right to the place where he was before than anyone else. If someone else has sat there, he has the right to make him get up… In al-Wajeez this was limited to cases where he comes back straightaway and is not distracted by anything else. End quote. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (5/135) when discussing the prohibition on reserving a spot in the mosque then leaving the mosque: 
The correct view concerning this matter is that it is not permissible to reserve a spot and leave the mosque, and his prayer mat may be removed, because the basic principle is that whatever he put down with no right may be removed. But if negative consequences are feared as a result of picking it up, such as enmity or hatred and so on, then it should not be picked up, because warding off negative consequences takes precedence over bringing benefits. If Allah knows from your intention that were it not for this prayer mat you would be in his place, then Allah will give you the reward of those who sit in the front rows, because you only left this place in the front row for a reason. 
The phrase “so long as the time for prayer has not yet come” means that if the time for prayer has come and the iqamah has been given, then we may pick up the prayer mat, because in this case it has no sanctity or protection, and because if we leave it, there will be a gap in the row, and that is contrary to the Sunnah. 
An exception is made to the correct view that it is haraam to put down the prayer mat. If a man is in the mosque and he puts his prayer mat down in the first row, or anything else to indicate that he is reserving this spot, then he goes to the back of the mosque to sleep, or to read Qur’aan or another book, then in this case he is entitled to do that, because he is still in the mosque. But if the rows started to fill, then he has to go back to his spot, so that he will not be stepping over people’s necks. 
Another exception is that mentioned by the author:
Whoever gets up from his spot for some reason, then he comes back to it soon afterwards, he has more right to it. If a person has reserved a spot and he goes out of the mosque for a valid reason, then he comes back, he has more right to it. A valid reason is something like needing to do wudoo’, or if anything happens to him that makes him go out. If he goes out, when he comes back he has more right to it. 
But the author stipulated that he should come back quickly. The apparent meaning of the author’s words is that if he takes a long time to come back, he does not have more right to it, and anyone else may sit there. 
Some of the scholars said that he does have the right to it, even if he comes back after a long time, so long as the excuse was still in effect. This view is more correct, because the continuation of the excuse is like the beginning of it. If it is permissible for him to leave the mosque and to leave the prayer mat there when the excuse first appears, then if the excuse continues it is still permissible. But it is well known that if the iqamah for prayer is given and he is still absent, then his prayer mat should be picked up. 
It says in al-Rawd: The majority did not limit it to coming back soon, i.e., the majority of the companions of Imam Ahmad did not limit it to coming back soon, as is the apparent meaning of the hadeeth. 
But what we have mentioned is the middle view, i.e., that if he comes back after a long time because the excuse continued, then he has more right to it, but if the excuse ceased, but he was careless and took a long time, then he no longer has more right to it.""(Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 5/135)
There is nothing wrong with a person who is observing i’tikaaf sleeping in the first row in between the prayers, so long as that does not cause any annoyance or hardship to anyone else, in which case it is better to keep away from the front rows. 
It is preferable to avoid sleeping in the front rows out of consideration for other people, because they do not like this action.

66293,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66293,They are living in the west and do not know about any poor people –can they send their zakat al-fitr to another country?,"We are Saudis living in Europe and we do not know about any poor people here. We have found a person who is trustworthy – in sha Allah – who said, “Give me the money and I will buy rice with some of it and give it to the poor and I will give some of it to them in cash. His argument is that there are more then 500 of us and it will be too difficult for him to buy such a large amount as it will be too difficult to carry it, and because the poor may not want anything but money because they can make more use of it than they can of rice. Should we give him the money or should we delegate our brothers in Saudi to give it on our behalf?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The majority of scholars (including Maalik, al-Shaafa’i and Ahmad) are of the view that it is not permissible to give zakat al-fitr in the form of cash, rather it must be given in the form of food, as was enjoined by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).  Al-Bukhaari (1504) and Muslim (984) narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined zakat al-fitr, one saa’ of dates or a saa’ of barley, for everyone, free or slave, male or female, of the Muslims. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Many of the poor nowadays say that they prefer to receive zakat al-fitr in the form of cash instead of food, because it is more useful to them. Is it permissible to give zakat al-fitr in the form of cash? 
He replied: 
What we think is that it is not permissible to give zakat al-fitr in the form of cash under any circumstances, rather it must be given in the form of food. If the poor man wants to sell the food and make use of its price, he may do so, but the one who is giving this zakah has to give it in the form of food. It does not matter if it is the kinds of food that were known at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or is a kind of food that is known nowadays. Rice nowadays may be more beneficial than wheat, because with rice one does not need to go to the effort of grinding it and making dough, and so on. The purpose is to benefit the poor. It was narrated in Saheeh al-Bukhaari that Abu Sa’eed (may Allah be pleased with him) said: At the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) we used to give (as zakat al-fitr) a saa’ of foodstuff, and our food at that time was dates, barley, raisins and dried yogurt. So if a person gives it in the form of food, he should choose a food that will most beneficial to the poor; this will vary from one time and place to another. 
With regard to giving it in the form of cash, clothing, furnishings or tools, this is not sufficient and does not discharge the obligation, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does an action that is not part of this matter of ours will have it rejected.”  
End quote. Majmoo’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 18/question no. 191. 
Based on this, if this person is trustworthy then you can stipulate that he has to give it all in the form of food. If he does not accept that, then you should give whatever you can to the poor of the land in which you are staying. Then there is nothing wrong with sending the rest of the zakah to another country. It is not essential for it to be sent to your country of origin, rather if you send it to wherever the need and poverty is greatest, or to relatives, that will be better. 
In the answer to question no. 43146 we stated that there is nothing wrong with sending zakah to another country when there is a need, such as sending it to a land where there are relatives of the donor, or to a land where the need is greater. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked: Can a person living in the west give zakat al-fitr on behalf of his family, knowing that they have given it on behalf of themselves? 
He replied: zakat al-fitr – which is a saa’ of food such as rice, wheat, dates or other foodstuffs, is something which each person should give on behalf of himself, as is the case with other obligatory duties, because Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined sadaqat al-fitr upon the Muslims, free and slave, male and female, young and old, and he enjoined that it be given before the people go out to the prayer. 
If the members of a household have given it on behalf of themselves, there is no need for a man who is away from his family to give it on their behalf. Rather he should give it on behalf of himself only, in the place where he is staying, if there are Muslims there who are entitled to this charity. If there is no one there who is entitled to it, then he should delegate his family to give it on his behalf in his homeland. And Allah is the Source of strength.

He replied: 
There is nothing wrong with sending zakat al-fitr to another country on the grounds that there are no poor people in one's own country. But if that is done even though there are poor people who need it in one's own country, then it is not permissible. 
End quote. Majmoo’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 18/question no. 102 
There follows a fatwa from the scholars of the Standing Committee which deals wwith these matters and more: 
The amount of zakat al-fitr is one saa’ of dates, barley, raisins, dried yogurt or other foodstuff, and it should be given on the night before Eid, until before the Eid prayer. It is also permissible to give it two or three days in advance. It should be given to the poor Muslims in the land where it is given, but it is permissible to send it to the poor in another land if the need is greater. It is permissible for the imam of the mosque and other trustworthy people to collect it and distribute it to the poor, so long as they make sure it reaches them before the Eid prayer. It is not connected to inflation, rather the amount is set in sharee’ah as one saa’. Whoever does not have anything but food for the day of Eid for himself and for those on whom he is obliged to spend, does not have to give zakat al-fitr. It is not permissible to use it for building mosques or other charitable projects. 
Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 9/369, 370.
