43609,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43609,What Is the Wisdom of Zakah?,Is there any particular reason why zakah is prescribed?,,Wisdom of Zakah,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
It should be noted that Allah does not prescribe anything that is not for the best reasons and does not achieve the best interests. Allah is the All-Knowing, Who encompasses all things by His knowledge, and He is the All-Wise Who does not prescribe anything except for a reason. 
Secondly: 
Wisdom of Zakah
With regard to the reason behind the prescription of zakah , the scholars have mentioned many reasons for it, including the following: 
1 – To complete and perfect a person’s Islam, because it is one of the pillars of Islam. If a person fulfils it, his Islam is complete. Undoubtedly this is an important aim for every Muslim, and every believing Muslim will strive to perfect his faith. 
2 – It is indicative of a person’s sincerity of faith, because wealth is dear to people, and something that is loved will not be given up except for something that is equally or more loved, or rather for something that is more loved. Hence it is called sadaqah, because it is indicative of the sincerity (sidq) of a person’s desire to please Allah, may He be exalted. 
3 – It cleanses the character of the one who gives it, so that he is saved from being a miser and is included among the generous, because if he accustoms himself to giving, whether it is giving knowledge or giving wealth or using his position to help others, that giving will become a characteristic for him and will be part of his nature, until he gets upset if there is a day when he does not give. Like the hunter who gets used to hunting, if one day he does not hunt, you will find him feeling anxious. Similarly the one who has gotten used to being generous will feel anxious if he does not give some of his wealth or use his position to help others one day. 
4 – It gladdens the heart. If a person gives something, especially wealth, he feels a sense of joy. This is something that is tried and tested, but it is subject to the condition that he gives gladly and willingly, not grudgingly. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said in Zaad al-Ma’aad that giving and generosity are means of gladdening the heart, but no one benefits from that except the one who gives gladly and willingly, and gives the wealth from his heart before he gives it from his hand. As for the one who gives from his hand but his heart is still attached to the wealth, his heart, he will never benefit from that giving. 
5 – It joins a person to the ranks of the true believers. “None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.” Just as you love to be given money with which you can meet your needs, you should also love to give it to your brother, thereby you will perfect your faith. 
6 – It is one of the means of entering Paradise, because Paradise is for the one who “speaks good words, spreads (the greeting of) salaam, feeds the hungry and prays at night when the people are asleep.” And all of us are striving to enter Paradise. 
7 – It makes the Muslim society like a single family, in which those who have the means show compassion to those who do not have the means, and the rich to those who are in hardship. Thus a person feels that he has brothers to whom he must do good as Allah has been good to him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and do good as Allah has been good to you” [al-Qasas 28:77]
So the Muslim ummah becomes like a single family. This is what is known nowadays as “social security”, but zakah is better than that, because a person is paying it as an obligatory duty and benefitting his brothers thereby. 
8 – It extinguishes the flames of revolution among the poor, for a poor man may be provoked by finding a man who can ride whatever kind of vehicle he wants, and live in whatever kind of palace he wants, and eat whatever kind of food he wants, whereas he has no means of transportation but his own two feet, and can sleep only on the ground, and so on, so undoubtedly he will feel some kind of resentment in his heart. 
But if the rich are generous to the poor , they will prevent rebellion and soothe their anger and they will say: we have brothers who acknowledge us at times of hardship, so they will feel love towards the rich.
 9 – It prevents financial crimes such as robbery and stealing and the like, because the poor will get enough to meet their needs, and they will excuse the rich because they are giving them some of their wealth, and they will see that they are treating them well, so they will not transgress against them. 
10 – Salvation from the heat of the Day of Resurrection. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every man will be in the shade of his charity on the Day of Resurrection.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ (4510). And he listed among those whom Allah will shade with His shade on the Day when there will be no shade but His: “… a man who gives charity and conceals it so much that his left hand does not know what his right hand is doing.” Agreed upon. 
11 – It leads a man to learn about the laws of Allah, because he can never pay his zakah until he has learned the rulings on zakah, the kinds of wealth that are subject to zakah and those who are entitled to receive it, and other information that he needs. 
12 – It purifies wealth, so that the wealth will grow literally and metaphorically. If a person gives charity from his wealth, that this will protect him from problems, and Allah may increase his provision because of his giving charity. Hence it says in the hadeeth: “Wealth never decreases because of charity.” Narrated by Muslim, 2588. This is something that is tried and tested, because a miser’s wealth may be overtaken by something that destroys it or most of it, such as fire, and great losses, or sickness that forces him to seek treatment which takes up much of his wealth. 
13 – It is a means of bringing down blessings. In the hadeeth it says: “No people ever withhold the zakah of their wealth but rain is withheld from the sky.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 5204. 
14 – “Charity given in secret extinguishes the wrath of the Lord,” as was narrated from the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 3759. 
15 – It wards off a bad death.
16 – It wrestles with the calamity that comes down from heaven and prevents it reaching earth. 
17 – It expiates for sins. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Charity extinguishes sins as water extinguishes fire.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 5136.

43635,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43635,Is it permissible for a wife to give up her share of inheritance without her husband’s permission?,"My husband was away for four months and during his absence I went to the court and gave up my right to my share of my father’s estate willingly. My husband objected to that because before my father died he bought a piece of land from him, but the transfer of title was not done officially, and he is afraid that my brothers will deny him his rights. Am I wrong?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    A woman has the right to dispose of her wealth however she 
    wants, if she is mature and knows what she is doing. This is the view of the 
    majority of scholars. 

    Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:  
The apparent meaning of 
    what al-Khuraqi said is that a woman who is mature and knows what she is 
    doing has the right to dispose of all her wealth, by giving it in charity or 
    by buying and selling. This is one of the two views that were narrated from 
    Ahmad, and this is also the view of Abu Haneefah, al-Shafi’i and Ibn 
    al-Mundhir. There is another view narrated from Ahmad, which is that she 
    does not have the right to dispose of more than one-third of her wealth for 
    nothing in return, except with her husband’s permission. This is also the 
    view of Malik.  

    From al-Mughni, 4/299.

    But in the interests of a good relationship with her husband, 
    the wife should tell him about that, especially in this case where there is 
    the possibility that he may lose out on his rights to your brothers. 

    So long as you have in fact given up your right to your 
    inheritance, you should try now to please your husband and remind your 
    brothers of his rights to their father’s land, and that they have no right 
    to deny him because giving others their rights is such an important matter 
    and consuming the wealth of others unlawfully is such a grievous sin.

43640,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43640,The times when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made du’aa’ during Hajj and ‘Umrah,What are the times when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made du’aa’ during his Hajj and ‘Umrah?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.It should be noted that the pilgrims who are performing Hajj and ‘Umrah are guests of Allaah, a delegation who have come to Him. Allaah has not invited them except to be generous to them and honour them. 
According to a saheeh hadeeth: “The warrior who fights for the sake of Allaah, and the pilgrim performing Hajj or ‘Umrah are guests of Allaah Who invited them and they responded to Him; they asked of Him and He gave that to them.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah; see al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 1920. 
The greatest gift that He has given to them – and all His gifts are great – is that they will go back (free of sin) as on the day their mothers bore them, after having come weighed down with a heavy burden of sin. They will not end their pilgrimage and rituals except they will come out freed from that burden of sin, coming back by the mercy of Allaah and His pleasure, after having being guests of the Most Generous, Most Merciful. 
According to a saheeh hadeeth: “Whoever comes on pilgrimage to this House and does not utter any obscenity or do any evil action, will go back free of sin as on the day his mother bore him.” 
Glory be to Him, how great and majestic He is! All these records which were filled with sins will be cancelled out, because of the steps that the Muslim took to reach the House of Allaah. What a journey it is, and whoever misses it cannot claim that he has gained anything, and whoever does it cannot lose anything. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “An accepted Hajj brings no less a reward than Paradise.” 
With regard to the times when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made du’aa’ during Hajj and ‘Umrah, they are as follows: 
1 – Du’aa’ at al-Safa. It is narrated in the lengthy hadeeth narrated by Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) describing the Hajj of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that he started with al-Safa and climbed until he could see the Ka’bah, then he turned to face the qiblah and proclaimed the Oneness of Allaah and magnified Him, and said: “Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadeer; laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu, anjaza wa’dah wa nasara ‘abdah wa hazama al-ahzaaba wahdah (There is no god but Allaah alone with no partner or associate, His is the dominion and to Him be praise and He has power over all things; there is no god but Allaah alone, He fulfilled His promise, granted victory to His slave and defeated the confederates alone).” He said this three times. Narrated by Muslim, 1218. 
2 – Du’aa’ at al-Marwah. In the hadeeth referred to above, it says: Then he came down to al-Marwah, until when his feet reached the bottom of the valley he ran, until he came to al-Marwah, and he did at al-Marwah as he had done at al-Safa. Narrated by Muslim, 1218. 
3 – Du’aa’ at al-Mash’ar al-Haraam, as narrated in the hadeeth quoted above: “Then he rode al-Qaswa’ (his camel) until he came to al-Mash’ar al-Haraam, where he turned to face the qiblah and said du’aa’ and magnified [Allaah] and proclaimed His Oneness, and he remained standing there until it had become very light.” Narrated by Muslim, 1218. 
4 – Du’aa’ on the day of ‘Arafah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The best of du’aa’ is on the day of ‘Arafah.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3585; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 4274. 
5 – Du’aa’ after stoning the smallest and middle Jamarahs. Al-Bukhaari narrated in his Saheeh from Saalim ibn ‘Abd-Allaah that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both) used to stone the closest Jamarah (al-Jamarah al-Dunya) with seven pebbles, saying takbeer after each throw, then he would proceed until he reached the level ground, then he would stand facing the qiblah for a long time, making du’aa’ and raising his hands. Then he would stone the middle Jamarah likewise, then he would move to the left towards the level ground, and stand facing the qiblah for a long time, making du’aa’ and raising his hands. Then he would stone Jamarat al-‘Aqabah in the bottom of the valley, and he would not stand by it, and he would say: ‘This is what I saw the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) doing.’ Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1752
