8795,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8795,Ruling on using alcohol to dissolve kidney stones,"I suffered from pain in my kidneys on a number of occasions, and I could hardly urinate. I went to the doctor, who told me: your treatment is to drink alcohol, because alcohol has the effect of dissolving kidney stones. Then I drank alcohol and benefitted from it a lot. Will Allah hold me to account for drinking alcohol? Please give me the correct answer; may Allah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for you to drink alcohol. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has answered this question. In Saheeh Muslim it is narrated that Taariq ibn Suwayd said: I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “What about the alcohol that we make for medicinal purposes?” He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No, in fact it is a disease.” He stated that it is a disease and that there is no cure in it. This hadith indicates that it is a disease, and in modern medicine, there is general consensus that alcohol is harmful in all cases. Many ( researchers ) have written books and articles on this topic, stating that the tissues of a forty-year old drinker’s body are like those of a sixty-year-old. Even though you may have benefitted as far as your kidneys are concerned, and you have noted that it had an effect, some other part of your body will inevitably have been harmed; alcohol causes harm in all cases. It is not permissible for you to drink it. There are permissible medicines which you can use to treat your kidneys, without using this thing. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O slaves of Allah, seek medical treatment but do not seek it is anything haraam. For Allah does not make the cure for this ummah in things that He has forbidden for it.” Even though you may have noticed a benefit in one way, it will inevitably cause a lot of harm in many other ways, as stated in the hadith of Taariq ibn Suwayd referred to above, which was narrated by Muslim.
And Allah knows best.","From Fataawa Samaahat al-Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Humayd, p. 153"
8796,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8796,Should      he delay Hajj to please his mother?,"Some days ago i read Qur'an and in Sura 'Imran i found the words of Allah that men owe Hajj to Allah. This is my last semester of studying in U.S. and i have some money (around $2000,00). However i am afraid that if i spend this money for hajj and my mother will know it, she will get upset. She does not like that i am practicing islam. On the one hand, i do not know if i have another chance to go for hajj in the future. The money for my studying are coming through the Kazakhstani government and this is my last semester in U.S. In other words, after i finish, insha Allah!, i will have to go back to Kazakhstan to work for government for 5 years and i do not know whether i will be rich enough in Kazakhstan to make hajj. What do you think i should do? On the other hand, if Allah wills and i save this money i would go home and probably buy a car so that my mother at last will get richer. She brought me up by herself since i was 3 years old: my father died when i was 3 years old. And i know how difficult it was for her to bring me up by herself without husband and even good enough relatives. May Allah reward you for your work and let you and your family enter the paradise.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Hajj is one of the obligatory duties of Islam, one of the pillars of Islam. It is not permissible for the person who is able to do it to delay it or to hesitate to do it. And there is no obedience to any created being if it entails disobedience to Allah.
 Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence)” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:97]
 The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Islam is built on five (pillars): testimony that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, establishing regular prayer (salaah), paying the zakaah, fasting in Ramadaan, and pilgrimage to the House.”
 So it is not permissible foryou to please your mother by disobeying Allah. You should honour her and treat her with kindness, but not by disobeying Allah. Whoever pleases people by angering Allah, Allah will be angry with him and will make people angry with him.",Shaykh ‘Abd al-Kareem al-Khudayr
8798,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8798,Is      it permissible to accept an invitation to a meal from a non-Muslim in      order to get close to him?,"Calling people to Islam means establishing personal relationships with the Kuffaar, in the first place to break the ice and pave the way for da’wah. If one of them invites me to eat or drink something that contains nothing haraam, such as cheese, fish and tea, is it permissible for me to eat or drink it? What if there is the possibility that the vessels have been used before that to serve pork or wine – even though they have been washed with soap and water?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Relationships between people are of different kinds. If the Muslim has a relationship of friendship, love and brotherhood with a kaafir, this is haraam and may be kufr. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“You (O Muhammad) will not find any people who believe in Allaah and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allaah and His Messenger (Muhammad), even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred (people). For such He has written Faith in their hearts, and strengthened them with Rooh (proofs, light and true guidance) from Himself. And He will admit them to Gardens (Paradise) under which rivers flow, to dwell therein (forever). Allaah is pleased with them, and they with Him. They are the party of Allaah. Verily, it is the party of Allaah that will be the successful” [al-Mujaadilah 58:22]
And there are other aayaat and ahaadeeth which convey the same meaning.
If it is a relationship based on selling or buying, or accepting an invitation to eat halaal food, or accepting a gift of something that is permissible, for example, without that having an influence on the Muslim, then this is permitted and it is permissible to eat the food offered by a kaafir to a Muslim if the food and drink are halaal. Even if it is presented in a vessel which has previously been used for drinking wine or eating pork, etc., it is still permissible to take it, solong as the vessel has been washed after being used for haraam or naajis (impure) things and all traces of them have been completely removed. If this will help to convey the message of Islam, this is a stronger reason why these invitations should be accepted and these relationships upheld, and there is more hope that there will be a reward in this case.","From Fataawaa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 12/254"
