          The historians and some of the mufassireen 
          have stated that her name was Rahmah bint Meesha ibn Yoosuf ibn Ya’qoob. 
 
          But this is something which is not proven 
          in any clear sound text, rather it was transmitted from the books of 
          the People of the Book, or by some Muslims from them. We shall list 
          those who were of this view and transmitted it: 
 
          1 – Al-Suyooti said: Ibn ‘Asaakir narrated that Wahb 
          ibn Munabbih (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The wife of Ayyoob 
          (peace be upon him) was Rahmah (may Allaah be pleased with her) bint 
          Meeshaa ibn Yoosuf ibn Ya’qoob ibn Ishaaq ibn Ibraaheem (peace be upon 
          them).

          in Tafseer al-Baydaawi, 3/310; Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 
          9/265; Tafseer al-Baghawi, 2/451) 
 
          2 – Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may 
          Allaah have mercy on him) said:
 
          But these Israa’eeli (i.e., Jewish) reports 
          to be mentioned for the purpose of proving a point, they are not to 
          be believed. They are of three types:
 
          (i)Those which we know are 
          sound because of evidence which we have which proves them to be true. 
          These are saheeh.
 
          (ii)Those which we know are 
          false because of evidence which we have which contradicts them.
 
          (iii)Those which we do not know 
          whether they are true or false. So we do not believe in them and we 
          do not disbelieve in them, but it is permissible to narrate them for 
          the reasons given above. 
 
          Most of them are things which serve no 
          religious purpose, hence the scholars of the People of the Book differ 
          greatly concerning such things. The mufassireen also differed concerning 
          them as a result of that, as they mentioned, for example, the names 
          of the People of the Cave, the colour of their dog and their number, 
          or what kind of tree the staff of Moosa came from, and other matters 
          which Allaah did not mention in detail in the Qur’aan because knowing 
          the specific details does not serve any worldly or religious purpose. 
 
          (Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 13/366-367). 
 
          Al-Shanqeeti (may Allaah have mercy on 
          him) said: 
 
           What the mufassireen have said 
          concerning the name of their dog – some said that its name was Qitmeer, 
          and some said that its name was Hamdaan, etc. – we need not dwell on 
          at length, because it serves no purpose. There are many things in the 
          Qur’aan which neither Allaah nor His Messenger has explained to us in 
          detail, and there are no proven reports concerning them; there is no 
          benefit to be gained by researching such matters.

21109,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21109,He got married then he regretted it,"I am a young man and have been married for five months, but I am not able to get along with my wife because she is extremely short whereas I was looking for a girl whose height was suited to mine. When my family described her to me before marriage, they told me that she was tall, and when I looked at her in the manner prescribed in sharee’ah, before marriage, she was dressed up, her hair was styled, and she was wearing high heels. I noticed that during our engagement but I thought that my feelings towards her would improve after marriage. When I married her and saw what she really looks like and how short she is, and I came to know her way of thinking, which is completely different from my way of thinking, I hated her and could not longer bear to talk to her. She realized that and told me that she felt that I did not like her and couldn’t stand her. Sometimes when I come in she is crying, and my heart breaks because of the wrong that I have done to her. She has not harmed me in any way, on the contrary she has shown me the greatest respect and loves me deeply. But what should I do? I have tried hard to make myself like her, but with no success. I have even started to think of divorce so that she and I will both have a break. Sometimes I think of taking another wife. I hope you can help me find a solution.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    This is a problem that often happens. You are not alone in 
    your suffering. The root of the problem, in my view, is the fact that the 
    husband was not able to see his fiancée fully in the manner prescribed in 
    sharee’ah, by sitting with her – but not being alone with her, of course – 
    and looking closely at her and even asking to see her again at another time. 
     

    Yes, you made a great mistake when you felt put off by this 
    girl at the time of engagement but you went ahead with the marriage.  It 
    would have been better for you not to take a risk in such matters, because 
    the one who wants to get married should feel completely at ease with his 
    choice and not hesitant, so what about one who feels discontent as in your 
    case? 

    The real problem you face now is that this girl loves you and 
    respects you, and she is giving you all your rights and more. She has also 
    gotten pregnant from you.  If that were not the case, we would not hesitate 
    to advise you to leave her.  

    Even more unfortunate than that is the fact that her life has 
    been turned into an unbearable hell. She cannot help weeping when she thinks 
    of her situation and how her hopes of finding a husband with whom to share 
    love and happiness have been dashed. 

    Yes, this is something decreed by Allaah and a real fact that 
    we have to acknowledge and live with, namely that sometimes spouses do not 
    get along and divorce takes place, and the life of one or both of them is 
    wrecked as a result. You cannot live with all this pain except by means of 
    patience and seeking reward from Allaah, first of all, and secondly by 
    understanding the causes of failure. Hence you have your share of blame and 
    you have to bear part of the consequences of this matter, even if only a 
    little. You have to face up to the following: 

    1 – Try to live with this girl and put up with her as much as 
    possible. At least wait until the child is born, and perhaps things will 
    change and your hatred will turn to love. 

    2 – If your circumstances allow you to keep her whilst 
    looking for another wife who will make you happy and let you stay with your 
    first wife, and you can look after your children with her and spare them the 
    pain of separation and divorce, this is something that is worth thinking 
    about. 

    3 – If the solutions suggested above will not work; if the 
    matter is beyind your control and your hatred for her increases and you are 
    no longer able to live with her, then divorce is allowed in sharee’ah in 
    such cases. 

    The bitterness of divorce will be easier for her than the 
    ongoing misery of living with you, and perhaps she will find a husband with 
    whom she can be happy. And perhaps you will also find a wife with whom you 
    can be happy. 

    Divorce – even though it is disliked – is the solution when 
    husband and wife cannot live amicably together. 

    Try to think about these solutions, and think long and hard 
    about them. Do not be hasty. You should also turn to Allaah and ask Him to 
    guide you with regard to this matter, for He is close to His sincere slaves. 
    May Allaah help you and give you strength. 

    Dr Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’wi 

    We remind you of the words of Allaah (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “and live with them honourably. If you dislike them, it 
    may be that you dislike a thing and Allaah brings through it a great deal of 
    good”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:19] 

    “and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for 
    you”

    [al-Baqarah 2:216]
 And the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No believing 
    man should hate a believing woman. If he dislikes one of her characteristics 
    he will be pleased with another.” Narrated by Muslim, 1469. 
What this means is that 
    it is not right for a believing man to hate a believing woman, because if he 
    notices a bad characteristic in her and dislikes her because of it, he will 
    find another, praiseworthy characteristic in her and will love her because 
    of it, such as if she is chaste or kind or obedient… etc. 
This applies if she has some characteristics that do not please him, so how about if she is carrying out her duties towards him in the most complete manner?.",Islam Q&A
21113,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21113,Working in a riba-based bank without directly dealing with riba and depositing money in such a bank,"I work in a bank in a particular country, in a department that does not deal with riba-based transactions, but the central bank does deal with interest and it is a government foundation. What is the ruling on working in this bank? I hope you can advise me",,,"Praise be to Allah.Your working in this bank is haram, even if you are in a department which does not deal with riba-based transactions. It is sufficient to note that the “central bank” is the head bank and working in the other departments complements the work of the sections that do deal with riba; the bank is formed from all the departments and all the institutions connected to it are engaged in riba.  
The scholars have stated that it is not permissible to work even as a guard or driver for such institutions, so how about working as a teller or clerk? 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is not permissible to work in a riba-based institution even if a person is working as a driver or guard, because that means that he is working for the riba-based institution, which implies that he approves of it. For whoever disapproves of a thing would not work to support it, so if he is working for it that implies that he approves of it, and the one who approves of something that is haram is also guilty of sin. 
But if he is directly involved in recording transactions, writing, sending and depositing etc, then he is undoubtedly dealing directly with something haram. It was proven in the hadeeth of Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba, the one who pays it, the two who witness it and the one who writes it down. He said: “They are all the same.”(Fatawa Islamiyyah. 2/401 )
The Standing Committee was asked about a man who worked as a night guard for one of the banks, and he had nothing to do with the bank’s transactions – should he continue with this job or leave? 
They replied:
 It is not permissible for a Muslim to work as a guard for banks that deal with riba, because this is a kind of cooperating in sin and transgression, and Allah has forbidden that as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“but do not help one another in sin and transgression” [Al-Maa'idah 5:2]
 Most of the banks deal with riba, so you have to look for a halal means of earning a living, not this way.

21119,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21119,"Evidence that tattooing, plucking the eyebrows and filing the teeth is haraam",What is the Islamic ruling on women reducing their eyebrows? Please quote the specific ahaadeeth if possible.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Allaah has forbidden women to remove any part of the hair of their eyebrows; this action is called al-namas in Arabic, and it is haraam because of the following evidence: 
1 – Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They (all those who worship others than Allaah) invoke nothing but female deities besides Him (Allaah), and they invoke nothing but Shaytaan (Satan), a persistent rebel!
Allaah cursed him. And he [Shaytaan (Satan)] said: ‘I will take an appointed portion of your slaves.
Verily, I will mislead them, and surely, I will arouse in them false desires; and certainly, I will order them to slit the ears of cattle, and indeed I will order them to change the nature created by Allaah.’ And whoever takes Shaytaan (Satan) as a Wali (protector or helper) instead of Allaah, has surely, suffered a manifest loss”
[al-Nisa’ 4:117-119]
The relevant point in this verse is that Iblees will tell people to change the creation of Allaah. Some of the mufassireen interpreted it by saying that what is meant here in this verse is tattooing, plucking the eyebrows and filing the teeth, as we shall see below. 
Al-Qurtubi said in his commentary on this verse: 
A group said what was meant by changing the creation of Allaah was tattooing and other things that are done for the purpose of beautification. This was stated by Ibn Mas’ood and al-Hasan. 
Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 5/392 
2 – It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah said: “Allaah has cursed the women who do tattoos and those who ask for tattoos to be done, those who ask for their eyebrows to be plucked, and the women ask for their teeth to be filed for the purpose of beautification, changing the creation of Allaah.” A woman from the tribe of Bani Asad whose name was Umm Ya’qoob heard of that and she came and said, “I have heard that you have cursed So and so and So and so.” He said, “Why should I not curse those whom the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed and who are mentioned in the Book of Allaah?’ She said, “I have read what is between the two covers [of the Qur’aan], and I did not find anything in it like what you have said.” He said, “If you have read it, have you not read that Allaah says,  
‘And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it)’
[al-Hashr 59:7]?” 
She said, “Of course.” He said, “He forbade that.” She said, “I think your wife does it.” He said, “Go and look.” So she went and looked and she did not see what she was looking for. He said, “If she had been like that, she would not be with us.”  
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4604; Muslim, 2125 
Al-Qurtubi said concerning the meaning of tattooing: 
Tattooing is done on the hand; it involves piercing the back of the hand with a needle and filling it with kohl or another substance so that it changes colour. [Translator’s note: this refers to the type of tattooing known at that time] 
Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 5/392. 
Ibn Hajar said concerning the meaning of plucking the eyebrows: 
The mutanammisah is the one who asks another to pluck her eyebrows, and the naamisah is the one who does it. Al-nimaas means removing the hair of the face with tweezers. It was said that the word nimaas refers specifically to removing hair from the eyebrows in order to reduce them or make them straight. Abu Dawood said in al-Sunan: al-naamisah is the one who plucks the eyebrows in order to reduce them. 
Fath al-Baari, 10/377 
It was said concerning the meaning of those who ask for their teeth to be filed (al-mutafallijaat)
 This refers to one who asks for her teeth to be filed or who does that. Falj means making a gap between two teeth and tafalluj means making a gap between two attached things by means of filing or the like. This was usually done to the incisor and the eyetooth for the purpose of beautification. A woman might do this if her teeth were close together so that she would have gaps between her teeth, or an old woman might have do to make it look as if she were younger, because young women usually have gaps between their teeth that disappear as the woman gets older. 
Fath al-Baari, 10/372 
Al-Qurtubi said: 
With regard to all of these matters, the ahaadeeth indicate that those who do them are cursed and that they are major sins. But there is some difference of scholarly opinion concerning the reason why they are forbidden. It was said that it is because it is a kind of deception, or because it is changing the creation of Allaah, as Ibn Mas’ood said. This is more correct, and it also includes the first meaning. And it was said that what is prohibited is what is permanent, because it is changing the creation of Allaah; with regard to what is not permanent, such as kohl and make-up, the scholars have permitted that.

21127,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21127,Ruling on buying shares in a foreign company,What is the shar’i ruling on buying shares in a foreign company?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    1 – Definition of “shares” 

    A share is a specific part of the total capital of a 
    company. 

    A share is defined as being the share that the shareholder 
    has in a financial company, or the portion of the company’s capital that is 
    assigned to him as confirmed in a legal document that has a nominal value, 
    where the sum of all the shares represents the capital of the company and 
    each share is of equal value.  

    Based on this, a share is an independent document that is 
    given to the shareholder and contains information that has to do with the 
    company, such as the company name, the amount of its capital, its 
    nationality, the location of its headquarters, the serial number of the 
    share, its value and the name of the shareholder, if he is to be mentioned 
    by name, or the comment that the share belongs to the bearer. 

    2 – Ruling on shares: 

    There is nothing basically wrong with buying and selling 
    shares, but there are a number of things to be avoided, as follows: 

    (i)Buying and selling shares in 
    companies in which it is haraam to have shares, because they sell things 
    that are not halaal, or they help in spreading corruption and falsehood.

    (ii)Buying and selling shares in 
    banks that deal in riba (usury or interest).

    (iii)Depositing shares in riba-based 
    banks, because that will lead to the profits being mixed with riba.

    The Standing Committee was asked about buying shares in 
    private companies that deal only in charitable work, agriculture, banks, 
    insurance companies and petroleum companies. They replied: 

    It is permissible for a person to buy shares in these 
    companies so long as they do not deal with riba; if they deal with riba then 
    it is not permitted, because it is proven in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and by 
    scholarly consensus, that dealing in riba is haraam. 

    Similarly it is not permissible for a person to buy shares in 
    commercial insurance companies, because insurance policies involve ambiguity 
    and buying something unknown, and they involve riba, so they are forbidden 
    according to Islamic sharee’ah. 

    Fataawa Islamiyyah, 2/43 

    The following is the text of a question and answer from the 
    Fatwa Council of the Kuwaiti Finance House: 

    Question: 

    Is it permissible to buy and sell shares in foreign companies 
    such as General Motors, Phillips and Mercedes, knowing that these are 
    manufacturing companies, but they do not hesitate to lend and borrow money 
    with interest? 

    Answer: 

    The principle of buying shares in manufacturing, commercial 
    and agricultural companies is allowed according to sharee’ah, because they 
    are subject to either profit or loss, and this is akin to mudaarabah or 
    limited partnerships which the Lawgiver allows, subject to the condition 
    that this partnership avoid engaging in riba transactions, whether that 
    involves taking or paying interest. It may be understood from your question 
    that you are aware that these companies deal with riba, taking and paying 
    interest. On this basis, buying shares in them is to be regarded as buying 
    shares in a riba-based operation, which is forbidden in sharee’ah.  And

Difference between Hijab and Niqab

What is the prescribed hijab in Islam?


Should a woman cover her face?


Evidence for niqab from the Sunnah","Praise be to Allah.What is hijab?
Hijab in Arabic means covering or concealing. Hijab is the name of something that is used to cover. Everything that comes between two things is Hijab. 
Hijab means everything that is used to cover something and prevent anyone from reaching it, such as curtains, door keepers and garments, etc. 
What is khimar?
Khimar comes from the word khamr, the root meaning of which is to cover. For example, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Khammiru aniyatakum (cover your vessels).” Everything that covers something else is called Khimar. 
But in common usage Khimar has come to be used as a name for the garment with which a woman covers her head; in some cases this does not go against the linguistic meaning of Khimar. 
Some of the jurists have defined it as that which covers the head, the temples and the neck. 
Difference between khimar and hijab
The difference between the Hijab and the Khimar is that the Hijab is something which covers all of a woman’s body, whilst the Khimar in general is something with which a woman covers her head. 
What is Niqab?
Niqab is that with which a woman veils her face (tantaqib)… 
Difference between Hijab and Niqab
The difference between Hijab and Niqab is that the Hijab is that which covers all the body, whilst Niqab is that which covers a woman’s face only. 
The woman’s dress as prescribed in shari’ah (“Islamic dress”) is that which covers her head, face and all of her body. 
Is niqab compulsory? 
But the Niqab or burqa’ – which shows the eyes of the woman – has become widespread among women, and some of them do not wear it properly. Some scholars have forbidden wearing it on the grounds that it is not Islamic in origin, and because it is used improperly and people treat it as something insignificant, demonstrating negligent attitudes towards it and using new forms of Niqab which are not prescribed in Islam, widening the opening for the eyes so that the cheeks, nose and part of the forehead are also visible. 
Therefore, if the woman’s Niqab or burqa’ does not show anything but the eyes, and the opening is only as big as the left eye, as was narrated from some of the salaf, then that is permissible, otherwise she should wear something which covers her face entirely. 
What is the prescribed hijab in Islam?
Shaykh Muhammad al-Salih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The Hijab prescribed in shari’ah means that a woman should cover everything that it is haram for her to show, i.e., she should cover that which it is obligatory for her to cover, first and foremost of which is the face, because it is the focus of temptation and desire. 
A woman is obliged to cover her face in front of anyone who is not her mahram (blood relative to whom marriage is permanently forbidden). From this we learn that the face is the most essential thing to be covered. 
There is evidence from the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the views of the Sahabah and the imams and scholars of Islam, which indicates that women are obliged to cover all of their bodies in front of those who are not their mahrams.” (Fatawa al-Marah al-Muslimah, 1/ 391, 392) 
Should a woman cover her face?
Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said: 
“The correct view as indicated by the evidence is that the woman’s face is ‘awrah which must be covered. It is the most tempting part of her body, because what people look at most is the face, so the face is the greatest ‘awrah of a woman. This is in addition to the shar’i evidence which states that it is obligatory to cover the face. 
For example, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent (like both eyes for necessity to see the way, or outer palms of hands or one eye or dress like veil, gloves, headcover, apron), and to draw their veils all over Juyoubihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)…” [al-Nur 24:31] 
Drawing the veil all over the juyub implies covering the face. 
When Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) was asked about the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies.” [al-Ahzab 33:59], he covered his face, leaving only one eye showing. This indicates that what was meant by the verse was covering the face. This was the interpretation of Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) of this verse, as narrated from him by ‘Ubaydah al-Salmani when he asked him about it. 
Evidence for niqab from the Sunnah
In the Sunnah, there are many ahadith, such as: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The woman in ihram is forbidden to veil her face (wear Niqab) or to wear the burqa’.” This indicates that when women were not in ihram, women used to cover their faces. 
This does not mean that if a woman takes off her Niqab or burqa’ in the state of ihram that she should leave her face uncovered in the presence of non-mahram men. Rather she is obliged to cover it with something other than the Niqab or burqa’, on the evidence of the hadith of ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: “We were with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in ihram, and when men passed by us, we would lower the Khimar on our heads over our faces, and when they moved on we would lift it again.” 
Women in ihram and otherwise are obliged to cover their faces in front of non-mahram men, because the face is the center of beauty and it is the place that men look at… and Allah knows best.” (Fatawa al-Marah al-Muslimah, 1/396, 397) 
He also said: 
“It is OK to cover the face with the Niqab or burqa’ which has two openings for the eyes only, because this was known at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and because of necessity. If nothing but the eyes show, this is fine, especially if this is customarily worn by women in her society.” (Fatawa al-Marah al-Muslimah, 1/399)

He is one of those who has the quality of gheerah (protective jealousy), but it may have gone too far. After her sister got married, he stopped allowing her to go to her father’s house, because her sister and her husband live in the same house, saying that he [the sister’s husband] might see her, although when she goes to her father’s house she sits in a separate room where her sister’s husband cannot come if she is there. If he does let her go, it is only for a very short time, and he does not let her take her abayah off, thinking that her sister’s husband might see her, even though in fact that is not possible, because her family are conservative, in sha Allaah. So the question is: is what this husband is doing correct according to sharee’ah, and is his jealousy appropriate, or is it a kind of waswasah (insinuating whisper from the Shaytaan)? Is there is a set limit within which the husband has no right to prevent his wife from visiting her father – I mean such as a maximum limit – or not? Could the husband be asked to let his wife visit her family, say, once or twice a week? Please advise us, may Allaah reward you?",,,"Praise be to Allah.

21147,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21147,Ruling on drinking whilst standing,I have read some ahaadeeth which say that it is forbidden to drink whilst standing. Does this mean that drinking whilst standing is prohibited?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    There are ahaadeeth which say that the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade drinking whilst standing. For 
    example, Muslim (2024, 2025) narrated from Anas and Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri 
    (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) forbade drinking whilst standing. 

    But there are other ahaadeeth which say that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) drank whilst standing, such as 
    the following: 

    Al-Bukhaari (1637) and Muslim (2027) narrated that Ibn 
    Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I brought water to the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) from 
    Zamzam and he drank whilst standing. 

    Al-Bukhaari (5615) narrated from ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) that he drank whilst standing then he said: Some people say it is 
    makrooh for one of you to drink whilst standing, but I saw the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) doing what you have seen me do. 

    Ahmad (797) narrated that ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) drank whilst standing, and the people looked at him as if 
    they objected to that. He said: “What are you looking at? If I drink whilst 
    standing, I saw the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    drink whilst standing, and if I drink sitting, I saw the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) drink whilst sitting.” Ahmad Shaakir 
    said in Tahqeeq al-Musnad: its isnaad is saheeh. 

    Al-Tirmidhi (1881) narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: “We used to eat at the time of the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) whilst walking, and 
    we used to drink whilst standing.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in 
    Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 

    The scholars reconciled these hadeeth by stating that the 
    forbidding mentioned here does not mean that it is haraam, rather it is to 
    be understood as advice, and that it is better to drink whilst sitting. The 
    ahaadeeth which describe the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) drinking whilst standing indicate that it is permissible to do 
    that. 

    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    There is no contradiction in these ahaadeeth, praise be to 
    Allaah, and none of them are da’eef (weak). Rather they are all saheeh. The 
    correct view is that the forbidding mentioned in them is to be understood as 
    meaning that it is disliked. The fact that the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) drank whilst standing indicates that it is 
    permissible to do so. This is all that needs to be said on the matter. 

    If it is asked: How come it is makrooh to drink whilst 
    standing when the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    did that? 

    The answer is that if what he  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) did was to show that it is permissible, then it is not 
    makrooh, rather he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was 
    obliged to show and explain that, so how can it be makrooh?  It is proven 
    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did wudoo’ 
    washing each part only once, and that he circumambulated the Ka’bah (i.e., 
    did tawaaf) riding a camel – even though there is scholarly consensus that 
    it is better to do wudoo’ washing each part three times and that it is 
    better to do tawaaf walking. There are many similar examples. The Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was demonstrating that 
    something is permissible one time or many times, but he persisted in 
    following the better option. So usually when he did wudoo’ he washed each 
    part three times, and he usually did tawaaf walking, and he usually drank 
    whilst sitting. This is clear and is not confusing to anyone who has the 
    slightest claim to knowledge. And Allaah knows best. 

    This reconciliation between the ahaadeeth was suggested by 
    al-Khattaabi, Ibn Battaal, al-Tabari and others. 

    Al-Haafiz said in Fath al-Baari: 
This is the best and 
    soundest explanation, and the farthest removed from contradiction. 

    It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (22/133): 

    The basic ruling is that one should drink whilst sitting, 
    which is better, but one may drink whilst standing. The Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did both to demonstrate that there is a 
    lot of room for manoeuvre in this matter.",Islam Q&A

He says that there was a big argument between him and his wife’s family, so his wife’s family started making him have doubts about his wife and telling him that she had been betraying him from the first day of marriage until now (approximately fifteen years). All of this was done by hints, not stated bluntly, but these were obvious hints that were made repeatedly. They got other people to help them in that so that he would divorce her, and now he is suffering from waswaas (whispers from the Shyatan). It should be noted that they have children and that the wife prays regularly, always on time. This has led to strong rumours circulating among people and the husband is living in isolation; no one visits him, not even his brothers, because of these rumours. When he confronted his wife she denied it vehemently and did not speak to him for several days, even though when the disputes between him and her family grow intense, she behaves in a manner that causes him to have doubts about her and there are times when the husband believes these rumours and times when he thinks that they are untrue. He often thinks of divorce because she has caused him problems in his social life and at work and with his brothers. It should be noted that the husband has never seen or heard his wife speak to any stranger (non-mahram man). What is your opinion?

    It is obvious that there has been a misunderstanding between this man and his wife’s family, and that they want him to divorce her. It is essential to find out the wife’s point of view. If she wants a divorce then he has to try to change her mind by tackling the cause of the problem. Otherwise he may divorce her, and perhaps Allaah will compensate each of them with someone who is better than the other. He should however, avoid discussing the issue of her betraying him. But if his wife does not want a divorce then he should treat his wife well and seek refuge with Allaah from the accursed Shaytaan, and he should not pay any attention to the doubts for which he has no proof. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said that there is gheerah (protective jealousy) that Allaah loves and there is gheerah which Allaah hates. The gheerah that Allaah loves is gheerah which is cause for doubt, and the gheerah that Allaah hates is gheerah when there is no cause for suspicion.",Shaykh Sa’d al-Humayd

May Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah 
          have mercy on him) said: 
 
          What the Muslims should do is to have as many children as they can, 
          because this is the command issued by the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he said, “Marry the 
          one who is loving and fertile, for I will be proud of your great numbers.” 
          Because increasing the number of children increases the size of the 
          ummah, and being of great numbers is a source of pride, as Allaah said, 
          reminding the Children of Israel of that (interpretation of the meaning): 
           
 
          “And We helped you with wealth and children and made you more numerous 
          in man-power” [al-Israa’ 17:6] 
 
          And Shu’ayb said to his people: 
 
          “ ‘And remember when you were but few, and He multiplied you’”
 [al-A’raaf 
          7:86 – interpretation of the meaning]
 
          No one would deny that if the 
          ummah is great in number this will lend it pride and strength. This 
          is contrary to what is imagined by those who think evil thoughts, that 
          the large numbers of the ummah is the cause of its poverty and hunger. 
          If the ummah increases in number and relies on Allaah, and believes 
          in His promise, in the aayah  “And no moving (living) creature is 
          there on earth but its provision is due from Allaah” [Hood 11:6 – interpretation 
          of the meaning], then Allaah will make things easy for them and 
          will grant them sufficient means from His Bounty. 
 
          On this basis, the answer to the 
          question is as follows: 
 
          A woman should not use birth control 
          pills unless the following two conditions are met: 
 
          (1)She 
          should have a reason for that such as being sick and unable to bear 
          a pregnancy every year, or being physically weak, or having other reasons 
          why getting pregnant every year would be harmful for her.
 
          (2) 
          Her husband should give his permission, because the husband has the 
          right to have children. This must also be done in consultation with 
          a doctor, to find out whether taking these pills will be harmful to 
          her or not.
If 
          these two conditions are met, then it is OK for her to use these pills, 
          but that should not be on a permanent basis, i.e., she should not use 
          the type of birth control pills that prevent pregnancy permanently, 
          because this is preventing progeny. 
 
          (Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 
          2/657, 658) 
 
          Concerning the harms caused by 
          contraception, the Shaykh (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
 
          Birth control pills: I have heard 
          from a number of sources that doctors say they are harmful. Even if 
          we do not know this from the doctors, we know it from ourselves, because 
          preventing something natural that Allaah has created and decreed for 
          the daughters of Adam is undoubtedly harmful. Allaah is Wise, and He 
          has only created this blood which flows at certain times for a reason. 
          If we prevent it with these medicines, that is harmful without a doubt. 
 
          But I have heard that the matter 
          is worse than we imagine, that they may be a means of damaging the womb, 
          and a means of causing nervous disorders. This is something we must 
          beware of. 
 
          (Liqaa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh, 
          question no. 1147) 
 
          Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz 
          (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: 
 
          What is the ruling on removing 
          the uterus in order to avoid having children for medical reasons which 
          are either present, or may occur in the future and have been predicted 
          by medical and scientific means?  
 
          He answered: if that is necessary, 
          then it is OK, otherwise it should not be done, because the Lawgiver 
          urges us to have children and promotes that in order to increase the 
          size of the ummah. But if there is a necessary reason then it is OK, 
          just as it is permissible to use means of contraception for a limited 
          time for a legitimate shar’i reason. (9/434) 
 
          What is said concerning the birth 
          control pill may also be said concerning the coil. It has been definitely 
          proven by the doctors that this contraceptive method causes harm, especially 
          when it is used continually. It is known that the woman who has a coil 
          inserted has an increased flow of menstrual blood, and her period may 
          come twice a month, which causes an iron deficiency in her body. Iron 
          is one of the important minerals which the body needs. Some women may 
          become anaemic when they use the coil and it makes their periods longer, 
          resulting in the woman losing a large amount of blood and thus a large 
          amount of the iron stored in the body. It has also been proven that 
          many women suffer infections of the uterus as a result of using the 
          coil. Despite all this, a woman may become pregnant with the coil in 
          place, as has happened to a number of women. We ask Allaah to keep us 
          safe and sound.

21170,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21170,He wants to pray the obligatory prayers only and not the naafil prayers,Can I just pray the obligatory prayers only and skip the non-obligatory prayers.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Observing the naafil (supererogatory) prayers and offering them regularly is one of the greatest means of earning the love of Allaah and it brings Paradise and divine mercy. Al-Bukhaari narrated (6502) that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, Allah says: “Whosoever shows enmity to someone devoted to Me, I shall be at war with him. My servant draws not near to Me with anything more loved by Me than thereligious duties I have enjoined upon him, and My servant continues to draw nearto Me with supererogatory works so that I shall love him. When I love him I am hishearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with whichhe strikes and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask [something] of Me, Iwould surely give it to him, and were he to ask Me for refuge, I would surely grant him it. I do not hesitate about anything as much as I hesitate about [seizing] thesoul of My faithful servant: he hates death and I hate hurting him.”  
So the Muslim should be very ambitious and keen, and should not accept anything less than that; rather he should seek to carry out his religious duties completely and perfectly, as he is required to do with regard to his worldly duties. 
However, if a Muslim restricts himself to doing only the obligatory duties, in prayer and in other matters, and does not fall short in any of that, there is no sin on him, even though neglecting the Sunnahs in general is something blameworthy according to the scholars and Imam Ahmad said: “Whoever does not pray Witr is a bad man whose testimony should not be accepted.” 
Al-Bukhaari (46) and Muslim (110) narrated that Talhah ibn ‘Ubayd-Allaah said: A man came to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and when he drew close to him he asked him about Islam. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Five prayers each day and night.” He said: “Do I have to do anything else?” He said: “No, not unless you do it voluntarily.” And the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “And fasting Ramadaan.” He said: “Do I have to do anything else?” He said: “No, not unless you do it voluntarily.” And the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told him about zakaah. He said: “Do I have to do anything else?” He said: “No, not unless you do it voluntarily.” The man left, saying, “By Allaah, I will not do any more than this or any less.” The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “He will succeed, if he is speaking the truth.” 
Al-Nawawi said: This is to be understood as meaning that he did not offer naafil prayers and he did not omit any of the obligatory prayers. Such a person will undoubtedly be successful, even though his persisting in not offering Sunnah prayers is something blameworthy for which his testimony is to be rejected. But he is not sinning thereby, rather he will be successful and will attain salvation. And Allaah knows best.  
Sharh Muslim, 1/121 
It should be noted that the naafil prayers bring immense reward and great virtue. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The first of his deeds for which a person will be brought to account on the Day of Resurrection will be his prayer. If it is sound then he will have succeeded but if it is not sound then he will be lost and doomed. If anything is lacking from his obligatory prayers, the Lord will say: ‘Look and see whether My slave has any voluntary (prayers),’ and the shortfall from his obligatory prayers will be made up from that. Then all his deeds will be dealt with in like manner.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 413; Abu Dawood, 864; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays twelve rak’ahs each day and night, a house will be built for him in Paradise because of them.” Narrated by Muslim, 728

It was narrated that Ma’qil ibn Yassaar said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “For one of you to be stabbed in the head with an iron needle is better for him than that he should touch a woman who is not permissible for him.” 
Narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Kabeer, 486. Shaykh al-Albani said in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 5045, that this hadeeth is saheeh. 
This hadeeth alone is sufficient to deter and to instill the obedience required of us by Allah, because it implies that touching women may lead to temptation and immorality. 
It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When the believing women migrated to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), they would be tested in accordance with the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘O Prophet! When believing women come to you to give you the Bay‘ah (pledge), that they will not associate anything in worship with Allah, that they will not steal, that they will not commit illegal sexual intercourse’ [al-Mumtahanah 60:12] 
‘Aa’ishah said: Whoever among the believing women agreed to that had passed the test, and when the women agreed to that, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to them: “Go, for you have given your oath of allegiance.’ No, by Allah, the hand of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) never touched the hand of any woman, rather they would give their oath of allegiance with words only.” And ‘Aa’ishah said: “By Allah, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) only took the oath of allegiance from the women in the manner prescribed by Allah, and the hand of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) never touched the hand of any woman. When he had taken their oath of allegiance he would say, ‘I have accepted your oath of allegiance verbally.’”
(narrated by Muslim, 1866) 
It was narrated from ‘Urwah that ‘Aa’ishah told him about the women’s oath of allegiance: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) never touched any woman with his hand. He would explain to the woman what the oath of allegiance implied, and when she accepted, he would say ‘Go, for you have given your oath of allegiance.’” 
Narrated by Muslim, 1866 
This infallible one, the best of mankind, the leader of the sons of Adam on the Day of Resurrection, did not touch women. This is despite the fact that the oath of allegiance was originally given by hand. So how about men other than the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? 
It was narrated that Umaymah the daughter of Raqeeqah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “I do not shake hands with women.” 
Narrated by al-Nasaa’i (4181) and Ibn Maajah, 2874; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 2513. 
Secondly: 
It is not permissible to shake hands even with a barrier in between, such as shaking hands from beneath a garment and the like. The hadeeth that was narrated allowing that is da’eef (weak). 
It was narrated from Ma’qal ibn Yassaar that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to shake hands with women from beneath a garment.” 
Narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Awsat, 2855. 
Al-Haythami said: 
This was narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Kabeer and al-Awsat. Its isnaad includes ‘Ataab ibn Harb, who is da’eef (weak). 
Majma’ al-Zawaa’id, 6/39. 
Wali al-Deen al-‘Iraaqi said: 
The words of ‘Aa’ishah, “He used to accept the women’s oath of allegiance by words only” mean that he did so without taking their hands or shaking hands with them. This indicates that the bay’ah of men was accepted by taking their hands and shaking hands with them, as well as by words, and this is how it was.  What ‘Aa’ishah mentioned was the custom.  
Some of the mufassireen mentioned that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called for a vessel of water and dipped his hand in it, then the women dipped their hands in it. And some of them said that he did not shake hands with them from behind a barrier and had a Qatari cloak over his hand. And it was said that ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) shook hands with them on his behalf. None of these reports are sound, especially the last one, How could ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) have done something that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who was ma’soom (infallible), would not do? 
Tarh al-Tathreeb, 7/45 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
The most correct view is that this (i.e., shaking hands with women from behind a barrier) is not allowed at all, because of the general meaning of the hadeeth, according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “I do not shake hands with women;” and so as to ward off the means that may lead to evil. 
(Adapted from Hashiyat Majmoo’at Rasaa’il fi’l-Hijaab wa’l-Sufoor, p. 69) 
The same ruling applies to shaking hands with old women; this is also haraam because of the general meaning of the texts on this issue. The reports that say it is permissible are da’eef (weak). 
Al-Zayla’i said: 
“As for the report that ‘Abu Bakr used to shake hands with old women, it is also ghareeb.” 
(Nasab al-Raayah, 4/240) 
Ibn Hajar said: 
I cannot find this hadeeth. 
(al-Diraayah fi Takhreej Ahaadeeth al-Hidaayah, 2/225) 
Fourthly: 
With regard to the views of the four imams, they are as follows: 
1 – The Hanafi madhhab: 
Ibn Nujaym said: 
It is not permissible for a man to touch a woman’s face or hands even if there is no risk of desire because it is haraam in principle and there is no necessity that would allow it.
 Al-Bahr al-Raa’iq, 8/219 
2 – The Maaliki madhhab: 
Muhammad ibn Ahmad (‘Ulaysh) said: 
It is not permissible for a man to touch the face or hand of a non-mahram woman, and it is not permissible for him to put his hand on hers without a barrier. ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) never accepted a woman’s oath of allegiance by shaking hands with her; rather he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to accept their oath of allegiance by words only.” According to another report, “His hand never touched the hand of a woman, rather he would accept their oath of allegiance by words only.” 
(Manh al-Jaleel Sharh Mukhtasar Khaleel, 1/223) 
3 – The Shaafa’i madhhab: 
Al-Nawawi said: 
It is not permissible to touch a woman in any way. 
Al-Majmoo’, 4/515. 
Wali al-Deen al-‘Iraaqi said: 
This indicates that the hand of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not touch the hand of any woman apart from his wives and concubines, whether in the case of accepting the oath of allegiance or in other cases. If he did not do that despite the fact that he was infallible and beyond suspicion, then it is even more essential that others heed this prohibition. It appears from the texts that he refrained from doing that because it was haraam for him to do so. The fuqaha’ among our companions and others said that it is haraam to touch a non-mahram woman even if that is not touching parts of her body that are not ‘awrah, such as her face. But they differed with regard to looking when there is no desire and no fear of fitnah. The prohibition on touching is stronger than the prohibition on looking, and it is haraam when there is no necessity that would allow it. If it is the case of necessity, e.g. medical treatment, removing a tooth or treating the eyes, etc., if there is no woman who can do that, then it is permissible for a non-mahram to do that because it is the case of necessity. 
Tarh al-Tathreeb, 7/45, 46 
4 – The Hanbali madhhab 
Ibn Muflih said: 
Abu ‘Abd-Allah – i.e., Imam Ahmad – was asked about a man who shakes hands with a woman. He said, No, and was emphatic that it is haraam. I said, Should he shake hands with her from beneath his garment? He said, No. 
Shaykh Taqiy al-Deen also favoured the view that it is prohibited, and gave the reason that touching is more serious than looking. 
AlAdaab al-Shar’iyyah, 2/257

21195,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21195,Ruling on intercourse in the bathroom,Is it permissible for a man to have intercourse with his wife without a cover? Is it permissible to have intercourse in the bathroom?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, it is permissible for a man to have intercourse with his wife without a cover, and it is also permissible to have intercourse in the bathroom, but that means that he will be going against the Sunnah by not mentioning Allah beforehand. Perhaps you know that the Sunnah, when a man wants to have intercourse with his wife, is to say, “Bismillaah, Allahumma jannibna al-Shaytaana wa jannib al-Shaytaana ma razaqtana (In the name of Allah, O Allah, keep the Shaytaan away from us and keep the Shaytaan away from that with which You may bless us).” Perhaps you also know that it is not right to mention the name of Allah in places where you relieve yourself, so how can the one who has intercourse in the bathroom recite this dhikr? Unless he is going to go out, recite this dhikr and then go back in.",Shaykh Sa’d al-Humayd
