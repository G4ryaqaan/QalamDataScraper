    upholding the ties of kinship for females","my sister who has shahada is married
      to a man who is not, at the time she didn;t know that he is haram for her. My husband will
      not allow me to visit her home because he is not muslim, it this allowed? I would just
      visit her home when he is not there",,,"Praise be to Allah.There follow some details about the issue of women
    upholding their ties of kinship, and what they should do with husbands who prevent them
    from doing so.
Upholding the ties of kinship is obligatory even for females, who must
    uphold them as much as they can. Therefore it is not permissible for a man to prevent his
    wife or daughter from upholding her ties of kinship, and if he stops her from visiting
    them, but he lets her convey greetings to them, whether by letter or through a third
    person, or send them gifts, then she should do that. It is sufficient even if she only
    sends greetings without a gift, but if she sends her greetings with a gift, that is
    better. If he stops her from sending a gift but allows her to send greetings, then she
    should send greetings. If he allows her to send a gift but stops her from sending
    greetings, then she should send a gift. If he allows her to go and see them, then she
    should go. If he stops her from doing anything that comes under the heading of upholding
    ties of kinship, then there is no obedience to any created being if it involves
    disobedience to the Creator. In this case she should maintain her family ties in the way
    that is least objectionable to her husband or father, whether it is sending gifts or
    conveying greetings, and she can conceal that if she is fearful. If her relatives are
    faced with some hardship, she should help them with what they need, even if he says not
    to. She should uphold her family ties by offering condolences in the case of bereavement
    or loss, and condolence means advising patience. She should also congratulate them on
    joyful occasions, and congratulating them means praying that they will enjoy to the full
    whatever has brought them joy, and that it will not be spoilt for them. Such joyful events
    include the return of a traveller, a wedding, etc. She should not adorn herself or display
    her adornment in front of those to whom she should not show herself, such as cousins (sons
    of maternal uncles or paternal uncles), and she should convey her greetings to them from
    behind a barrier and without making her voice soft, but this is only in cases where there
    is no fear of fitnah, otherwise she may convey greetings through a third party. She does
    not have to attend funerals.
It is not permissible for the husband to stop his wife from upholding the
    ties of kinship even if it involves her going out, but she should not go out except with
    his permission. The same applies to fathers. The wife should treat her husband gently so
    that she will still be able to fulfil her shar’i duty of upholding the ties of
    kinship. We ask Allaah to put all our affairs in order.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

“Labbayk (here I am) on behalf of Shubrumah” [i.e., he was performing Hajj on behalf of Shubrumah].

If it is, I would like to try to follow the practice (I am in the 9th month of my 4th pregnancy).  However, I have also been told it is a bid'ah practice and therefore I should avoid it.  Please try to clear up this issue, which I have been researching for almost 6 years!","It is permissible in Islam for women to go out during the 40 days of nifas to any place she wants, so long as she fulfils the Shar’i conditions (i.e., hijab etc.)","40-Day Rule after Birth in Islam


Can women go out during the nifas period?","Praise be to Allah.40-Day Rule after Birth in Islam
Forty days is the longest period that the woman in nifas can refrain from praying and fasting , so long as blood is still flowing. After that, she should do ghusl and pray, and consider herself to be in a state of istihadah (irregular vaginal bleeding which is neither menstruation nor nifas) if the bleeding does not stop. 
Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “At the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the woman in nifas would sit (i.e., refrain from praying and fasting) for forty days…” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi). 
Can women go out during the nifas period?
With regard to the belief that a woman has to stay in her house for forty days after giving birth and not go out, this is a mistaken belief and women do not have to do this. It is permissible for them to go out during these forty days to any place she wants, so long as she fulfills the shar’i conditions (i.e., hijab etc.)

1485,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1485,Finding Noah’s ark,"Assalaamualaikum, I have heard that Noah's ark was found a few years ago using 
references from the Quraán as opposed to the bible. Is this true?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""The people of Nuh denied (their Messenger) before them, they rejected Our slave, and said: 
A madman! and he was insolently rebuked and threatened.
Then he invoked his Lord (saying): I have been overcome, so help (me)!
So We opened the gates of heaven with water pouring forth.
And We caused the earth to gush forth with springs. So the waters (of the heaven and the 
earth) met for a matter predestined.
And We carried him on a (ship) made of planks and nails,
Floating under Our Eyes, a reward for him who had been rejected!
And, indeed, We have left this as a sign, is there then any that will remember (or receive 
admonition)?
Then how (terrible) was My Torment and My Warnings!""
[al-Qamar 54:9-16]
In his Tafseer, Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: ""And, indeed, We have left 
this as a sign, is there then any that will remember (or receive admonition)? refers to this story, 
which serves as a lesson."" It was also suggested that it referred to the ship or ark itself, which 
was left so that those who came after the people of Nuh might learn lessons from it and not 
reject the Messengers. Qutaadah said: ""Allaah left it in Baaqirdi in the Arabian Peninsula (a 
place in Iraq), as a lesson and a sign, so that the first generations of this ummah would see it. 
How many ships have there been after it that have turned to dust and left no trace!""
The apparent meaning is that this refers to ships in general, as in the aayaat (interpretation of the 
meaning):
""And an aayah (sign) for them is that We bore their offspring in the laden ship (of Nuh),
And We have created for them of the like thereunto, so on them they ride.""
Yaa-Seen 36:41-42]
""Verily! When the water rose beyond its limits [Nuhs Flood], We carried you [mankind] in 
the floating (ship that was constructed by Nuh).
That We might make it a remembrance for you, and the keen ear (person) may (hear and) 
understand it.""
[al-Haaqqah 69:11-12]
Hence Allaah says here ""is there then any that will remember (or receive admonition)?"" i.e., is 
there anyone who will remember and learn?
In his tafseer of the words ""We have left this as a sign"" Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on 
him, mentions three opinions:
1.	That Allaah has left this story as a lesson to those who come after the people of Nuh;
2.	That Allaah has left the ship of Nuh so that subsequent nations may see it and learn from it 
how Allaah saved the believers and destroyed the kuffaar.
3.	That Allaah taught mankind how to make ships and left this invention as a reminder of His 
blessings and how Nuhs children and the believers were saved by means of a ship like those 
which are well-known.
In any case, there is nothing that would go against either Islamic teaching or reason if Nuhs ark 
were to be discovered and if generations of mankind after Nuh were to see it, because it would 
be a sign to them. The issue would be how to prove that the ship discovered was really Nuhs 
ark; not everyone who finds an ancient ship and claims it to be Nuhs ark is to be believed.

Wa-alaikum",,,"Praise be to Allah.
The answer to your question may be found in the ahaadeeth of Saheeh al-Bukhaari 
and the commentary of al-Haafiz al-‘Asqallaani, which are quoted below:
‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: ""The Prophet 
 (peace and 
blessings of Allaah be upon him) married me when I was six years old. Then we came 
to Madeenah and stayed in Bani al-Haarith ibn Khazraj. I fell ill and my hair started to fall out (due to the illness; then it grew back thick again). My mother Umm Roomaan came to me whilst I 
was on a swing and my friends were with me. She shouted for me and I came to her, 
not knowing what she wanted. She took me by the hand and led me to the door of the 
house. I was out of breath and we waited until I had calmed down, then she took 
some water and wiped my face and head, then took me inside. There were some 
women of the Ansaar in the house, and they said: "" ‘Alaa al-khayri wa’l-baraka wa ‘ala 
khayri taa’ir (blessings, best wishes, etc)."" My mother handed me over to them and 
they tidied me up, then suddenly the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of 
Allaah be upon him) was there. It was mid-morning, and they handed me over to him. 
At that time I was nine years old."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3605).
‘Urwah said: ""Khadeejah died three years before the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings 
of Allaah be upon him) migrated to Madeenah. He stayed alone for two years or 
thereabouts, then he married ‘Aa’ishah when she was six years old, and consummated 
the marriage when she was nine years old."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3607)
The phrase ""he married ‘Aa’ishah"" means that the marriage contract was drawn up; 
the marriage was consummated later on, when she was nine.
Muslim reports from al-Zuhri, from ‘Urwah, that ‘Aa’ishah said that she was taken to 
him when she was nine years old, and she took her toys with her. He died when she 
was eighteen years old. Muslim also reports a similar account from ‘Aa’ishah via 
al-Aswad. He reports from ‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Urwah from his father that ‘Aa’ishah said: 
""The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married me 
in Shawwaal and consummated the marriage with me in Shawwaal.""
‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said that the Prophet 
 (peace and 
blessings of Allaah be upon him) married her when she was six years old and 
consummated the marriage when she was nine years old, and she stayed with him for 
nine years."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4738)
Al-Bukhaari calls this chapter of his Saheeh ""Baab inkaah al-rajul wuldahu (or 
waladahu) al-sighaar (Chapter on a man marrying off his young children)."" The fact 
that Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
"". . . and for those who have no courses [periods] [(i.e., they are still immature) 
their ‘iddah is three months likewise, except in case of death] . . ."" [al-Talaaq 65:4]
is an indication that it is permissible to marry girls below the age of adolescence. This 
is a good understanding, but the aayah makes no specific mention of either the father 
or the young girl. It could be said that the basic principle concerning marrying children 
is that it is forbidden unless there is specific evidence (daleel) to indicate otherwise. 
The hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah states that her father Abu Bakr married her off before the 
age of puberty, but there is no other evidence apart from that, so the rule applies to all 
other cases.
Al- Muhallab said: ""[The scholars] agreed that it is permissible for a father to marry 
off his young virgin daughter, even though it is not usually the case to have intercourse 
with such a young woman.""(The above was summarized from Fath al-Baari Sharh ‘ala Saheeh al-Bukhaari)
In summary, then, it is permitted to contract marriage with a young girl and to hand 
her over to her husband to stay with him before she reaches adolescence. As for 
consummating the marriage, this does not happen until she is physically able for it. 
Thus the matter becomes quite clear. Do you see anything wrong with a man living 
with his young wife in one house, bringing her up and teaching her, but delaying 
consummation until she is ready for it? We ask Allaah to show us truth and falsehood 
and to make each clear. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
1496,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1496,"Conditions of
women’s niqaab","Is the niqab a pre-islamic custom if not
      what is the evidence (qur'an or hadith) to support the wearing of niqab, and is it
      preferred for sisters to wear the niqab? jazakumallaahu khairan.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We have already spoken about the fact that it is obligatory for 
  women to cover their faces in Question #2198, 
  so please refer to that question.
With regard to the niqaab, this is a cover or veil 
  with a hole in it for the eyes. It is a way of dressing that was known to Muslim 
  women at the beginning of Islam, and it is mentioned in the hadeeth of the Prophet 
   (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in 
  which he mentions what women in ihraam (for Hajj or Umrah) are not allowed 
  to do. He said: The woman in ihraam should not cover her face with a veil 
  or wear gloves. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 1707). 
  Some of the scholars mentioned that a woman may uncover her left eye in order 
  to see where she is going, and if necessary she may uncover both eyes. The opening 
  should only be wide enough for the eyes, and the woman should beware of wearing 
  a niqaab with wide openings lest the beauty of her eyes becomes apparent and 
  the niqaab becomes a means of temptation instead of a veil covering her beauty 
  and adornment.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
1497,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1497,Manners when talking to women,"I have heard a ruling regarding the reasons a male Muslims is allowed to speak to a Muslim female and want to know if it is correct. It said that there are only five reasons one may talk to her:
1. to ask how her family
2. for medical purposes
3. for financial purposes (e.g. in a shop)
4. to find out about her personality for marriage suitability
5. to give her dawah (Islamic knowledge).
Is this correct? If it is, please provide the evidence from where the ruling is made (i.e. Daleel).",,,"Praise be to Allah.The conditions for speaking to a woman to whom one is not related are mentioned in the following aayaat (interpretation of the meaning):
"". . . And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen; that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts . . ."" [Al-Ahzaab 33:53]
"". . . then be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner."" [Al-Ahzaab 33:32]
Ibn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his Tafseer: ""This means that they should not speak softly. Allah commanded them to speak in a concise and decisive manner (i.e., they should be serious and brief in their speech, and not be vague or talk aimlessly). There should be no possible indication on the face that could be taken to indicate any softness in the heart, as the Arab women (before Islam) used to do when speaking to men, by making their voices soft like women who are taking care of small children, or like prostitutes. Allah forbade women to do that.
The phrase ""lest he in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire"" means lest such a person should hope for immoral deeds, indecency or romance. ""Speaking in an honourable manner"" means speaking in a way that does not go against Sharee’ah or offend people. Women are encouraged when speaking to men to whom they are not related and to mahrams among their in-laws to be somewhat rough or abrupt in their speech, without raising the voice, because they are commanded to lower their voice.
Speaking with a woman to whom one is not related (i.e., not mahram) should only be for a specific need, such as asking a question, buying or selling, asking about the head of the household, and so on. Such conversations should be brief, with nothing doubtful in either what is said or how it is said.
The idea of limiting speech with women to the five instances mentioned in the question needs to be approached with caution, because they could be taken as examples instead of limits. One must also adhere to the conditions set out by the Sharee’ah even in instances where such conversations are necessary, such as in da’wah, giving fatwas, buying or selling, etc.
And Allah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
