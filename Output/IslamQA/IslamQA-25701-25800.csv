     If she wears it for the purpose of adornment among other 
    women or her mahram relatives, that is subject to the condition that it 
    should not resemble the dress of men or of kaafir women. But if she goes out 
    wearing it in front of non-mahram men, this is a kind of tabarruj (wanton 
    display), and Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

    “and do not 
    display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance”

    [al-Ahzaab 33:33]

    “Everything which involves 
    wanton display or makes a woman stand out among other women in a manner that 
    involves beautification is haraam and is not permissible for her.”","See Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, vol. 2, p. 828"
25768,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/25768,Can You Share Your Dreams?,"I hope you could help me out with this confusion, I had prayed Istikhara prayer 5 days back. I asked ALLAH if I would be able to convert a non-Muslim to a Muslim and guide him to the right path for my love for Islam and ALLAH, I am very obsessed with this because it's my dying wish that I should be able to do this at  least once in my lifetime, because I love ALLAH dearly and with all my heart. I had prayed istikhra prayer asking ALLAH if I will ever be successful in executing this dream into reality, I also asked if he would guide me. But today morning, I had a dream were I saw me and my cousin spending our holidays in a hotel and I found both me and my cousin holding a green color champagne bottle and that we were both tempted to taste it as we do. And after a while later I see my elder brother coming in and both me and my cousin get terrified and scared. Then I see my elder sister in a black salwar and that a brown dog is chasing her.
Imam saheb when I was dreaming I was getting really scared and I also feared that I committed a sin and then when I opened my eyes and got up from the left position (the position in which I was sleeping), I felt relieved that it was just a dream.
It was 5.30am at that time and I had to rush for fajr prayers, but as I was praying I felt really happy and had this beautiful feeling inside of me, that was convincing me that ALLAH is with me and listening to my heart. I never had such a lovely feeling, and I feel happy even now as I'm writing to you.
I don't know what this means, should I believe in the dream or should I listen to my heart?","•	Abu Sa’id al-Khudri narrated that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “If any one of you sees a dream that he likes, it is from Allah, so let him praise Allah for it and tell people about it. But if he sees something other than that, that he dislikes, it is from the Shaitan, so let him seek refuge with Allah from its evil and not mention it to anyone, for it will not harm him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 7045)","Types of dreams in Islam


Types of confused dreams


Types of what people see in their dreams


Can you share your dreams?


Should we share our bad dreams with others?","Praise be to Allah.Types of dreams in Islam
Note that the things people see in their sleep may come under one of two categories: 

Dreams /visions 
Confused dreams 

Types of confused dreams
Confused dreams in turn are divided into two categories: 

 The Shaitan’s attempts to frighten 
The workings of the subconscious. 

Types of what people see in their dreams
So it may be said that what people see in their dreams may be divided into three categories: 

Visions or dreams that come from Allah.
Attempts by the Shaitan to frighten us
The workings of the subconscious.

These categories are indicated by the hadith narrated in Sahih Muslim (no. 2263) from Abu Hurayrah, which says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When the time (of the Day of Resurrection) draws near, a believer's dream will hardly be false. And the truest vision will be of one who is himself the most truthful in speech, for the vision of a Muslim is the forty-fifth part of Prophecy, and dreams are of three types:

the good dream which is glad tidings from Allah;
the bad dream which causes distress, which is from the Shaitan;
and the dream which represents what a person is thinking about.

So if any one of you sees a dream which he does not like he should get up and pray, and not tell people about his dream…” 
‘Awf ibn Malik narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Dreams are of three types: some are terrifying things from the Shaitan, aimed at causing grief to the son of Adam; some are things that a person is concerned with when he is awake, so he sees them in his dreams; and some are a part of the forty-six parts of Prophecy.” (Sahih Sunan Ibn Majah, 3155) 
Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Dreams are of three types: glad tidings from Allah, what is on a person’s mind, and frightening dreams from the Shaitan. If any of you sees a dream that he likes, let him tell others of it if he wishes, but if he sees something that he dislikes, he should not tell anyone about it, and he should get up and pray.” (Sahih Sunan Ibn Majah, 3154) 
Can you share your dreams?
There follow a number of sahih hadiths which describe how to deal with what one sees in one’s dream. 

Abu Qatadah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Good dreams come from Allah and bad dreams come from the Shaitan. If anyone sees a bad dream that scares him, let him spit drily to his left and seek refuge with Allah from its evil, then it will not harm him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3292) 
Abu Salamah said: I used to see such terrible dreams that I began to shake and have a fever, but did not cover myself with a cloak until I met Abu Qatadah, and I mentioned that to him. He said, “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, ‘Good dreams come from Allah and bad dreams come from the Shaitan. If anyone sees a bad dream that he dislikes, let him spit drily to his left three times and seek refuge with Allah from its evil, then it will not harm him.’” (Narrated by Muslim, 2261) 
Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If any one of you sees a dream that he dislikes, let him turn over, and spit drily to his left three times and ask Allah of His goodness, and seek refuge with Him from its evil.” (Sahih Sunan Ibn Majah) 
Jabir narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If any one of you sees a dream that he dislikes, let him spit drily to his left three times and seek refuge with Allah from the Shaitan three times, and turn over onto his other side.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2262). 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us the difference between good dreams and bad dreams. Abu Sa’id al-Khudri narrated that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “If any one of you sees a dream that he likes, it is from Allah, so let him praise Allah for it and tell people about it. But if he sees something other than that, that he dislikes, it is from the Shaitan, so let him seek refuge with Allah from its evil and not mention it to anyone, for it will not harm him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 7045)  

So it is clear that good dreams come from Allah and bad dreams which a person dislikes come from the Shaitan, so he has to seek refuge with Allah from their evil. 

Abu Hurayrah said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If any one of you sees something that he dislikes, let him get up and pray, and not tell people about it.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2263). 
Jabir narrated that a Bedouin came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, “I dreamt that my head was cut off and I was chasing it.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) rebuked him and said: “Do not tell anyone how the Shaitan is messing about with you in your dreams.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2268) 

Should we share our bad dreams with others?
So we may sum up from these hadiths the most important points about what a person should do if he sees a dream that he dislikes, as follows: 

He should know that this dream is from the Shaitan who wants to cause him grief, so he should annoy the Shaitan by not paying any attention to him.
He should seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaitan.
He should seek refuge with Allah from the evil of this dream.
He should spit drily to his left three times, i.e., blowing with a little bit of saliva.
He should not tell anyone about it.
He should turn over from the side on which he was sleeping, so if he was lying on his left side he should turn over to his right side, and vice versa.
He should get up and pray.

If a person adheres to this etiquette, then we hope that this bad dream will not harm him, as it says in the texts.

25778,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/25778,How to Remove Bad Thoughts About Allah,"When I do Salah (formal prayers) or intend to do good deeds I often get very evil thoughts in my mind.

Bad thoughts about Allah: Clear sign of faith


How to get rid of bad thoughts about Allah","Praise be to Allah.Bad thoughts are from Satan
Evil whispers during prayer and at other times come from the Shaytan, who is keen to misguide the Muslim and deprive him of good and keep it far away from him. One of the Companions complained to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about waswas during prayer , and he said: “The Shaytan comes between me and my prayers and my recitation, confusing me therein.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “That is a devil called Khanzab. If he affects you, seek refuge in Allah from him and spit drily to your left three times.” He (the Companion) said, I did that and Allah took him away from me. (Narrated by Muslim, 2203) 
Tips on how to develop khushu` in prayer
Proper focus (khushu`) is the essence of prayer . Prayer without proper focus is like a body without a soul. The following are two of the things that help one to develop the proper focus: 

Striving to think about what you are saying and doing, pondering the meanings of the Quran, dhikr (words of remembrance) and du’as (supplications) that you are reciting; bearing in mind that you are conversing with Allah as if you can see Him. For when the worshipper stands to pray, he is speaking to his Lord, and ihsan (perfection of worship) means worshipping Allah as if you are seeing Him, and knowing that even though you cannot see Him, He sees you. Every time a person experiences the sweetness of prayer, he will be more inclined to do it. This depends on the level of one's faith – and there are many means of strengthening one’s faith. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Of the things of your world, women and perfume have been made dear to me, and my joy is in prayer.” According to another hadith he said, “Give us our rest through it, O Bilal (ie. with prayer),” and he did not say, ``Give us a break from it.”

Striving to ward off the things that may distract you during prayer, namely thinking about things that are irrelevant or distracting. Waswas affects each person differently, because waswas has to do with a person’s level of doubts and desires and the degree to which a person is attached to other things or fears other things. (From Majmu’ Fatawa Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, 22/605) 
Bad thoughts about Allah: Clear sign of faith
With regard to what you say about the waswas reaching such a great level that you have begun to experience waswas that makes you think about Allah in ways that are not appropriate, these are evil whispers from the Shaytan. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And if there comes to you from Satan an evil suggestion, then seek refuge in Allah. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Knowing. (Fussilat 41:36)
Some of the Companions complained about the waswas that was bothering them. Some of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said to him, ‘We find in ourselves thoughts that are too terrible to speak of.’ He said, ‘Are you really having such thoughts?’ They said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘That is a clear sign of faith.’” (Narrated by Muslim, 132 from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah).
Al-Nawawi said in his commentary on this hadith (prophetic tradition): “The Prophet’s words, ‘That is a clear sign of faith’ mean, the fact that you think of this waswas as something terrible is a clear sign of faith, for if you dare not utter it and you are so afraid of it and of speaking of it, let alone believing it, this is the sign of one who has achieved perfect faith and who is free of doubt.” 
And it was said that what it means is that the Shaytan only whispers to those whom he despairs of tempting, because he is unable to tempt them. As for the non-Muslim, he can approach him in any manner he wants and is not restricted to waswas, rather he can play with him however he wants. Based on this, what the hadith means is that the cause of waswas is pure faith, or that waswas is a sign of pure faith. Please see question no. 12315 .  
The fact that you hate that and your heart recoils from it is a clear sign of faith. Waswas happens to everyone who turns to Allah by reciting dhikr etc. It is inevitable, but you have to be steadfast and patient, and persevere with your dhikr and prayer, and not give up, because in this way you will ward off the plot of the Shaytan. Indeed, the plot of Satan has ever been weak. Every time a person wants to turn to Allah, waswas brings other matters to mind. The Shaytan is like a bandit: every time a person wants to proceed towards Allah, he wants to block the way. Hence when it was said to one of the salaf (pious predecessors) that the Jews and Christians say, “We do not experience waswas,” he said, “They are speaking the truth, for what would the Shaytan do with a house in ruins?” (Fatawa Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, 22/608)
How to get rid of bad thoughts about Allah

If you feel that you are being affected by this waswas , say, “Amantu Billahi wa Rasulihi (I believe in Allah and His Messenger).” `Aishah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Shaytan comes to one of you and says, ‘Who created you?’ And he says ‘Allah.’ Then the Shaytan says, ‘Who created Allah? ’ If that happens to any one of you, let him say, Amantu Billahi wa Rusulihi (I believe in Allah and His messengers). Then that will go away from him.”(Narrated by Ahmad, 25671; classed as hasan (sound) by al-Albani in al-Sahihah, 116) 
Try to stop thinking about that as much as possible, and keep busy with things that will distract you from it. 
Finally, we advise you to keep on turning to Allah in all situations, and to ask Him for help, and to beseech Him, and to ask Him to make you steadfast until death, and to cause you to die doing righteous deeds.

25786,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/25786,Does a son have to spend on his father even if he is rich?,"My husband’s father helped my husband to get married, then my husband traveled to one of the Gulf countries for work. Because he has many debts that he wants to pay off, he is not sending any money to his father. 

Now his father is demanding the money that he spent to get him married, even though my father-in-law is a doctor and has a good income that is more than enough. 

My question is: 

Is it not the father’s obligation to get his son married? What should be done in this situation?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The father is obliged to get his son married 
    if the father is rich and the son is poor and cannot afford to get married, because marriage is part of the obligatory spending. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but the father of the child shall bear 
    the cost of the mother’s food and clothing on a reasonable basis”
[al-Baqarah 2:233]
So the father has to get his sons married if 
    he is able to and they cannot afford it. He has to spend on them with regard to food, drink, education etc, because spending is obligatory upon 
    the father. 
Secondly: 
The son does not have to spend on his father 
    unless two conditions are met: 
1 – The son is rich (i.e., he has what he 
    needs and more) 
2 – The father is poor. 
If these two conditions are met, then the son 
    is obliged to spend on his father. Here the questioner mentions that her father-in-law is a doctor and that his income is good. If that is the 
    case then the son is not obliged to spend on him. But if the father asks his son for something, even if he is rich, and the son does not need that 
    wealth and will not be affected by giving it to his father, then he should give it to his father lest he be regarded as being disobedient towards 
    his father. But if the son needs that money, he does not have to give it to his father; he should explain to his father the financial difficulty 
    that he is facing [?} and that after he had paid off his debts and has become financially stable he will send money to his father as much as he 
    can.

There is a girl who got engaged and she went out with her fiancé and exchanged many letters with him. I advised her not to do that because Islam forbids it, but she did not pay any heed. Then she surprised everyone by canceling the engagement but she did not give any reason. Is it permissible for her to do that?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
A woman should choose a righteous man for her husband; it is not permissible for a guardian to reject a man who is religiously committed and of good character, if he comes seeking marriage to a female relative under his care. 
For more details on the qualities of a righteous husband, please see the answer to question no. 5202 and 6942. 
A man must also make a good choice of a wife. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) advised men to marry women who are religiously committed, for a righteous woman will protect a man’s house, wealth and children. 
For more details on the qualities of a righteous wife, please see the answers to questions no. 26744 and 10376. 
Secondly: 
Engagement is no more than a promise to marry. The fiancé is still a non-mahram to his fiancée and it is not permissible for him to be alone with her, shake hands with her or go out with her. 
This young woman and this young man have to repent to Allaah for the sins that they have committed. What happened is not surprising, because both of them got engaged without adhering to the Islamic rulings. 
Thirdly: 
With regard to her canceling the engagement, it says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (18/69): An engagement between a man and woman is not equivalent to a marriage contract. Either the man or the woman may cancel the engagement if they think it is better to do so, whether the other party agrees or not. 
Finally: 
The sister should note the danger of corresponding and conversing with the opposite sex, because this may lead to many negative consequences. The internet is full of stories of women who were careless about such matters to the extent that they lost their honour, and women who did such things because they thought it was just for fun or that they would be able to protect themselves, but they quickly fell into the wolf’s lair.
