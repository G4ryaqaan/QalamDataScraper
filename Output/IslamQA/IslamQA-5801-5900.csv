5809,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5809,Praying in a light thobe,What is the ruling on praying in thin clothes which show a little of what is beneath them and through which the size of the body can be seen?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.If the thobe [men’s garment, a long white robe as worn in Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries] is so thin that the colour of the skin beneath it can be seen, then you cannot pray wearing it, because it does not cover the ‘awrah properly. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about that and said: 
If the thobe in question does not conceal the skin because it is thin or light, then a man cannot pray in it unless he is wearing trousers or an izaar [lower garment like a sarong] underneath it to cover the area between the navel and the knees). 
A woman cannot pray in light or thin clothes unless she is wearing something underneath that covers the entire body. 
Short pants underneath the thobe in question are not sufficient. 
If a man prays in such a thobe he should also wear a undershirt or something else to cover the shoulders, or one of the them, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one of you should pray in a single garment with nothing on his shoulders.” (Saheeh – agreed upon). 
Fatawa Islamiyyah, 1/219 
But if the thobe covers the skin and shows nothing of its colour, but it is so thin or tight that it shows the size of the limbs, this does not affect the prayer, so long as the ‘awrah is covered. 
Ibn Qudaamah said: It is obligatory to cover with something that conceals the colour of the skin; if it is so light that the colour of the skin can be seen through it, so that it can be seen if the skin is white or red, then it is not permissible to pray in it, because that does not cover properly. If it conceals the colour but shows the shape, it is permissible to pray in it, because this cannot be avoided.

5842,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5842,How to pray and fast in countries where the day or night is continuous,"Due to the inclination of the earth's axis of rotation, regions nearest to one pole experience continuous day for some months, for example, the trading city of Tromso (about 50000 inhabitants) in northern Norway (in which 0.4% of its population comes from islamic countries) where the sun is visible continuously from late May to late July, while regions nearest to the other pole experience continuous night during that same period. How do muslims living in Tromso do for maghrib and esha salaat as night never falls during these few monthes and also given that the month of Ramadhan falls during this period, how can they fast?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Fatwa no. 2769 was issued by the Council of 
    Senior Scholars and the Standing Committee concerning an issue similar to the one you are asking about. This is the text of the question and 
    answer: 
alone and blessings and 
    peace be upon the one after whom there will be no Prophet. 
    The Standing Committee for Academic Research 
    and Issuing Fatwas has read the question that has been sent to the General Secretary by the Secretary the Union of Muslim Students in Holland, and 
    which has been passed to them by the Secretary of the Council of Senior Scholars. The text of the question is as follows: 
We hope that you can provide us with a fatwa 
    concerning the way of determining the times of Maghrib, Isha’ and Fajr prayer, and also the first day of Ramadaan and the first day of Eid 
    al-Fitr. That is because the way the sun rises and sets in the countries of Northern Europe that are close to the North Pole is different from the 
    way it rises and sets in the eastern Muslim countries. The reason for that has to do with the timing of the end of the red and white twilight. It 
    may be noted that in summer the white twilight lasts almost the whole night, so it is difficult to determine the time of ‘Isha’ and the onset of 
    the dawn. 
They replied: 
The Council of Senior Scholars in the Kingdom 
    of Saudi Arabia issued a statement on the determining of the times of prayer, determining the start of dawn each day, and the end of the dawn in 
    Ramadan, in countries such as yours. This is what it said: 
After studying, researching and discussing 
    the matter, the Council decided the following: 
Whoever resides in a country where the night 
    can be distinguished from the day by the onset of dawn and the setting of the sun, but the day is extremely long in the summer and extremely short 
    in the winter, is obliged to perform the five daily prayers at the times known in sharee’ah. That is because of the general meaning of the words 
    of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Perform As‑Salaat (Iqamaat‑as‑Salaat) from mid‑day till the darkness of the night (i.e. 
    the Zuhr, ‘Asr, Maghrib, and ‘Ishaa’ prayers), and recite the Qur’aan in the early dawn (i.e. the — Fajr morning prayer). Verily, the recitation 
    of the Qur’aan in the early dawn (i.e. the morning — Fajr prayer) is ever witnessed (attended by the angels in charge of mankind of the day and 
    the night)”
[al-Isra’ 17:78] 
“Verily, As‑Salaah (the prayer) is 
    enjoined on the believers at fixed hours”
[al-Nisa’ 4:103]
And because it was proven from Buraydah (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him) that a man asked the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about the times of the prayers, and he 
    said to him: “Pray with us for these two” meaning two days. When the sun passed its zenith, he told Bilaal to give the adhaan, then he told him to 
    give the iqaamah for Zuhr. Then he told him to give the iqaamah for ‘Asr when the sun was still high and clear white. Then he told him to give the 
    iqaamah for Maghrib when the sun had set. Then he told him to give the iqaamah for ‘Isha’ when the red afterglow (twilight) had disappeared.  Then 
    he told him to give the iqaamah for Fajr when the dawn had appeared. Then on the second day, he told him to delay Zuhr until the extreme heat had 
    passed and he did so. He prayed ‘Asr when the sun was high, delaying it beyond the time he had previously performed it. He prayed Maghrib before 
    the twilight had vanished; he prayed ‘Isha’ when a third of the night had passed; and he prayed Fajr when there was clear daylight. Then he said: 
    “Where is the man who was asking about the time of prayer?” The man said, “Here I am, O Messenger of Allaah.” The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The time for your prayer is within the limits of what you have seen.” 
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim) 
It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr ibn 
    al-‘Aas that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The time for Zuhr is from when the sun has passed its 
    zenith and a man’s shadow is equal in length to his height, until the time for ‘Asr comes. The time for ‘Asr lasts until the sun turns yellow. The 
    time for Maghrib lasts until the twilight has faded. The time for ‘Isha’ lasts until midnight. The time for Subh (Fajr) prayer lasts from the 
    beginning of the pre-dawn so long as the sun has not yet started to rise. When the sun starts to rise then stop praying, for it rises between the 
    two horns of the Shaytaan.”  
Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh. 
And there are other ahaadeeth which have been 
    narrated concerning the definition of the times of the five daily prayers through the words and actions of the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him). It makes no difference whether the night and day are long or short, so long as the times of the prayers can be 
    distinguished by the signs which were identified by the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
This is with regard to the timings of the 
    prayers. With regard to the timings of their fast in Ramadaan, those who are accountable should refrain from food, drink and everything else that 
    invalidates the fast each day of Ramadaan, from the time of dawn until sunset in their countries, so long as the night can be distinguished from 
    the day, and when day and night together add up to twenty-four hours. It is permissible for them to eat, drink, have intercourse, etc during the 
    night only, even if it is short. The sharee’ah of Islam is universal and applies to all people in all countries. Allaah says (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 
“and eat and drink until the white thread 
    (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your Sawm (fast) till the nightfall”
[al-Baqarah 2:187]
Whoever is unable to complete the fast because the day is so 
    long, or who knows from experience or from the advice of a competent. trustworthy doctor, or thinks it most likely that fasting will lead to his 
    death or make him severely ill, or will make his sickness worse or impede his recovery, may break his fast and make up the days that he misses in 
    a month when he can make them up. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So whoever of you sights (the crescent on 
    the first night of) the month (of Ramadan i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Sawm (fasts) that month, and whoever is ill or on a 
    journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days”
[al-Baqarah 2:185] 
“Allaah burdens not a person beyond his 
    scope”
[al-Baqarah 2:286]
“Allaah does not want to place you in 
    difficulty”
[al-Maa'idah 5:6]
Secondly: 
Whoever lives in a land in which the sun does 
    not set during the summer and does not rise during the winter, or who lives in a land in which the day lasts for six months and the night lasts 
    for six months, for example, has to perform the five daily prayers in each twenty-four hour period. They should estimate their times based on the 
    nearest country in which the times of the five daily prayers can be distinguished from one another, because it was proven in the hadeeth of the 
    Isra’ and Mi’raaj (Prophet’s Night Journey and Ascent into Heaven) that Allaah enjoined on this ummah fifty prayers each day and night, then the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) kept asking his Lord to reduce it until He said, “O Muhammad, they are five prayers each 
    day and night, and for each prayer will be the reward of ten, that is fifty prayers…” 
And it was proven in the hadeeth of Talhah 
    ibn ‘Ubayd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he said: A man from Najd with unkempt hair came to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and we heard his loud voice but could not understand what he was saying, till he came near and then we came to 
    know that he was asking about Islam. The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “(You have to offer) five 
    prayers each day and night.” The man asked, “Do I have to do anything else?” The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said, “No, unless you want to offer voluntary (naafil) prayers”… 
And it was proven in the hadeeth of Anas ibn 
    Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he said: We were forbidden to ask the Messenger of Allaah (S)  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) about anything, so we used to like it when an intelligent man from among the desert people came and asked him a question in our hearing. 
    A man from among the desert people came and said, “O Muhammad, your messenger came to us and said that you claim that Allaah sent you.” He said, 
    “He spoke the truth.” … The man said, “And your messenger claimed that we have to offer five prayers each day and night.” The Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “He spoke the truth.” The man said, “By the One Who sent you, has Allaah enjoined that upon you?” He 
    said, “Yes.” … 
It was proven that the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told his companions about the Dajjaal (antichrist). He was asked how long he would stay on earth, and he 
    said, “Forty days, one day like a year, one day like a month, one day like a week and the rest like your days.” It was said, “O Messenger of 
    Allaah, the day which is like a year, will the prayers of one day be sufficient for us then?” He said, “No, estimate them.” So the day which will 
    be like a year is not regarded as one day in which only five prayers will be sufficient, rather we are obliged to offer five prayers in each 
    twenty-four hour period. He commanded them to offer the prayers at intervals as on a regular day. 
So the Muslims in the country mentioned in 
    the question have to define the times of prayer in that land, basing those times on the closest country in which the night and day can be 
    distinguished from one another and the times of the five daily prayers are known according to the signs described in sharee’ah, within each 
    twenty-four hour period. 
Similarly they also have to fast Ramadaan. 
    They can set the time for their fast and determine the beginning and end of Ramadaan and the times of starting and breaking the fast each day by 
    the dawn and sunset each day in the closest country in which night can be distinguished from day. The total period must add up to twenty-four 
    hours, because of the hadeeth of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about the Dajjaal mentioned above, in which he told 
    his companions how to determine the times of the five daily prayers. There is no difference in this regard between fasting and prayer. 
And Allaah is the Source of strength. May 
    Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.

      sign/feeling/dream whatsoever. What do they do then? And for how many days does one have
      to read this namaaz. Some people say for 3 days others say for 7.

  to be recited is the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (1109) and others from Jaabir 
  ibn Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with them both). For the commentary 
  on this hadeeth and more details, please see question #2217 
  and 410.
With regard to what some people say, then he should go 
  ahead with whatever he feels happy with, a hadeeth to this effect was 
  narrated from the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
  of Allaah be upon him)  narrated by Ibn al-Sunni  according to which 
  he said, If you are concerned about a matter, then make istikhaarah seven 
  times, praying to your Lord, then see what you feel most drawn towards, and 
  the good will be in that.
Al-Nawawi said: its isnaad is ghareeb, and it 
  includes narrators whom I do not know. (al-Adhkaar, p. 132).
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said: if this were proven, 
  it could be taken as evidence, but its isnaad is very weak (waahin jiddan). 
  (al-Fath, 11/223)
Al-Haafiz al-Iraaqi said: it contains a narrator who 
  is known to be daeef jiddan (very weak), namely Ibraaheem ibn al-Baraa.. 
  Therefore the hadeeth is daeef jiddan. (al-Futoohaat al-Rabbaaniyyah, 
  3/357)
The correct view is that when Allaah makes something easy for 
  you  after having decreed it and accepted your duaa  
  this is a sign that it is good to go ahead and do it. The existence of obstacles 
  and difficulties is an indication that Allaah is pushing His slave away from 
  doing it. This meaning will be very clear when one ponders the meaning of the 
  hadeeth of Jaabir concerning al-istikhaarah, where the Prophet  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
 O Allaah, if You know this affair  [and 
  here he should mention it]  is good for me in relation to my religion, 
  my life, and end, then decree and facilitate it for me, and bless me with it, 
  and if You know this affair to be ill for me towards my religion, my life, and 
  end, then remove it from me and remove me from it, and decree for me what is 
  good wherever it be and make me satisfied with such.
Ibn Allaan  after transmitting the scholarly view 
  that the hadeeth of Anas is daeef (weak)  said: Therefore it was 
  said: that after (doing istikhaarah) he should do what he wants (i.e., even 
  if he does not feel that sense of being happy), because whatever happens after 
  doing istikhaarah is good
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said: Al-Haafiz Zayn al-Deen 
  al-Iraaqi said (concerning doing something after praying istikhaarah): 
  Whatever he does, there will be good in it. This is supported by what is said 
  at the end of the hadeeth of Ibn Masood according to some of its isnaads: 
  Then let him make his decision. I (Ibn Hajar) say: I have already 
  discussed above and explained that its narrators (i.e., the narrators who added 
  the phrase Then let him make his decision) are daeef (weak). But 
  this is still stronger than the narrator of that hadeeth (i.e., the hadeeth 
  which says, then see what you feel most drawn towards). (al-Futoohaat 
  al-Rabaaniyyah, 3/355-357)
Another of the myths that are widespread among people is that 
  after praying istikhaarah you should sleep, and whatever good you see in your 
  dream that makes you happy means that what you want to do is good and will be 
  made easy for you, otherwise it is not good. (This is what the questioner meant 
  by saying gets the message). There is no saheeh daleel (evidence) 
  for this as far as we know.
The above does not mean that if you feel happy it is not a 
  sign, but this should not be regarded as the only sign about whether or not 
  the matter is good. People often make istikhaarah about something they like 
  or want to do, so they feel happy about it from the outset.
Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] (may Allaah have 
  mercy on him) said concerning the matter of feeling happy about something: if 
  he makes istakhaarah, then whatever Allaah makes him feel happy about and makes 
  easy for him, this is what Allaah has chosen for him. (Majmoo 
  al-Fataawaa, 10/539).
There is a difference between making feeling happy the only 
  sign and making it one of several signs. There is no set time period for salaat 
  al-istikhaarah; it is permissible to repeat it more than once, but there is 
  no limit to how many times. The person may offer the duaa before 
  or after saying the salaam. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
5893,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5893,Sponsoring a lost child,"Is it possible to sponsor a child whose
    father is missing under a program for sponsoring orphans, or should this sponsorship
    program be only for orphans?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The orphan is a child whose father has died, as was
    stated by the scholars in Lisaan al-‘Arab [an Arabic-language dictionary] and
    elsewhere. Such a child is regarded as an orphan until he reaches the age of puberty,
    i.e., the age of fifteen or earlier if the signs of puberty appear. These signs are: the
    emission of gushing water (ejaculation) during intercourse or a wet-dream, the growth of
    coarse hair around the private parts, and, in the case of females, the onset of
    menstruation. (See Al-Mughni by Ibn Qudaamah, 6/591)
    As for the child whose father is missing, he is not
    considered to be an orphan unless it is proven that his father is dead, or a period of
    time passes beyond which it is impossible that his father would still be alive; this
    should be left to the discretion of the judge, as stated by the majority of the fuqaha’
    on the topic of the inheritance of one who is missing.
If this child is poor or comes from a poor family, then money can be
    spent on him from the Zakaah or general charity funds, but orphan sponsorship does not
    apply in his case.","Reference: Masaa’il wa Rasaa’il, Muhammad Al-Hammood Al-Najdi, p. 13"
