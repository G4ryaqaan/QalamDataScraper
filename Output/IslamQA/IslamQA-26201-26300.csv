26201,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26201,It is better for workers to hasten to pray when they hear the adhaan,"Is it better for workers to hasten to pray when they hear the adhaan, or to wait until they have finished some tasks? What is the ruling on offering naafil prayers after praying, apart from the regular Sunnah prayers?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It is better for all Muslims to hasten to pray when they hear 
    the adhaan, because the muezzin says, “Hayya ‘ala al-salaah (Come to 
    prayer).” Hesitating will lead to missing the prayer. 
With regard to a worker 
    offering naafil prayers after the prayer, apart from the regular Sunnah 
    prayers, this is not permissible, because his time belongs to someone else, 
    according to the work contract. With regard to the regular Sunnah prayers, 
    there is nothing wrong with him offering them, because bosses and 
    supervisors customarily allow that.

26202,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26202,It is not correct to draw an analogy between donating blood and breastfeeding to prove that someone is a mahram,"I know that breastfeeding establishes the relationship of being a mahram, and that if a woman breastfeeds a child she becomes his mother through breastfeeding (radaa’ah). Is it correct to draw an analogy between blood transfusion and breastfeeding?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This analogy is not 
    correct. The relationship of mahram that is proven in sharee’ah applies only 
    in the case of breastfeeding. This has been stated by the consensus of the 
    Fiqh Council. 

    Majallat al-Buhooth al-Islamiyyah, 
    35/343. 

    The Standing Committee was asked: 

    A man had blood taken from him to be given to his wife. Does 
    that have any effect on his married life with her? 

    They replied: 

    Perhaps the questioner is thinking of an analogy between 
    blood and the milk that establishes the relationship of a mahram. This 
    analogy is not valid for two reasons: 

    1-Blood is not a source of 
    nourishment as milk is;

    2-That which establishes the 
    relationship of a mahram according to the text is breastfeeding that fulfils 
    two conditions: (i) that the breastfeeding occurs five or more times; (ii) 
    that that takes place within the first two years of the child’s life. 
    

    Based on this, the blood that has been taken from you and 
    given to your wife does not have any affect on your married life. And Allaah is the Source of strength.

Many years have passed, and I want to make up the days that I owe, but I do not remember the number of days that I owe. What should I do?",,,"Praise be to Allah.and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allaah.
 You have to do three things:
 1 – Repent to Allaah for this delay, and regret the negligence that has happened in the past, and resolve not to do such a thing again. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And all of you beg Allaah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful”
[al-Noor 24:31]
 This delay is a sin, and repentance to Allaah from that sin is obligatory.
2 – Hasten to fast the number of days that you think most likely, and Allaah does not burden any person beyond his scope. However many days you think you missed, that is the number you should make up. So if you think it was ten days, then fast ten days. If you think it was more or less than that, than fast as many as you think, because Allaah says:
“Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope”
[al-Baqarah 2:286]
“So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can”
[al-Taghaabun 64:16]
 3 – Feed one poor person for each day if you are able to do that. Pay all of that even if it is to one poor person. If you are poor and unable to feed another, then you do not have to do anything except fast and repent. For each day you must give half a saa’ of the staple food of your country, which is equivalent to one and a half kilograms for those who are able to give it.

I live in the U.S. I have known a particular girl for over 6 years now, and she is a HINDU. She and I want to marry, and she wants to learn more about Islam and convert after her knowledge and faith are stronger. Her family was hesitant at first, but is ok with it if this is what she wants. My family on the other hand has reservations about it. They are telling me that she MUST change her name to a Muslim name. Also, since she is the only child of her parents, she still wants to have, in addition to the Muslim ceremony, a Hindu ceremony so that her parents can have what they have always wanted. She has agreed with me to take out parts from the Hindu ceremony that are at all RELIGIOUS, and just do the traditional/cultural parts of it. I feel ok with this, but my parents are making a BIG deal about this. she is willing to learn and accept Islam, and she is just getting upset and frustrated that my parents are making this so difficult, and not being flexible or understanding to her situation. What are your thoughts? Please advise.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We appreciate your confidence in us, and we 
    ask Allaah to make us as you think we are.  
Firstly: 
Please note, may Allaah guide you, that it is 
    not permissible for a Muslim man to marry a non-Muslim woman, unless she is of the people of the Book (Jewish or Christian). 
See question no.
    8015. 
If she becomes Muslim, there is nothing wrong 
    with you marrying her in that case. 
Secondly: 
Try to make sure that your marriage has the 
    approval of your parents, because the approval of your parents will have a good effect on your married life, and this is part of the honouring of 
    parents for which a man will be rewarded. 
Thirdly: 
With regard to changing the name, Shaykh 
    Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
It is not essential to change the name unless it is a name that is not permitted in sharee’ah, such as names which 
    indicate servitude and submission to something other than Allaah and the like, which must be changed. Similarly if it is a name that is used 
    exclusively by the kuffaar and no one else, then it must be changed lest one resemble the kuffaar thereby and lest one feel an attachment to this 
    name which is exclusively for the kuffaar or be accused of not having become Muslim yet. 
See al-Ijaabaat ‘ala As’ilah al-Jaaliyaat, 
    pp. 4-5. 
In the future her changing her name will 
    please your parents, so there is nothing wrong with your convincing her to change it to please your parents.

    will help you to choose that which is best for you in this world and in the hereafter. You can learn how to pray istikhaarah in question no.

26221,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26221,He said that his wife would be haraam to him if he took a second wife and now he wants to marry again,"1 – What is the ruling on a man who follows the Maaliki madhhab if he said that his wife would be haraam to him if he took a second wife, meaning to close the door to a second marriage more than to divorce his wife if he took a second wife? 

2 – What is the ruling on a man who swears that he will divorce his wife if he commits zina (dultery), then he commits zina? 

3 – If the divorce (talaaq) is valid in either case, is there any solution to enable him to keep his wife? Please note that his wife does not live with him in the same city, and he does not want to divorce her, but he wants a way out that will allow him to marry another wife so that he will not fall into zina (adultery) again and commit sin and his wife become forbidden for him.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    Divorce has not taken place in this case, but he must offer 
    kafaarat yameen (expiation for breaking a vow) if he takes a second wife, 
    because by swearing that oath he meant to stop himself (from marrying 
    another woman), not to divorce his wife. 

    Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, Fataawa Manaar al-Islam, 2/584. 
The questioner’s words, 
    “meaning to close the door to a second marriage more than to divorce his 
    wife if he took a second wife” appear to mean divorce and stopping himself 
    at the same time, but the idea of stopping himself is stronger. The ruling 
    does not change because the emphasis is more on stopping himself. 

    Shaykh Khaalid al-Mushayqih  

    Secondly: 
If what he intended when 
    he swore the oath was divorce, then divorce has taken place. If he committed 
    that sin, the divorce has indeed taken place. But if what he intended was to 
    stop himself comitting this sin – which is usually the case when such words 
    are spoken – then he must offer kafaarat al-yameen. 

    Fataawa al-Talaaq by Shaykh Ibn 
    Baaz, 1/141 

    The Muslim should not play about with the word of divorce (talaaq), 
    and swear to divorce his wife as a means of preventing himself from doing 
    something, because many of the scholars think that divorce actually takes 
    place in such cases, even if he did not intend that it should take place. 

    Thirdly: 
Our advice to the 
    questioner is that he should repent sincerely from the zina to which he has 
    confessed, for this is one of the most repugnant of sins, which generates 
    darkness in the heart and on the face of the one who does it. He must strive 
    to follow the means that will prevent him from committing this sin. The 
    scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) have stated that marriage is 
    obligatory if a man fears that he may fall into sin if he does not marry. 

    Al-Mughni, 9/341 

    So you must strive to bring your wife to live with you in the 
    same city, because this is a way of treating her in a kind manner. You 
    should realize that she is suffering just as you are. You should not be 
    concerned about protecting yourself from falling into sin, then leave your 
    wife to suffer, for that is contrary to the kind treatment enjoined by 
    Allaah and His Messenger. If you cannot manage to do that, then you should 
    take a second wife, but that does not mean that your first wife will be 
    divorced, as stated above; rather you will have to offer kafaarat yameen. 

    Kafaarat yameen is mentioned in the aayah (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 

    “Allaah will not punish you for what is unintentional in 
    your oaths, but He will punish you for your deliberate oaths; for its 
    expiation (a deliberate oath) feed ten Masaakeen (poor persons), on a scale 
    of the average of that with which you feed your own families, or clothe them 
    or manumit a slave. But whosoever cannot afford (that), then he should fast 
    for three days. That is the expiation for the oaths when you have sworn”

What does Islam say about this, or does it not exist at all?","There is something which is called the qarin, which Allah has caused to accompany every human being. This qarin pushes a person to do evil things and to disobey Allah, with the exception of the Prophet, as will be explained in the detailed answer.",,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, there is something which is called the qarin , which Allah has caused to accompany every human being. This qarin pushes a person to do evil things and to disobey Allah, with the exception of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as will be explained below. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“His companion (qarin) will say: ‘Our Lord! I did not push him to transgression, (in disbelief, oppression, and evil deeds), but he was himself in error far astray.’ Allah will say: ‘Dispute not in front of Me, I had already in advance sent you the threat. The Sentence that comes from Me cannot be changed, and I am not unjust  to the slaves.’” [Qaf 50:27-29]
Ibn Kathir said: 
“‘His companion (qarin) will say’ – Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), Mujahid, Qatadah and others said: this refers to the devil who is appointed to accompany him. ‘Our Lord! I did not push him to transgression’ means, he will disown that person on the Day of Judgement, and will say, ‘Our Lord! I did not push him to transgression’ meaning, I did not lead him astray. 
‘but he was himself in error far astray’ means, he was misguided in himself, receptive to falsehood and resistant to the truth – as Allah says elsewhere (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘And Shaytan (Satan) will say when the matter has been decided: “Verily, Allah promised you a promise of truth. And I too promised you, but I betrayed you. I had no authority over you except that I called you, and you responded to me. So blame me not, but blame yourselves. I cannot help you, nor can you help me. I deny your former act in associating me (Satan) as a partner with Allah (by obeying me in the life of the world). Verily, there is a painful torment for the Zalimun (polytheists and wrongdoers).”’ [Ibrahim 14:22]
The phrase ‘Dispute not in front of Me’ refers to what Allah will say to the human and his companion from among the jinn, when they dispute before Him, and the human says, ‘O Lord, this one led me astray from the Reminder after it had come to me’ and the devil will say, ‘Our Lord! I did not push him to transgression, (in disbelief, oppression, and evil deeds), but he was himself in error far astray’ – i.e., from the path of truth. 
Allah will say, ‘Dispute not in front of Me’ meaning, in My presence. ‘I had already in advance sent you the threat’ means, I sent the warning on the lips of the Messengers, and I sent down the Books, so proof and evidence was established against you. 
‘The Sentence that comes from Me cannot be changed’ – Mujahid said, this means I have passed My judgement. 
‘and I am not unjust  to the slaves’ means, I do not punish anyone for the sin of another, and I only punish a person for his sin after proof has been established against him.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 4/227) 
‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no one among you but a companion from among the jinn has been assigned to him.” They said, “Even you, O Messenger of Allah?’ He said, “Even me, but Allah helped me with him and he became Muslim (or: and I am safe from him), so he only enjoins me to do that which is good.” 
According to another report, “… There is assigned to him a companion from among the jinn and a companion from among the angels.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2814)
Al-Nawawi included this in a chapter which he called: Bab Tahrish al-Shaytan wa Ba’thihi Sarayahu li Fitnat il-Nas wa anna ma’a kulli insanin Qarin (Chapter on the evil of the Shaytan and his sending his troops to tempt the people, and the fact that there is a jinn -companion with every human being). 
Al-Nawawi said: 
“Fa aslamu (and I am safe from him) or fa aslama (and he became Muslim). These are two well known versions. One means ‘and I am safe from his evil and his temptation.’ The other means that ‘the qarin became Muslim and became a believer, so he does not tell me to do anything but good’.  
There was some scholarly dispute as to the form of the word. Al-Khattabi said that the word was Fa aslamu (and I am safe from him); al-Qadi ‘Iyad said that it was fa aslama (and he became Muslim), which is more correct, because the hadith says, ‘so he only enjoins me to do that which is good’.  
They also disputed as to the meaning of the word fa aslama.  Some said that it meant that he (the qarin) submitted and surrendered, as it was narrated elsewhere than in Sahih Muslim, fa astaslama [he gave up and surrendered]. It was also suggested that it means that he became a Muslim and a believer. The latter is the apparent meaning. Al-Qadi said: Note that the ummah unanimously agreed that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was protected from the Shaytan physically, mentally and with regard to what he said. This hadith contains a warning against the temptation of the qarin and his whispers and temptations. We know that he is with us so we should beware of him as much as possible.” (Sharh Muslim, 17/157, 158)
‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If anyone of you is praying, he should not let anyone pass in front of him; if that person insists then he should fight him for there is a qarin with him.” (Narrated by Muslim, 506) 
Al-Shawkani said: 
“The phrase ‘for there is a qarin with him’—according to al-Qamus [an Arabic-language dictionary] the word qarin refers to a companion; the Shaytan always accompanies man and never leaves him. This is what is referred to here.” (Nayl al-Awtar, 3/7)

If I stop praying, am I sinning?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If a prayer is naafil (supererogatory), there is more room for manoeuvre, and it is o.k. to stop praying in order to find out who is at the door. But in the case of a fard (obligatory) prayer, it is not permissible to stop it unless there is something important which one is afraid of missing. If it is possible to alert someone else, by saying “Subhan-Allah” out loud in the case of men and clapping in the case of women, so that the person at the door will realize that the person in the house is busy praying, that will do away with any need to stop praying. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever is alarmed by anything whilst praying, let men say ‘Subhan-Allah’ and let women clap.” (Agreed upon. Al-Bukhari, 1234; Muslim, 421). 
If it is possible to let the person who is at the door realize that the person inside the house is praying, by clapping in the case of women and saying ‘Subhan-Allah’ in the case of men, whilst still praying, this will save you from having to stop the prayer. If that will not work, because one is too far away from the door or the person outside will not be able to hear, then it is o.k. to stop the prayer if necessary, especially if it is a naafil prayer.

Should it be based on the price for which they are bought or the price for which they are to be sold?,,,"Praise be to Allah.The way in which the zakah on trade goods is worked out is based on their market value (which is usually the price for which they are sold in the store) after one full year has passed, whether this price is equal to the price paid for them or it is more or less. Then zakah should be paid at the rate of one-quarter of one-tenth (i.e., 2.5%). (Risaalah fi’l_zakah by Shaykh Ibn Baz, p. 11; Risaalah fi’l-zakah al-‘Aqaar by Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd, p. 8). 
This is perfectly just, because its value after one year has passed may differ from the price for which it was bought; it may be more or less. 
If the businessman is one who sells wholesale, then he should base his zakah on the wholesale price, and if he is one who sells retail, then he should base his zakah on the retail price. Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/146. 
If he sells both wholesale and retail, then he should strive to work out the amount of goods he sells wholesale and the amount he sells retail, and pay his zakah accordingly.

Al-Tirmidhi said, this is a sound hadith. It was classed as sahih by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah in Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 22/277, and by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, 3053. 
How often should you recite Surat al-Mulk to get protected from punishment in the grave?
What is meant is that a person should read Surat al-Mulk every night , act in accordance with the rulings contained in it, and believe in the information mentioned in it. 
‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud said: Whoever reads Tabarak alladhi bi yadihi’l-mulk [i.e., Surat al-Mulk ] every night, Allah will protect him from the torment of the grave . At the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) we used to call it al-mani’ah (that which protects). In the Book of Allah it is a surah which, whoever recites it every night has done very well. (Narrated by al-Nasai, 6/179; classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih al-Targhib wa’l-Tarhib, 1475.)
The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 
“On this basis there is the hope that whoever believes in this surah and reads it regularly, seeking the pleasure of Allah, learning the lessons contained in it and acting in accordance with the rulings contained therein, it will intercede for him [in the Hereafter].” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 4/334, 335)

Examples of good deeds 


Hadith about some other good deeds","Praise be to Allah.Meaning of good deeds
Good deeds are those which are in accordance with sharee‘ah, and which are done sincerely for the sake of Allah. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah defined ‘ibadah (worship) as “a general term which includes all that Allah loves and is pleased with, be it words or deeds, both inward and outward; these are of many kinds and we cannot list them, let alone enumerate them, but we will mention some of them.
Examples of good deeds 
1. Belief in Allah – which includes belief in Allah, His angels, His Books, His messengers, the Last Day, and the divine will and decree (al-qadar), both good and bad.
2. Prayer done on time – there are five prayers that Allah has enjoined during the night and day. The Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) all agreed that the one who does not pray is an unbeliever. It is not permissible to delay the prayers beyond their appointed time. It is obligatory to perform all the obligatory parts of the prayer, and the Muslim should pray as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed.
3. Acceptable Hajj – which means:
a. It should be done with halal money (earned from permissible sources)
b. One should avoid immoral actions, sin and arguments whilst doing Hajj
c. He should perform all the rituals according to the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
d. He should not do Hajj to show off, rather he should do it sincerely for the sake of Allah.
e. He should not follow it with any act of disobedience or sin.
4. Honouring one's parents – which means obeying them in acts of obedience towards Allah; it is not permissible to obey them in matters of disobedience or sin. Honouring them also means not raising one's voice to them, and not offending them with hurtful words. It also includes spending on them, and serving them.
5. Jihad for the sake of Allah. Allah has prescribed jihad in order to establish Tawhid and spread Islam throughout the world. Allah has prepared a great reward for the mujahidin.
6. Loving for the sake of Allah and hating for the sake of Allah. This means that the Muslim loves his fellow Muslim for the sake of Allah, not for his colour, nationality or wealth, rather for his obedience to his Lord and his closeness to Him. Similarly he hates the sinner for his disobedience towards Allah.
7. Reading and reciting Quran – whether that is in the portion he reads each day or what he recites in prayers at night (qiyam al-layl).
8. Persisting in acts of worship even if they are little. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) loved actions that were done consistently, even if they were little. A small action done persistently is better than a greater action done intermittently.
9. Fulfilling one's trusts. This is an obligatory action and is one of the greatest of deeds. It is known in Islam that the hypocrite is the one who betrays his trust and does not render trusts back to the people who entrusted them to him.
10. Being forgiving towards people. This means foregoing one's personal rights, forgiving the one who has done you wrong, if doing so will lead to his changing, or if he has repented and regrets what he did. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A person only increases in honour by forgiving.” Narrated by Muslim, 2588
11. Being truthful in speech. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A man will keep on speaking the truth and endeavouring to tell the truth until he will be recorded with Allah as a speaker of truth. Truthfulness is a means of salvation; it is a great characteristic which was one of the features of the prophets and those who followed them in truth.” Narrated by Muslim, 2607.
12. Spending for the sake of Allah. This includes spending on jihad, and spending on one's parents, the poor and needy, on building mosques, on printing copies of the Quran and Islamic books, and spending on one’s family and children.
13. Ensuring that the Muslims are safe from one’s words and actions. That means refraining from gossip, backbiting, slander, insults and curses, and refraining from hitting or beating those who do not deserve such treatment.
14. Feeding the hungry – which includes feeding both humans and animals.
15. Spreading the greeting of salam to those whom you know and those whom you do not know – except in the case of those whom the texts say we should not initiate the greeting of salam with, namely the kuffar.
16. Helping the needy, wayfarers and those who are helpless.
17. Keeping your evil away from people, which is an act of charity that may benefit you.
And there are many other good deeds. 
Hadith about some other good deeds
The following hadith enumerates several good deeds: 
Al-Bayhaqi narrated that Abu Dharr said: I said, “O Messenger of Allah, what will save a person from Hellfire?”
 He said, “Belief in Allah.” 
I said, “O Messenger of Allah, are there any deeds that should accompany that belief?” 
He said, ``He should give from that provision which Allah has granted him.” 
I said, “O Messenger of Allah, what if he is poor and does not have anything to give?” 
He said, “He should enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil.” 
I said, “O Messenger of Allah, what if he cannot enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil?” 
He said, “He should help the one who is helpless (i.e., has no skills and cannot earn a learning).” 
I said, “What if he himself is helpless and cannot do anything?” 
He said, “He should help one who has been wronged.” 
I said, “What if he is weak and cannot help one who has been wronged?”  
He said, “You do not want to think of your companion as having any good in him. Let him refrain from harming people.” 
I said, “O Messenger of Allah, if he does that, will he enter Paradise?” 
He said, “There is no believer who does not strive to acquire one of these characteristics, but I will take him by the hand and lead him into Paradise.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Targhib, 876)

If the husband does not want to divorce the wife, can the divorce still happen? What about in societies like America, where women don’t like their husbands (in some cases, because the husbands are religious). The women think that they have the freedom that if they don’t like the men, they can divorce them.","1- Khul’ means the separation of the wife in return for a payment; the husband takes the payment and lets his wife go.
2- The husband should take his payment or they should agree upon it, then he should say to her “faraqtuki” (I separate from you) or “khala’tuki (I let you go), or other such words.","What is khul’?


Khul’ in the Quran


Khul’ in the Sunnah


How is khul’ done?


Valid reasons for divorce","Praise be to Allah.What is khul’?
Khul’ means the separation of the wife in return for a payment; the husband takes the payment and lets his wife go, whether this payment is the mahr which he gave to her, or more or less than that. 
Khul’ in the Quran
The basic principle concerning this is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And it is not lawful for you (men) to take back (from your wives) any of your Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) which you have given them, except when both parties fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by Allah (e.g. to deal with each other on a fair basis). Then if you fear that they would not be able to keep the limits ordained by Allah, then there is no sin on either of them if she gives back (the Mahr or a part of it) for her Khul (annulment).” [al-Baqarah 2:229]
Khul’ in the Sunnah
The evidence for that from the Sunnah is that the wife of Thabit ibn Qays ibn Shammaas (may Allah be pleased with him) came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of Allah, I do not find any fault with Thabit ibn Qays in his character or his religious commitment, but I do not want to commit any act of kufr after becoming a Muslim.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to her, “Will you give back his garden?” Because he had given her a garden as her mahr. She said, “Yes.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Thabit: “Take back your garden, and divorce her.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5273). 
From this case the scholars understood that if a woman cannot stay with her husband, then the judge should ask him to divorce her by khul’; indeed he should order him to do so. 
How is khul’ done?
With regard to the way in which it is done, the husband should take his payment or they should agree upon it, then he should say to her “faraqtuki” (I separate from you) or “khala’tuki (I let you go), or other such words. 
Talaq (i.e., divorce) is the right of the husband, and does not take place unless it is done by him, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Talaq is the right of the one who seizes the leg (i.e., consummates the marriage)” i.e., the husband. (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 2081; classed as hasan by al-Albani in Irwa al-Ghalil, 2041). 
Hence the scholars said that whoever is forced to divorce his wife by talaq wrongfully, and divorces her under pressure, then his divorce is not valid. (Al-Mughni, 10/352)
Valid reasons for divorce
With regard to what you mention, that a woman in your country might arrange her own divorce through the man-made laws, if this is for a reason for which it is permissible to seek a divorce, such as disliking her husband, not being able to stay with him or disliking him because of his immoral ways and indulgence in  haram actions, etc., there is nothing wrong with her seeking divorce, but in this case she should divorce him by khul’ and return to him the mahr that he gave to her. 
But if she is seeking divorce for no reason , then that is not permissible and the court ruling on divorce in this case does not count for anything in terms of shari’ah. The woman still remains the wife of the man. This gives rise to a new problem, which is that this woman is regarded as a divorcee in the eyes of the (man-made) law, and can remarry after her ‘iddah ends, but in fact she is still a wife and not a divorcee. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a similar matter and said: 
“Now we have a problem. The fact that she is still married to him means that she cannot marry anyone else, but according to the court ruling she is apparently divorced from him, and when her ‘iddah ends she can remarry. I think that the only way out of this problem is that good and righteous people should get involved in this matter, to bring about reconciliation between the man and his wife. Otherwise she has to give him some payment, so that it will be a proper shar’i khul’.” (Liqa’ al-bab al-Maftuh by Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin, no. 54; 3/174)

    See Question no.
    10439. 

    With regard to a woman riding with a non-mahram man, one of 
    the following two scenarios must apply. 

    1 – That she is riding on her own with him. This is the 
    khulwah (being alone with a member of the opposite sex) which is forbidden. 
    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade it when 
    he said: “No man is alone with a (non-mahram) woman but the Shaytaan is the 
    third one present.” (Narrated by Ahmad and al-Tirmidhi in his Sunan, 
    2092; also in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 2546). See also question no,
    2986. 

    2 – That she is riding with a group of women and that 
    non-mahram man. This is permitted, subject to two conditions:

    (i)That the man should be 
    trustworthy

    (ii)That it should not be a 
    journey, rather it should be inside the city. But if that is a lengthy 
    journey then it is haraam for her to travel without a mahram, because the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “It is not 
    permissible for a Muslim woman to travel the distance of one night’s travel 
    without a man who is her mahram.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1088; Muslim, 
    1339. This version narrated by Muslim).

    Based on that, it is permissible for a woman to ride with her 
    sister’s husband if they are accompanied by her sister, and it is 
    permissible for her to ride with her husband’s brother if they are 
    accompanied by his mother, if there is no danger of fitnah.",Islam Q&A
26259,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26259,Types of intercession (shafaa’ah),"I hear some people saying that intercession belongs only to Allah and can only be asked of Him, while others say that Allah has given the power of intercession to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and to His righteous close friends (awliyaa’) so that we may ask them to intercede for us. What is the correct view, and can you quote shar’i evidence to support it?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Intercession means mediating for someone else to gain some benefit or ward off some harm. 
It is of two types: 
The first type: intercession that will take place in the Hereafter, on the Day of Resurrection. 
The second type: intercession concerning matters of this world. 
With regard to the intercession that will take place in the Hereafter, it is of two types: 
The first type: exclusive intercession, which will be granted only to the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and no one else in creation will have a share in that with him. This is of various kinds: 
1 – The greater intercession. This is the station of praise and glory (al-maqaam al-mahmood) which Allah has promised to him, when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And in some parts of the night (also) offer the Salaat (prayer) with it (i.e. recite the Qur’aan in the prayer) as an additional prayer (Tahajjud optional prayer Nawaafil) for you (O Muhammad). It may be that your Lord will raise you to Maqaam Mahmood (a station of praise and glory, i.e., the honour of intercession on the Day of Resurrection)”
[al-Isra’ 17:79]
What this intercession means is that he will intercede for all of mankind when Allah delays the Reckoning and they have waited for so long in the place of gathering on the Day of Resurrection. Their distress and anxiety will reach a point where they can no longer bear it, and they will say, “Who will intercede for us with our Lord so that He will pass judgement amongst His slaves?” and they will wish to leave that place. So the people will come to the Prophets, each of whom will say, “I am not able for it,” until when they come to our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), he will say, “I am able for it, I am able for it.” So he will intercede for them, that judgement may be passed. This is the greater intercession, and it is one of the things that belong exclusively to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
There are many ahaadeeth which speak of this intercession, in al-Saheehayn and elsewhere, such as the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh (1748) from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him): “The people will fall on their knees on the Day of Resurrection, each nation following its Prophet, saying, ‘O So and so, intercede!’ until intercession is granted to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). On that Day Allah will resurrect him to a station of praise and glory.” 
2 – Intercession for the people of Paradise to enter Paradise. 
It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘I will come to the gate of Paradise on the Day of Resurrection and will ask for it to be opened. The gatekeeper will say, “Who are you?” I will say, “Muhammad.” He will say, “I was commanded not to open it for anyone before you.”’” (Narrated by Muslim, 333). 
According to another report narrated by Muslim (332), “I will be the first one to intercede concerning Paradise.” 
3 – The intercession of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for his uncle Abu Taalib: 
It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that mention was made of his uncle Abu Taalib in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He said, “Perhaps my intercession will benefit him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will be placed in a shallow part of the Fire which will come up to his ankles and cause his brains to boil.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1408; Muslim, 360). 
4 – His intercession so that some people of his ummah will enter Paradise without being brought to account. 
This kind of intercession was mentioned by some of the scholars, who quoted as evidence the lengthy hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah concerning intercession, in which it says: “Then it will be said, ‘O Muhammad, raise you head; ask, it will be given to you; intercede, your intercession will be accepted.’ So I will raise my head and say, ‘My ummah, O Lord; my ummah, O Lord; my ummah, O Lord.’ It will be said, ‘Admit those among your ummah who are  not to be brought to account through the right-hand gate of Paradise. They will share the other gates with the people of other nations.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4343; Muslim, 287). 
The second type: general intercession. This will be granted to the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and others – angels, Prophets and righteous people – will share in it as Allah wills. This is of various kinds: 
1 – Intercession for some people who have entered Hell, that they might be brought forth from it. There is a great deal of evidence for this, for example: 
The marfoo’ hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) in Saheeh Muslim (269): “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, none of you can be more insistent in asking Allah to restore his rights against his opponent than the believers who will ask Allah, on the Day of Resurrection, (to grant them the power of intercession) for their brothers who are in the Fire. They will say, ‘Our Lord, they used to fast with us and pray and perform Hajj.’ It will be said to them, ‘Bring out those whom you recognize, so the Fire will be forbidden to burn them.’ So they will bring out many people… And Allah will say: ‘The angels have interceded, and the Prophets have interceded, and the believers have interceded. There is none left but the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.’ Then He will seize a handful of the Fire and bring forth from it people who never did anything good.” 
2 – Intercession for people who deserve Hell, that they may not enter it. This may be indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “There is no Muslim who dies and forty men who associate nothing with Allah pray the funeral prayer for him, but Allah will accept their intercession for him.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1577). For this intercession happens before the deceased enters Hell, and Allah will accept their intercession concerning that. 
3 – Intercession for some of the believers who deserve Paradise, that they may be raised in status in Paradise. For example, Muslim (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated (1528) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed for Abu Salamah and said: “O Allah, forgive Abu Salamah and raise his status among those who are guided, and take good care of his family that he has left behind. Forgive us and him, O Lord of the Worlds, make his grave spacious for him and illuminate it for him.” 
Conditions of this intercession:
The evidence indicates that intercession in the Hereafter will only happen if the following conditions are met: 
1)Allah must approve of the one for whom intercession is made, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“and they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased”
[al-Anbiya’ 21:28]
This implies that the one for whom intercession is made must be a believer in Tawheed, because Allah is not pleased with the mushrikeen. In Saheeh al-Bukhaari (97) it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: “It was said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, who will be the most blessed of people by your intercession of the Day of Resurrection?’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I thought, O Abu Hurayrah, that no one would ask me about this hadeeth before you, because I have seen how keen you are to learn hadeeth. The people who will be most blessed by my intercession on the Day of Resurrection are those who say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah sincerely from the heart.’” 
2)Allah must give permission to the intercessor to intercede, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His Permission?”[al-Baqarah 2:255]
3)Allah must approve of the intercessor, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“…whose intercession will avail nothing except after Allah has given leave for whom He wills and is pleased with”
[al-Najm 53:26]
And the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has stated that those who curse much will not be intercessors on the Day of Resurrection, as Muslim narrated in his Saheeh (4703) that Abu’l-Darda’ (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, ‘Those who curse much will not be witnesses or intercessors on the Day of Resurrection.’” 
The second type of intercession is that which has to do with matters of this world. This is of two types: 
1 – That which is within a person’s ability to do something. This is permissible, subject to two conditions: 
1)That it should have to do with a permissible thing. It is not correct to intercede concerning something that will result in the loss of people’s rights or in wrong being done to them. It is also not correct to intercede concerning something that is haraam, such as those who intercede concerning those who deserve the hadd punishment, asking that it not be carried out on them. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
 
“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression”
[al-Maa’idah 5:2]         
          According to a hadeeth narrated by ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), Quraysh were concerned about a Makhzoomi woman who had stolen, and they said, “Who will speak to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning her? Who better than Usaamah, the beloved of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)?” So Usaamah spoke to him, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Are you interceding concerning one of the hadd punishments prescribed by Allah?” Then he stood up and addressed the people, and said, “O people, those who came before you were only destroyed because if one of their nobles stole they would let him off but if one of the weak stole they would carry out the punishment on him. By Allah, if Faatimah the daughter of Muhammad were to steal, I would cut off her hand.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3261; Muslim, 3196). 
In Saheeh al-Bukhaari (5568) and Saheeh Muslim (4761) it is narrated that Abu Moosa (may Allah be pleased with him) said that if someone came with a need to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), he would turn to those who were sitting with him and say, “Intercede, and you will be rewarded, and Allah will decree what He wills through the lips of His Messenger.”  
2)In his heart, the person must depend on Allah alone to realize his aim and ward off what is disliked. He should know that this intercessor is no more than a means which Allah has permitted to us, and that benefit and harm are in the hand of Allah alone. This meaning is expressed clearly in the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
If either of these two conditions is not met, then the intercession is not allowed. 
2 – That which is not within a person’s ability to do something, such as seeking intercession from the dead and occupants of graves, or from a living person who is absent, believing that he is able to hear and meet one’s need. This is the kind of intercession that constitutes shirk, which is clearly forbidden in many verses of the Qur’aan and ahaadeeth from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), because it ascribes to them attributes which belong only to the Creator, for He is the Ever-living Who never dies. 
Their specious argument is that the awliya’ (“saints”) and Sayyids intercede for their relatives and for those who call on them and take them as friends and love them, and because of that they ask them for intercession. This is exactly what Allah described the early mushrikeen as doing, when they said, 
“These are our intercessors with Allah”
[Yoonus 10:18 – interpretation of the meaning]
–referring to those whom they worshipped among the angels, righteous people and others, and meaning that they would intercede for them with Allah. In the same way, the contemporary mushrikoon say “the awliya’ (‘saints’) intercede for us; we cannot ask of Allah (directly) so we ask them and they ask of Allah.” And they say that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and all the Prophets and righteous people were given the power of intercession, and we call upon them and say, intercede for us as Allah has given you the power of intercession. They give the example of kings in this world, and say that the kings of this world can only be approached through intercession; if you need something, you go to their friends and those who are close to them, their ministers, gatekeepers, servants, etc., to intercede for you so that the king can deal with your matter; so we reach Allah by approaching and asking His awliyaa’ and the Sayyids who are close to Him. By doing this they fall into the same shirk as those who came before them, and they compare the Creator to His creation.
Allah tells us of a righteous man in Soorat Ya-Seen, who said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“ ‘Shall I take besides Him aalihah (gods)? If the Most Gracious (Allah) intends me any harm, their intercession will be of no use for me whatsoever”
[Ya-Seen 36:23]
And Allah tells us that the kuffaar will confess it themselves: 
“They will say: ‘We were not of those who used to offer the Salaah (prayers),
Nor we used to feed Al-Miskeen (the poor);
And we used to talk falsehood (all that which Allah hated) with vain talkers.
And we used to belie the Day of Recompense,
Until there came to us (the death) that is certain’
So no intercession of intercessors will be of any use to them”
[al-Muddaththir 74:43-48 – interpretation of the meaning]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), even though he will be given the power of intercession on the Day of Resurrection, will not be able to use it until after Allah has given him permission and has approved of the one for whom intercession is to be made. 
Hence he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not let his ummah ask him to intercede for them in this world, and that was not narrated from any one of his Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them). If that had been a good thing, he would have conveyed it to his ummah and called them to do it, and his Companions who were keen to do good would have hastened to do it. Thus we know that seeking intercession from him now (in this world) is a great wrong, because it involves calling upon someone other than Allah and doing something which is an obstacle to intercession, for intercession is available only to those who sincerely believe in Allah alone (Tawheed) 
The people in the place of standing (on the Day of Resurrection) will only ask the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to intercede for them so that judgement will be passed, because he will be there with them and because he will be able to turn to his Lord and ask Him. This is like asking a person who is alive and present to do make du’aa’ for one, which is something that he is able to do. 
Hence it is not narrated that any of the people in the place of standing will ask him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to intercede for them that their sins might be forgiven. 
Those who ask him for intercession now, based on the fact that it will be permissible to ask him for that in the Hereafter, if their claims were justified, would have to limit what they say to, “O Messenger of Allah, intercede for us that judgement may be passed”! But they do something other than that. They do not limit it to a request for intercession, rather they ask the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – and others – to relieve their distress and send down mercy; they turn to him at times of calamity; they pray to him on land and sea, at times of ease and times of difficulty, ignoring the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Is not He (better than your gods) Who responds to the distressed one, when he calls on Him, and Who removes the evil, and makes you inheritors of the earth, generations after generations?”
[al-Naml 27:62]
From the above it is clear to every fair-minded person that the correct kind of intercession is intercession that depends on the permission and approval of Allah, because all intercession belongs to Him. That also includes asking for intercession from living people who are able to do that concerning worldly matters, for which Allah has granted permission. It should be pointed out here that this kind of intercession is permitted because Allah has given permission for it, since it involves no kind of emotional attachment to the person, rather the point is that it is a means, like all other means which Islam permits us to use. The kind of intercession which is forbidden is asking someone other than Allah to do something that no one is able to do except Allah, because intercession belongs to no one besides Allah, and no one can do it unless Allah grants him leave and approves of him. So whoever seeks intercession from anyone else has transgressed upon the exclusive preserve of Allah and has wronged himself, and has exposed himself to being deprived of the intercession of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on the Day of Resurrection. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound, and we ask Him to cause our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to intercede for us … Ameen.

Meaning : can he have sex with one wife and have the second wife join, even if they can't see each other?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Having intercourse with one wife in the 
    presence of the other and where she can see is something concerning which there should be no dispute that it is haraam. 
1 – al-Hasan al-Basri said: They – meaning 
    the Sahaabah and senior Taabi’een – used to regard wajs as makrooh, which means having intercourse with one when the other can hear the 
    sounds. The word “makrooh” according to the earlier scholars means that it is haraam. 
Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf, 
    4/388 
2 – Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on 
    him) said: If two wives agree to live together in one house, that is permissible, because they each have the right to their own house, but they 
    may give up that right. Similarly they may agree to let him sleep between them in one bed. But if they agree to let him have intercourse with one 
    of them when the other one is looking, that is not permissible, because it is vile and despicable and is not appropriate, and it does not become 
    permissible even if they agree to it. 
al-Mughni, 
    8/137 
3 – al-Hajaawi the author of Zaad al-Mustanqi’ 
    said: It is makrooh to have intercourse where anyone can see. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen commented on these 
    words by saying: 
It is very strange that he limited himself to 
    describing it as makrooh. This covers two issues. The first is having intercourse where the awrahs of both partners can be seen. Undoubtedly 
    limiting oneself to saying that this is makrooh is a mistake, because it is obligatory to cover the ‘awrah. If it is in a place where anyone can 
    see their ‘awrahs, this is undoubtedly haraam, and what this author says is not correct at all. 
The second is having intercourse in a place 
    where the ‘awrah cannot be seen. Limiting oneself to saying that this is makrooh is also subject to further discussion. For example, if they are 
    covered with a blanket and he starts to have intercourse with her, and the movements can be seen. This is undoubtedly more likely to be haraam, 
    because it is not appropriate for a Muslim to lower himself to such a level. 

    This may also provoke desire in the person who sees this, and that may lead to evil consequences. 
The correct view concerning this matter is 
    that it is haraam to have intercourse with a woman in view of anyone, unless the onlooker is a child who does not understand what is happening; in 
    this case it does not matter. But if the child understands what is happening then intercourse should not take place where he can see, even if he 
    is a child, because a child may speak about what he has seen unintentionally.

    That depends. It is preferable to delay the prayer until the

My question is, who was Abu Mihjan and what was his story?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.I congratulate you on your keenness to learn 
    and I ask Allaah to bless us and you with beneficial knowledge and righteous deeds. 
Abu Mihjan was one of the companions of the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (may Allaah be pleased with them). 
This Sahaabi was suffering from an addiction 
    to drinking wine. He was brought and flogged, then brought and flogged again, but he knew that this problem did not relieve him of his duty to 
    strive for the cause of Islam. So he went out with the Muslims to al-Qaadisiyyah as a soldier, seeking martyrdom on the battlefield. In 
    al-Qaadisiyyah he was brought to the commander of the army, Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqaas, for having drunk wine. Sa’d detained him so that the Muslims 
    ranks would be cleansed of such a person.  
This detention was a harsh punishment which 
    caused Abu Mihjan a great deal of anguish. When he heard the sounds of swords and spears, and the neighing of the horses, and he knew that the 
    jihad had begun, and the gates of Paradise were open, he was filled with longing for jihad.  He called to the wife of Sa’d ibn Abi Waaqqas saying, 
    “Let me go and I promise Allaah that if I come back safe and sound, I will put my own feet in the chains, and if I am killed, then you will be rid 
    of me.” She felt sorry for him, so she let him go, and he leapt onto a horse belonging to Sa’d which was called al-Balqa’. Then he picked up a 
    spear and set off. He did not attack any group of enemy soldier but he scattered them. Sa’d was supervising the battle and he was surprised and 
    said, “This is the running of al-Balqa’, and the style of attack is that of Abu Mihjan, but Abu Mihjan is in chains.”  
When the battle was over, Abu Mihjan went 
    back and put his feet in the chains. The wife of Sa’d told him this wonderful story, so Sa’d admired this man and his care for Islam and his 
    longing for jihad, so he himself went to this wine-drinker, released the chains with his own hands and said, “Get up, for by Allaah I will never 
    flog you for drinking wine again.” Abu Mihjan said, “By Allaah, I will never drink it again.”

    It was not narrated from the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) or from any of his companions, as far as we 
    know, that they used to raise their hands and say du’aa’ after praying an 
    obligatory prayer. Hence we know that this is a bid’ah (innovation), because 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever 
    does anything that is not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam) 
    will have it rejected.” (narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh, 3243). And 
    he said: “Whoever innovates anything in this matter of ours (Islam) that is 
    not part of it will have it rejected.” (Saheeh – agreed upon). 

    However, reciting du’aa’ without raising one’s hands and 
    without reciting it in unison is fine, because 
    evidence to that effect was reported from the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), indicating that he made du’aa’ both before 
    and after prayer. The same applies to making du’aa’ after praying naafil 
    prayers, because there is no evidence to indicate that this should not be 
    done, even if one raises one’s hands, because raising the hands is one of 
    the means of having one’s du’aa’ answered. But that should not be done all 
    the time, rather only sometimes, because it was not reported that the

What should I do in this situation?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If you lose your Wudu when praying and you are certain because there is a sound or a smell, then you have to repeat your Wudu and your prayer, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If any one of you breaks wind during prayer, let him stop and do Wudu, then repeat the prayer.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 205; al-Tirnidhi, 1164, with a hasan isnaad). And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The prayer of any one of you will not be accepted if he breaks wind, until he has done Wudu.” (Agreed upon; al-Bukhari, 135; Muslim, 225) 
But if this happens to you constantly, then you have to do Wudu for prayer when the time for prayer begins, then pray fard and naafil – before the time for that prayer ends  – and it does not matter if you pass wind during that time, because this is the matter of necessity and the one who is continually breaking his Wudu is excused and does not have to do Wudu until the time for the next prayer begins.

    servants and the bad consequences of bringing them from abroad and letting stay in Muslim homes. Hence the Muslim should not resort to bringing 
    servants to live in the home, especially if there are adolescent boys in the house. If the servants are not Muslim, then it is even more definite 
    that they should not be brought into the home. The regrettable consequences of such actions are greater than can be enumerated. 
The one who brings in a servant also commits 
    other haraam actions, such as bringing her from her country without a mahram; causing her to be alone with non-mahram men in rooms and houses; and 
    looking at her and vice versa. 
Hence our scholars have warned against 
    employing servants except in cases of necessity. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn ‘Uthaymeen 
    said: 
Firstly: 
We should not employ female or male servants 
    except in cases of necessity. That is because bringing these servants involves spending money that a person does not need to spend. It was proven 
    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade wasting money. 
Secondly: 
Some of them are not honest enough to deserve 
    the trust we place in them, hence I say that we should not bring male or female servants from abroad unless the following conditions are met: 
With regard to women: 
Firstly: 
The female servant should have a mahram with 
    her, because it is not permissible to bring her to the country otherwise. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “No 
    woman should travel without a mahram.” If a woman is brought in and has no mahram with her, this is going against the prohibition of the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
Secondly: 
There should be a need for her services. If 
    there is no need and the only reason for bringing her here is to live a life of luxury and have no obligations, or to make life easy for his wife 
    even though the housework is not much, then the issue is subject to further discussion. 
The third condition: 
There should be no fear of fitnah 
    (temptation). If a man fears that he or one of his sons – if he has sons – may be subject to temptation, then it is not permissible for him to 
    expose himself to that. 
The fourth condition: 
She should adhere to what is required of her 
    of hijab, so she should cover her face and not uncover it. It is not correct to quote as evidence the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and 
    protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent (like both eyes for 
    necessity to see the way, or outer palms of hands or one eye or dress like veil, gloves, headcover, apron), and to draw their veils all over 
    Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms) and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their 
    husband’s fathers, or their sons, or their husband’s sons, or their brothers or their brother’s sons, or their sister’s sons, or their (Muslim) 
    women (i.e. their sisters in Islam), or the (female) slaves whom their right hands possess”
    [al-Noor 24:31] 
and it is not correct to interpret that as 
    meaning that it is permissible for a female servant to uncover her face in front of her male employer, because the one who hires a servant does 
    not own her (as in the case of a slave); rather she is a hired worker employed by him, and a hired worker is like any other non-mahram female when 
    it comes to hijab. 
The fifth condition: 
He should not be alone with her. If there is 
    no one else in the house with him, it is not permissible for him to employ her at all. If there are other people in the house with him but the 
    household members go out from the house and leave him alone with this servant, that is not permissible, because the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No man should be alone with a woman unless her mahram is present.” 
As’ilat al-Baab al-Maftooh, 
    no. 619 
He also said: 
Bringing a female servant from her country without a mahram is haraam, because the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No woman should travel alone without a mahram.” But if she is already in the country and 
    he brings her to work as a servant in his house, if she is going to come to the house, do what is needed then go back to her own house, there is 
    no doubt that this is permissible, but if she is going to stay in his house, this is a dangerous matter, especially if he has adolescent sons, for 
    then there is the fear of immorality as has happened on some occasions. But if he does not have adolescent sons, then we hope – in sha Allaah – 
    that there is nothing wrong with that, but it is better to avoid that and for her to stay elsewhere and come to do her work in the morning or 
    afternoon and then go back. 
As’ilat al-Baab al-Maftooh, 
    no. 526. 
In conclusion: because of the shar’i 
    restrictions that we have noted above, and because there is no need in your case – since the parents do not want to bring a servant – then we do 
    not advise the brother to bring a servant.

    Seeking blessing from righteous people is of two types. 

    1 – Seeking blessings by asking them to make du’aa’ to Allaah 
    for one. This is permissible, subject to the condition that they be known to 
    be righteous and pious and that they will not be exposed to fitnah thereby. 

    2 – Seeking blessing through their relics, such as their clothes and belongings, etc. This is not permissible and is a form of reprehensible bid’ah (innovation).",Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him)

    If a person is listening to the Qur’aan on a tape player or whatever, then he wants to speak or to stop listening, then he should turn it off and stop listening to the Qur’aan so that he will not be inattentive towards it.",Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him)
26286,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26286,How should I send salaams upon the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when visiting his grave?,"I want to visit the Mosque of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in al-Madeenah al-Munawwarah. How should I send salaams upon the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and is visiting his Mosque obligatory?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Praise be to Allah, and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allah.
Visiting the Mosque of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is not obligatory, but if you want to travel to Madeenah in order to pray in the Mosque of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), that is Sunnah. When you enter the Mosque, pray first, then go to the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and say: “As-salaamu ‘alayka ayyuhan-Nabiyyu wa rahmat-Allahi wa barakaatuhu, wa sall-Allahu ‘alayka wa ‘ala aalika wa ashaabika (Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of Allah and His blessings. May Allah bless you and your family and companions).” Send lots of blessings and salaams upon him, because it was reported that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Send blessings upon me, for your blessings will reach me no matter where you are.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2042). Then send salaams upon Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, and pray that Allah may be pleased with them. But do not touch the grave or make du’aa’ there; rather move away and make du’aa’ to Allah from wherever you want in the mosque or elsewhere. It was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not set out to travel to any mosque except three: al-Masjid al-Haraam [in Makkah], Masjid al-Rasool (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) [the Prophet’s Mosque in Madeenah], and al-Masjid al-Aqsa [in Jerusalem].” (Narrated by Imaam Ahmad, 1751; al-Bukhaari, 1189; Muslim, 1379)
And Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.","Al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Iftaa’ (Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas), 9/117"
26288,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26288,No contradiction between the two aayahs,"How can we reconcile between these two aayahs (interpretation of the meanings): “Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills” [al-Nisa’ 4:48] and “And verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them (till his death)” [Ta-Ha 20:82] Is there any contradiction between them?",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is no contradiction between them. The first aayah refers to one who dies in shirk (associating others with Allaah) without having repented from it. He will not be forgiven and his abode will be Hell, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): “Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allaah, then Allaah has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers) there are no helpers” [al-Maa'idah 5:72] “But if they had joined in worship others with Allaah, all that they used to do would have been of no benefit to them” [al-An’aam 6:88]  And there are many similar aayahs. The second aayah –   “And verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them (till his death)” [Ta-Ha 20:82 – interpretation of the meaning] – refers to those who repent. Similarly Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say: O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Zumar 39:53] The scholars are agreed that this verse refers to those who have repented. And Allaah is the Source of strength.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), 4/419"
26298,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26298,Women meeting for halaqahs and study circles,"I am asking weather it right for women to have halaqas or study circles excusively for sisters in the mosque or at a home.I heard it is not right for sisters to have their own gatherings but rather to learn from the ulama whenever there is an opportunity.

Would you please clarify this and give me a detailed answer, as, if it is wrong I would not like to participate in them. And how would I explain to sisters who think it is better for them to spend the time learning rather than waisting time or going to the malls.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is no reason why women should not have 
    study circles that are exclusively for them, whether that is in the mosque or in one of their houses. Rather this is something that is prescribed 
    in Islam. The women asked the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to give them a special session separate from the men, and 
    he responded to their request. 
Al-Bukhaari (7310) and Muslim (2634) narrated 
    from Abu Sa’eed that a woman came to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allaah, 
    the men have taken all your time; give us a day when we can come to you and you can teach us what Allaah has taught you.” He said, “Gather 
    together on such and such a day in such and such a place (according to a report narrated by Ahmad (7310), your appointment is in the house of So 
    and so).” So they gathered and the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to them and taught them what Allaah 
    had taught him. Then he said, “There is no woman among you whose three children die (before her) but they will be a shield for her from the Fire.” 
    A woman asked, “O Messenger of Allaah, what about two?” and she repeated it twice. He said, “And two, and two, and two.”
 Undoubtedly if a woman spends her time 
    seeking knowledge that is better for her than wasting her time in going to the mall etc, but her intention should not be to fill her time so that 
    she will not go to the mall; rather her intention should be to worship Allaah and draw closer to Him by seeking knowledge; to dispel her ignorance 
    so that she can worship Allaah with proper understanding; and to teach other sisters in faith; and to raise a generation that is educated in the 
    basic issues of Islam and its great teachings.
 May Allaah bless us with beneficial knowledge and righteous deeds.",Islam Q&A
