 Is keeping pictures prohibited in Islam? 


Is keeping children’s toys prohibited?","Praise be to Allah.Types of image-making
Image-making is of two types: one by hand and the other by means of machines. 
·         Image-making by hand is prohibited , and is in fact a major sin, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who does it. He did not differentiate between images that have a shadow (i.e., three-dimensional) or those that are simply drawn (two-dimensional), according to the more correct scholarly opinion, because of the general meaning of the Hadith.  
·         With regard to image-making by means of machines, i.e. cameras, there is a difference of opinion among the later scholars on this matter. Some of them forbid it and some of them allow it. 
In order to be on the safe side, it is better to avoid that, because it is one of the doubtful areas. And whoever is careful with regard to doubtful matters will protect his religious commitment and his honour. But if he needs to do that for a specific purpose such as proving his identity, there is nothing wrong with that because if there is a need, the matter is no longer doubtful.
 Is keeping pictures prohibited in Islam? 
With regard to keeping pictures , this is also of two types: 
·         The first type is keeping images that are three-dimensional. Keeping them is prohibited. Ibn Al-`Arabi (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated that there is consensus on this point. (See Fath Al-Bari, p. 388, vol. 10) He said: This consensus has to do with things other than girls’ dolls. 
It was narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “I used to play with dolls in the presence of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and I had friends who would play with me. When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered they would hide themselves and he would call them to come and play with me.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, no. 5779; Muslim, no. 2440) 
·         The second type is images that are not three-dimensional. These are of different types: 
1.       Those that are hung up to be venerated and respected , as in the case of pictures of kings, presidents, ministers, scholars etc. This is prohibited because it involves exaggeration about a created being.
2.       Those that are hung up for the sake of memory , such as hanging up pictures of one's friends. This is also prohibited, because of the Hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari from Abu Talhah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: `The angels do not enter any house in which there is a dog or an image.’” (Narrated by Muslim, 2104).
3.       Those that are hung up for the purpose of adornment. These are also prohibited because of the Hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came back from a journey and I had hung a patterned curtain on which there were images over (the door of) a room of mine. When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw it, he tore it and said, `The most severely punished of the people on the Day of Resurrection will be those who tried to imitate the creation of Allah.’” She said: “So I made it into one or two cushions.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5610; Muslim, 2107)
4.       Those that are treated with disrespect, such as images in carpets and pillows. Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated from the majority of scholars among the Companions and Tabi’in that these are permissible.
5.       Those that have unfortunately become widespread and are difficult to avoid, such as images engraved on coins etc which have become a problem for the Muslim ummah. It seems to me that there is no sin on the one who acquires these without wanting to acquire images.
Is keeping children’s toys prohibited?
An exception is made in the case of children’s toys, which are not regarded as prohibited or disliked. But what are the toys which are exempted? We know that the toys of the past did not have eyes and lips and noses as they do nowadays. I think it is better to avoid these toys and limit oneself to those the kind of toys that were known previously. (See Fatawa Al-`Aqidah by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, p. 66, 663, 679)

20327,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20327,Apostasy in Islam,"As a non-Muslim, I find myself Intrigued and attracted to your faith. However, I find it difficult to comprehend how a man can be sentenced to death for speaking (Salman Rushdie). I would have thought that we as humans do not have that right to make those decisions, only God can.","Apostasy in Islam refers to when a Muslim becomes a disbeliever by saying a clear statement to that effect, or by uttering words which imply that disbelief, or he does something that implies that disbelief.","What is apostasy?


What constitutes apostasy?


What is the ruling on the apostate?","Praise be to Allah.We thank you for your confidence in us and for sending this question to us, and we appreciate your being intrigued by our beliefs and your eagerness to find out the answer. We welcome you as a visitor and reader and learner. 
What stood out from your letter is that you are impressed with the religion of Islam . This is a good sign for us and for you. We are happy for our religion to reach people like you who are seeking for the truth. 
Our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us that this religion would reach all places on this earth. Tamهm al-Dari said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: ‘This matter (i.e., Islam) will certainly reach everywhere that night and day reach, and Allah will not leave any house or tent [i.e., all dwellings, in towns and in the desert], but Allah will cause this religion to enter it, and some people will be honoured because of it [by converting] and others will be humiliated because of it [for refusing to embrace it], and they will be ruled by the Muslims, an honour which Allah will bestow on Islam and a humiliation which He will inflict on kufr (disbelief).” (Narrated by Ahmad, 16344; classed as sahهh by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Sahهhah, 3) 
In your case, your admiration for Islam will motivate you to find out what this pure monotheistic religion teaches , and how it is in accordance with sound human nature and common sense. We advise you to completely avoid any preconceptions that may influence you and take your time in reading about the teachings of the Islamic religion . 
With regard to your question, “However, I find it difficult to comprehend how a man can be sentenced to death for speaking. I would have thought that we as humans do not have that right to make those decisions, only God can” – what you say is correct, because no-one has the right to condemn another person to death without evidence from the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
The ruling of execution because of a word that somebody utters is what the Muslim scholars call al-riddah (apostasy). What is apostasy and what constitutes apostasy? What is the ruling on the apostate (al-murtadd)? 
What is apostasy?
Riddah (apostasy ) in Islam refers to when a Muslim becomes a disbeliever by saying a clear statement to that effect, or by uttering words which imply that (i.e., which imply disbelief), or he does something that implies that (i.e., an action which implies disbelief). 
What constitutes apostasy?
The matters which constitute apostasy are divided into four categories: 

Apostasy in beliefs, such as associating others with Allah, denying Him, or denying an attribute which is proven to be one of His attributes, or by affirming that Allah has a son. Whoever believes that is an apostate and a disbeliever.
Apostasy in words, such as insulting Allah or the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
Apostasy in actions, such as throwing the Quran into a filthy place, because doing that shows disrespect towards the words of Allah, so it is a sign that one does not believe. Other such actions include prostrating to an idol or to the sun or moon.
Apostasy by omission, such as not doing any of the rituals of Islam, or turning away from following it altogether.

What is the ruling on the apostate? 
If a Muslim apostatizes and meets the conditions of apostasy – i.e., he is of sound mind, an adult and does that of his own free will – then his blood may be shed with impunity. He is to be executed by the Muslim ruler or by his deputy – such as the judge, and he is not to be washed (after death, in preparation for burial), the funeral prayer is not to be offered for him and he is not to be buried with the Muslims.  
The evidence that the apostate is to be executed is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Whoever changes his religion, execute him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2794) What is meant by religion here is Islam (i.e., whoever changes from Islam to another religion). 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to shed the blood of a Muslim who bears witness that there is no god except Allah and that I am His Messenger, except in one of three cases: a soul for a soul (i.e., in the case of murder); a married man who commits adultery; and one who leaves his religion and splits from the jama’ah (main group of Muslims).” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6878; Muslim, 1676) (See al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 22/180) 
Thus, it will be clear to you that execution of the apostate is something that is commanded by Allah, when He commanded us to obey the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority.” [al-Nisa 4:59]
And the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has commanded us to execute the apostate as in the hadith quoted above: “Whoever changes his religion, execute him.” 
It may need some time for you to be convinced about this matter, and for you to think about it. Perhaps you think that if a person follows the truth and enters into it and embraces the one true religion which Allah has enjoined, then we allow him to leave it quite easily whenever he wants and to utter the words of disbelief that put him outside of Islam, so he can reject Allah, His Messenger, His Books and His religion, and there is no punishment as deterrent, how will that affect him and others who enter the religion? 
Do you not see that this would make the one true religion, that everyone should follow, like a shop or store which a person can enter when he wants and leave when he wants, and it may encourage others to forsake the truth. 
Moreover, this is not someone who has never known the truth and practiced it and worshipped in accordance with it; rather this is a person who has known the truth, and practiced the religion and done the rituals of worship, so the punishment is no greater than he deserves. Moreover, such strong rulings as this are only applied to such a person whose life is no longer considered to be useful, because he knew the truth and followed the religion, then he left it and forsook it. What soul can be more evil than the soul of such a person? 
In conclusion, the answer is that Allah is the One Who revealed this religion and enjoined it. He is the One Who ruled that the one who enters it and then leaves it is to be executed. This ruling does not come from the Muslims’ ideas or suggestions. As this is the case, then we must follow the ruling of Allah so long as we are content to accept Him as our Lord and God.
 May Allah help us and you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him. We thank you once again.

    of sleep or forgetfulness has to make it up when he remembers it, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Whoever forgets a prayer or sleeps and misses it, let him pray it when he remembers it, for there is no other expiation for it than that.” 
Al-Bukhaari, 572; Muslim, 1564. 
And it was proven that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made up the Sunnah of Zuhr after praying ‘Asr. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4370; Muslim, 834. 
Al-Nawawi said: This clearly refers to making 
    up a missed Sunnah prayer, so it is more appropriate that missed obligatory prayers should be made up.

    with no excuse has to repent to Allaah sincerely, and he does not have to make them up or offer any expiation (kafaarah), because omitting the 
    obligatory prayers deliberately is major kufr, as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The covenant that stands 
    between us and them is prayer; whoever gives it up is a kaafir.” Narrated by Ahmad, 22428; al-Tirmidhi, 2621; al-Nasaa’i, 462. And he said: 
    “Between a man and shirk and kufr there stands his giving up prayer.” Narrated by Muslim, 242. There is no expiation for that except sincere 
    repentance. See Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 6/50 
Prayer is an act of worship that is to performed at specific times, and whoever does not do an 
    act of worship that is tied to a specific time – such as prayer and fasting – until that time is over, with no excuse, then repents, does not have 
    to make up what he omitted, because this act of worship has been limited by the Lawgiver to the beginning and ending of that time. 
Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 
    1/322. 
But if a person misses a prayer for a valid 
    excuse such as sleeping or forgetting, his expiation is to offer the prayer when he remembers it, and there is no other expiation required, as the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever forgets a prayer or sleeps and misses it, let him pray it when he 
    remembers, and there is no other expiation for it but that.”

20343,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20343,His wife does not accept advice. What is the solution?,"I got maried 4 years before. My wife was not having any religious attitude at all. She was strongly against observing hijab/niqab. She didn't even covered her head. On my asking to observe hijab, she simply refused and said that she was a learned girl and that she knows her good or bad. I didn't loose heart and kept on trying to convince her and engrave in her heart the fear and greatness of allah. Now after 4 years, there is a little improvement. She has started a little bit of hijab(i.e., she covers her head and chest) but is still not convinced to do niqaab. She offers her prayer but recites quran wrongly (i.e., her pronunciation is not correct). She is not interested to learn reading quran. She is casual to learn about the problems of her periods and mixes up her days and leaves the prayers one or two days more than her periods. She doesnot accept any body's remarks and considers her own decision as final. What line of action should I adopt as she does not bear any harsh words or behavior.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly your wife is persisting in making a serious mistake, and we ask Allah to guide her. The most serious thing that you mention about her is the matter of her careless attitude towards prayer, because not praying leads – Allah forbid – to one becoming beyond the pale of Islam, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “What stands between a man and shirk or kufr is his giving up prayer.” (Narrated by Muslim, 82). This applies to one who does not pray at all. But some of the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) thought that a person who fails to pray one prayer on time also becomes a kaafir. See al-Mughni, 3/354). This points to the seriousness of the matter. 
You have done your duty towards your wife by guiding and advising her, and this has borne fruit. Even though it may be incomplete, it is still a positive step which indicates that there is goodness in your wife and that she is prepared to change the rest. Yes, that may be slow but it is possible. You see that in the beginning she was not convinced of hijaab and did not wear it at all, but after the noble efforts on your part she has started to wear it partially. Even though it is not full hijaab as it should be worn, it still gives us hope and points to hidden goodness in her. You can bring it to the surface so that she will wear proper hijaab on the basis of conviction and her own desire to do it, as time goes by and as you continue your efforts. This means that you must continue to advise her and not give up, and you will be rewarded for that. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If one man were to be guided at your hands, that will be better for you than red camels [i.e., the best kind].” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, no. 6). 
Always remind her of Allah and make her fear Him; tell her of the importance of prayer in Islam and that she has to learn the things that have to do with prayer, such as the rulings on menstruation and post-partum bleeding, because it is obligatory on every woman, when her bleeding stops, to hasten to do ghusl when the time for prayer comes. Try to bring her useful books on that topic, such as the essay by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) on “The Natural Blood of Women” or some useful tapes. You can help her by sitting and reading with her, or listening to the tapes with her, because this is a kind of cooperating in righteousness and piety. 
[Translator’s note: Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s essay is available in English with additional notes by Bilaal Philips, under the title Islamic Rules on Menstruation and Post-Natal Bleeding, published by Dar al-Fatah, Sharjah, UAE].
With regard to what you mention about her mistakes in reading Quran, if the mistakes are in her recitation of al-Faatihah and are such that they distort or change the meanings of the words – such as reading an’amta [“You [masculine] have bestowed Your grace”] as an’amti [i.e., feminine form of the verb], or any other mistake which would make a listener understand something other than the correct meaning – this means that she has to learn how to read properly, because such mistakes make the prayer invalid, as reciting al-Faatihah is a pillar or essential part of the prayer, without which the prayer is not valid. But if the mistakes do not change the meaning , such as reading “ar-Rahmaan ir-Raheem” as “ar-Rahmaan ur-Raheem”, this does not invalidate the prayer. 
The Muslim must learn to read Quran so that he can recite it correctly, and so that he will not distort the Quran without realizing. 
You have to help her with that, either by teaching her yourself, or by showing her things that will help her, such as tapes of the Quran by readers who are known to recite well. You must also explain to her the virtues of reading Quran and the reward for that. 
So in conclusion you have to continue teaching and advising her, and be patient in doing so. Do not say that she has only responded a little after so much time and effort, for even this little is blessed by Allah. We have a good example in the Prophets, for Nooh called his people for nine hundred and fifty years. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And indeed We sent Nooh (Noah) to his people, and he stayed among them a thousand years less fifty years [inviting them to believe in the Oneness of Allah (Monotheism), and discard the false gods and other deities]” [al-‘Ankaboot 29:14]
Yet despite that only a few of his people believed in him. 
Make her enjoy learning about her religion by making it easy for her. Encourage her if you see that she is responding to you, even if it is something small. Know that you are an example for her, so watch what you do and say. Beware of telling her to do something then being the first one to go against that, or of telling her not to do something then being the first one to do it, for this will stop her from accepting your advice, or will delay her. 
You have to be gentle in the way you advise her, for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah is Kind and loves kindness, and He confers upon kindness that which He does not confer upon severity and does not confer upon anything else besides it (kindness).” (Narrated by Muslim, 2593). 
You must also make a lot of du’aa’ and beseech Allah to open her heart to obedience towards Him and make His religion and laws beloved to her. I ask Allah to help you to do good.",Islam Q&A

It is not permissible to go to fortunetellers and soothsayers and other such charlatans. Whoever goes to them and asks them about anything, his prayer will not be accepted for forty days, and whoever believes their claim to have knowledge of the unseen or to be able to relieve hardship and bring benefits is a kaafir, as it says in the saheeh ahaadeeth narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
It is not permissible to use turquoise (as a charm) and amulets. A stern warning is used in the saheeh Sunnah to the one who does that.
It was narrated from ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir al-Juhani that a group of people came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he accepted the allegiance of nine and refrained from accepting the allegiance of one. They said: “O Messenger of Allah, you accepted the allegiance of nine and not this one.” He said: “He is wearing an amulet.” He put his hand in and took it off, then he accepted his allegiance, and said: “Whoever uses an amulet has committed shirk (has associated partners with Allah).” Narrated by Ahmad, 16969.

In the answer to question no. 10542 you will find the details of the ahaadeeth which have been narrated concerning amulets, and the rulings of the scholars on amulets containing verses from the Qur’aan and amulets consisting of other things. 
In that answer, Shaykh Sulaymaan ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab is quoted as saying: 
“This scholarly difference was concerning hanging up amulets which contain Qur’aan or names and attributes of Allah, so what do you think about the things which were innovated later on, doing spells (ruqyah) using the names of shayaateen (devils) and others and hanging them up, and even being attached to those shayaateen, seeking refuge in them, slaughtering animals for them, asking them to ward off harm and bring benefits – actions which are pure shirk? This is prevalent among many of the people, except for those whom Allah keeps safe and sound.” 
And Shaykh Haafiz Hukmi said: 
If they (amulets) contain anything other than the two revelations and instead contain mumbo-jumbo from the Jews or worshippers of the temple, stars or angels, or those who use the services of the jinn, etc., or they are made of pearls, strings, iron rings, etc., then this is shirk, i.e., hanging them up or wearing them is shirk, beyond a doubt.

The Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) connected the command to offer the eclipse prayer to actual sighting of the eclipse, not to news from astronomers that an eclipse was going to happen or to its happening in another country.","When to offer eclipse prayer?


Can we offer eclipse prayer on the basis of astronomers’ reports?","Praise be to Allah.When to offer eclipse prayer?
There are authentic Hadiths according to which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined offering the eclipse prayer and reciting Dhikr and Du`as when the Muslims see an eclipse of the sun or the moon. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah and they do not become eclipsed for the death or birth of anyone. Allah sends them to make His slaves fear (Him), so if you see that, then pray and make Du`a until it is over.” 
Another version reads: “So if you see that, then hasten to remember Allah, call upon Him, and seek His forgiveness.” So he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) connected the command to pray, make Du`a, remember Allah, and ask for forgiveness to actual sighting of the eclipse and not to the reports of the astronomers. 
What all the Muslims must do is adhere to the Sunnah and act in accordance with it, and to beware of everything that is contrary to it. 
Can we offer eclipse prayer on the basis of astronomers’ reports?
Hence we know that those who offer the eclipse prayer on the basis of astronomers’ reports are making a mistake and going against the Sunnah. 
It should also be noted that it is not prescribed for the people who live in a country where the eclipse is not happening to offer the prayer. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) connected the command to pray, etc., to actual sighting of the eclipse , not to news from astronomers that an eclipse was going to happen, or to its happening in another country. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it).” [Al-Hashr 59:7] 
“Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow.” [Al-Ahzab 33:21]
When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) offered the eclipse prayer, when the eclipse happened in Madinah and the people saw it, Allah said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And let those who oppose his (Muhammad’s) commandment (Sunnah) beware, lest some Fitnah (trials, afflictions, dissension, strife, etc.) should befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them.” [Al-Nur 24:63]
It is known that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was the most knowledgeable and most sincere of people, and that he was the one who conveyed the rulings from Allah. If it was prescribed to offer the eclipse prayer on the basis of astronomers’ reports, or when an eclipse occurs in another region that is only seen by the local inhabitants, then he would have said so and would have guided his Ummah to do that. 
Since he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not say that, rather he said the opposite, and he told his Ummah to base their actions on actual sighting of the eclipse , thus this prayer is only prescribed for those who see the eclipse and in whose land it occurs.

Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
The word al-soofiyyah (Sufism) refers to wearing woollen clothes; this is the correct meaning. It was said that it comes from the word safwat al-fuqaha’ (the elite of the fuqaha’) or from Soofah ibn Add ibn Taanijah, an Arab tribe that was known for its asceticism, or from Ahl al-Suffah (poor Muslims in Madeenah at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) who used to stay in the mosque), or from al-Safa (the mountain in Makkah), or from the word al-safwah (meaning elite), or from the phrase al-saff al-muqaddam bayna yaday Allaah (the foremost rank before Allaah). All of these views are weak (da’eef); if any of them were true then the word would be saffi or safaa’i or safawi, not sufi.

Sufism (tasawwuf) did not appear until after the first three generations which the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) praised when he said, “The best of mankind is my generation, then those who come after them, then those who come after them…” (narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2652; Muslim, 2533; from the hadeeth of Ibn Mas’ood).

With regard to the word soofiyyah (Sufism), it was not known during the first three generations, rather it became known after that. 
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 11/5 
This tareeqah and its like are among the innovated ways that go against the Qur’aan and Sunnah and the way followed by the best generations. All the shaykhs of these tareeqahs have made up their own wirds (phrases to be uttered as dhikr), hizb (books of du’aa’ to be read daily by their followers) and ways of worship by which each of them may be distinguished from the others; this goes against sharee’ah and divides the ummah. 
Allaah has blessed this ummah by perfecting its religion and completing His Favour upon it, so everyone who comes up with an act of worship or a way that was not brought by sharee’ah is effectively rejecting what Allaah has said and accusing the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) of betraying the trust. 
Along with this innovation of theirs, they may also be lying by claiming that they received their tareeqah from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or that they are following the path and guidance of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs (al-khulafa’ al-raashideen). 
The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: 
Is there any such thing in Islam as the numerous tareeqahs like the Shaadhilyyah, Khalwatiyyah etc? If there is such a thing, what is the evidence for that? What is the meaning of the verses in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And verily, this is My straight path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His path. This He has ordained for you that you may become Al‑Muttaqoon (the pious)”
[al-An’aam 6:153] 
“And upon Allaah is the responsibility to explain the Straight Path. But there are ways that turn aside (such as Paganism, Judaism, Christianity). And had He willed, He would have guided you all (mankind)”
[al-Nahl 16:9]
What are the ways that separate people from the path of Allaah, and what is the way of Allaah? What is the meaning of the hadeeth narrated by Ibn Mas’ood, according to which the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) drew a line and said, “This is the path of guidance,” then he drew lines to its right and another to its left and said, “These are other paths and on each path there is a devil calling people to it”? 
They answered: 
There is no such thing in Islam as the tareeqahs that you mentioned, or anything else like them. What there is in Islam is what is indicated by the two verses and the hadeeth that you quoted, and what was indicated by the hadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Jews split into seventy-one sects, and the Christians split into seventy-two sects. My ummah will split into seventy-three sects, all of which will be in Hell except one.” It was asked, “Who are they, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “Those who follow the same path as I and my companions are on today.” And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “A group among my ummah will continue to follow the truth and to be victorious, and they will not be harmed by those who forsake them or oppose them, until the command of Allaah comes to pass when they are like that.” The truth lies in following the Qur’aan and the saheeh, unambiguous Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). This is the path of Allaah, this is the Straight Path. This is the straight line mentioned in the hadeeth of Ibn Mas’ood, and this is what was followed by the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (may Allaah be pleased with them and with their followers among the early generations (salaf) of this ummah, and with those who follow their path). All other tareeqahs or groups are the paths mentioned in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“… and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His path…”
[al-An’aam 6:153]
