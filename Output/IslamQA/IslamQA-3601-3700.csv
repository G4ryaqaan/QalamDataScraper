    call non-Muslims to Islam with the little knowledge that he has?","Assalam u alaikum. Is it allowed for
      someone with little knowledge of Islam to inform other people about Islam - just the
      basics i.e. the five pillars and a few brief points on Islam, directing them to more
      knowledable sources for further discussion e.g. websites. Or am I doing an injustice to
      these people? By only giveing them a brief intro and leaving them as they are? For I read
      that everyone will see Islam at some point in their life. That being the case, if I only
      give someone a brief intro would it be okay?",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is nothing at all wrong with conveying what you know of the
    religion of Allaah to non-Muslims, as long as you are certain that it is correct, such as
    the basics that you mention, like the five pillars of Islam or the pillars of eemaan
    (faith). Indeed, this is probably obligatory upon you, as Allaah says (interpretation of
    the meaning): “Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that
    is good (Islam), enjoining al-ma’roof (i.e., Islamic monotheism and all that Islam
    orders one to do) and forbidding al-munkar (polytheism and disbelief and all that Islam
    has forbidden). And it is they who are the successful.” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:104]
The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
    “Convey from me, even an aayah.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari). Ibn Hajar (may
    Allaah have mercy on him) said: He said in the hadeeth, “even an aayah”, meaning
    one aayah, as if he was saying that every listener should hasten to convey whatever aayaat
    he heard, even if it is only a few. Some of the Sahaabah set out to call their tribes to
    Islam when they had only a little knowledge that they had gained during the brief time
    they had sat with the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). But even
    though their knowledge was so little, it was correct and was blessed, and because of their
    sincerity, Allaah benefitted others through it. Al-Tufayl ibn ‘Umar went from Makkah
    to his people Daws with the limited amount of knowledge that he had, then he came to the
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in Madeenah accompanied by eighty
    families of Daws, all of whom had become Muslim, and among whom was Abu Hurayrah (may
    Allaah be pleased with him).
Know that some non-Muslims may become Muslim for the slightest reason
    and by hearing the briefest word said to them. Do not think that the knowledge you have is
    too little for the purposes of conveying the Message. “… invite them to your
    Lord. Verily! You indeed are on the (true) straight guidance.” [al-Hajj 22:67 –
    interpretation of the meaning].",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

The shaykh, may Allaah preserve him, replied as follows:
No, it is not permissible for him to stop at the liquor store for his

You must exhort this woman, in a gentle manner, and remind
    her, kindly, why she was created in this life. There follow a few useful suggestions which
    include both serious pursuits and permissible forms of leisure activities.
Doing acts of worship such as reciting dhikr and wird, salaah, reading
        Qur’aan, fasting, and thinking about the signs of Allaah in His creation.
Adopting an Islamic cause in the place where she is living, and taking
        part in it, such as teaching Muslim girls, supporting an Islamic magazine by sending
        articles, statistics and useful information of interest concerning Muslims in the West,
        taking part in charitable projects to help Muslim orphans, widows, divorcees and elderly,
        or joining a committee to help organize social programs and celebrations for Muslim girls
        on Eid.
Finding righteous (female) companions to meet with and good (females)
        neighbours to visit.
Reading Islamic books in particular and useful stories in general.
Taking part in da’wah activities, women’s activities and
        preschool programs in Islamic centres.
Listening to tapes and lectures, writing summaries of them, and
        distributing the summaries to anyone who could benefit from them.
Doing arts and crafts, and cooking items to be sold to raise funds for
        the Islamic centre.
Taking an interest in computers and computer programs. This is a vast
        field that can fill a lot of time, and the computer can be used to do a lot of good things
        as well as providing entertainment in the form of permissible games.
Spinning, weaving, cutting out and sewing.
Gardening.
Exercising at home.

    introduce that window of evil to your home. We ask Allaah to grant your wife a righteous
    child in the near future, so that she may fill her time with taking care of him. May

3633,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3633,Is Watching TV Prohibited in Islam?,"Is watching TV permitted in Islam? If so, under what conditions?","The issue of watching films is not free from numerous reservations from a Shar`i point of view, such as uncovering `Awrah, listening to music, spreading corrupt beliefs and calling for imitation of the disbelievers.",,"Praise be to Allah.The issue of watching films is not free from numerous reservations from a Shar`i point of view, such as uncovering `Awrah, listening to music, spreading corrupt beliefs and calling for imitation of the disbelievers. Allah has commanded us to lower our gaze, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts). That is purer for them. Verily, Allah is All-Aware of what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts).” [An-Nur 24:30-31]
Since lowering the gaze is the basis of protecting the private parts, it is mentioned first. Allah has made the eyes the reflection of the heart: if a person lowers his gaze, the desire in his heart will be reduced, but if a person looks and stares, the desire in his heart will be provoked.
Muslim narrated (1218) that Al-Fadl ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) was riding behind the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on the Day of Sacrifice (Yawm An-Nahr) from Muzdalifah to Mina, when some women riding on camel-borne sedan chairs passed by. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) turned his [Al-Fadl’s] head away. This was prevention and denunciation through action, for if looking were permissible he would have approved of what he did.
Al-Bukhari narrated (6343) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every son of Adam has his share of Zina decreed for him, and he will undoubtedly get his share. The eye commits Zina and its Zina is looking. The tongue commits Zina and its Zina is speaking; the feet commit Zina and their Zina is walking; the hands commit Zina and their Zina is touching. The heart longs and desires for something and the private parts confirm that or deny it.”
He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) began by mentioning the eye because this is how the Zina of the hand, foot, heart and private parts begins. By mentioning the Zina of the tongue, he pointed out that the mouth can commit Zina by speaking. And he stated that the private parts can confirm that, if they make the deed (Zina) happen, or deny it if that does not happen.
This Hadith gives the clearest indication that the eye can sin by looking and that this is its Zina. This is a refutation to those who say that looking is allowed in all circumstances.
It was also reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O `Ali, do not follow a look with a second, for the first [unintended] look is allowable but not the second.”
A look has the same effect on the heart as an arrow has on its victim. If it does not kill him, it will wound him. It is like a spark of fire in dried grass; if it does not burn all of it, it will still burn some of it. May Allah have mercy on the one who said:
“Everything starts with a look, and big fires start from little sparks.
How often has a heart been dealt a fatal blow like that of an arrow, with no need for a bow.
As long as a man’s eyes are looking around, looking into the eyes of others, he is in a state of danger.
His eye delights in that which could destroy his heart. The joy that may lead to harm is not welcome.”
Hence Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Fatawa 3/227:
“With regard to television , it is a dangerous device and its harmful effects are very great, like those of the cinema, or even worse. We know from the research that has been written about it and from the words of experts in Arab countries and elsewhere enough to indicate that it is dangerous and very harmful to Islamic beliefs (`Aqidah), morals and the state of society. This is because it includes the presentation of bad morals, tempting scenes, immoral pictures, semi-nakedness, destructive speech, and disbelief . It encourages imitation of their conduct and ways of dressing, respect for their leaders, neglect of Islamic conduct and ways of dressing, and looking down on the scholars and heroes of Islam. 
It damages their image by portraying them in an off-putting manner that makes people despise them and ignore them. It shows people how to cheat, steal, hatch plots and commit acts of violence against others. 
Undoubtedly, anything that produces so many bad results should be stopped and shunned, and we have to close all the doors that could lead to it. If some of our brothers denounce it and speak out against it, we cannot blame them, because this is a part of sincerity towards Allah and towards other people.
Whoever thinks that this device (TV) can be free of these evils and can be used only for good purposes if it is censored properly is exaggerating and is making a big mistake, because the censor may miss things and most people nowadays want to imitate the foreigners. It is very rare to find censors who are doing their job properly, especially nowadays when most people are only interested in time-wasting entertainment and things that turn people away from true guidance. Reality bears witness to that.”

He does not command anything except that which is in peoples’ best interests and He does not forbid anything except that which is harmful.","Wisdom behind prohibitions in Islam


Is there a connection between things prohibited in this world and those allowed in the Hereafter?


Why is silk haram for men?","Praise be to Allah.Wisdom behind prohibitions in Islam
It should be known that Allah, may He be exalted and glorified, is Wise in His commands and prohibitions. He does not command anything except that which is in peoples’ best interests and He does not forbid anything except that which is harmful.
People may or may not come to understand the reasons behind these commands and prohibitions , although Allah has His Wisdom in any given issue. 
Having said that, it is still not right to make following a command or prohibition dependent upon knowing the wisdom behind it; rather we should hasten to carry out the commands of the Shari`ah, regardless of whether the wisdom behind it is clear to us or not. If it is clear, then praise be to Allah, and if it is not, then the Muslim should not let the fact that he does not know it prevent him from acting in accordance with the ruling of the Shari`ah. 
This is true submission to the command of Allah, and Islam means submission to Allah, may He be exalted, and obeying Him. If a person makes his actions dependent on understanding matters which may or may not convince him, he is in effect following his own thoughts and desires, not his Lord and Master.
The above does not mean that it is not important to look for the wisdom behind the rules of the Shari`ah, or that doing so is forbidden, but we should not make knowing the reasons a condition for acting upon the ruling.
Is there a connection between things prohibited in this world and those allowed in the Hereafter?
There is no connection between things that are prohibited in this world and those that are allowed in the Hereafter. It is not correct to think of the Hereafter as being like this world; each realm has its own rules and laws.
It is not correct to suggest that something is permitted in this world on the basis that it is permitted in Paradise or in the Hereafter , otherwise we would end up allowing things that we know from the basics of Islam are forbidden , such as drinking wine, taking more than four wives, singing etc. On this basis, the confusion reflected in the question about silk being forbidden in this world although it is permitted in Paradise should be cleared up.
Why is silk haram for men?
The scholars have discussed the reasons for silk being forbidden for men in this world. For example, al-’Allamah Ibn al-Qayyim suggested in his brilliant work Zad al-Ma'ad that
“Among those who believe that there is reason and wisdom (behind the rulings of Islam) and they are the majority are some who answer that Islam has forbidden it so that people will keep away from it and give it up for the sake of Allah, so they will be rewarded for that. 
Others reply that it was basically created for women, as is the case with gold jewellery, so it was forbidden for men because it can corrupt them by making them resemble women. 
Some of them said that silk was forbidden for men because of what it may lead to in the way of pride, showing off and self-admiration. 
Some of them said that silk was forbidden for men because when it touches the body, it makes a man effeminate and goes against his masculinity and manliness, so if he wears it his heart gains the characteristics of femininity and softness, as is obvious, even if he was the most masculine and chivalrous of men.
There is no doubt that wearing silk will diminish these manly characteristics, if not take them away altogether. Whoever is too dense to understand this should just submit to the Wise Lawmaker.” (Zad al-Ma`ad, 4/80)

JazakAllahu khairan.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, may
    Allaah preserve him, who answered as follows:
It was reported that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
    upon him) addressed the people on the day of ‘Arafaah, and said: “The riba of
    the Jaahiliyyah is cancelled.” This was in spite of the fact that these contracts had
    been made during the time of Jaahiliyyah and before the ruling on riba was established. If
    it is possible for him not to pay the interest on the loan, then he should not pay it, but
    he should not make a gain twice. The Muslim judge or leader should take the amount he was
    supposed to pay in riba and give it in charity or put it in the bayl al-maal (Islamic
    treasury). 
Question:
You said, “he should not make a gain twice.” What does this
    mean?
Answer:
The first gain was when he benefitted from the money that he took from
    the bank, for example. The second gain is the interest which, if he does not pay it to the
    bank, he will have made a second gain… But still, he should not pay it to the one who
    loaned him the money on the basis of interest. For example, if he borrowed a million and
    owes interest of one hundred thousand, do we say pay back the million and keep the hundred
    thousand? No, we say pay back the million but do not give the hundred thousand to the
    usurer, and do not keep it for yourself as a profit or gain… Put it in the bayt

    not right to say that you want to make some changes to it, because it is right and proper

    specific evil.
Secondly, talking about Tawheed and basic matters of aqeedah and
    teaching people about these things among the people you describe, is undoubtedly more
    important. Tawheed is the key to the call of the Messengers (peace be upon them) and the
    first duty of the one who is accountable. It is the condition for all other deeds to be
    accepted. If it is clear to you, or you believe it to be most likely that adhering to some
    mustahabb actions, such as moving your finger etc., may cause confusion or fitnah, or
    cause you trouble, or damage your reputation so that people are put off you and do not

    there is nothing wrong with not doing it for this reason in these circumstances. Allaah

“and We shall make a trial of you with evil and with
    good” [al-Anbiya’ 21:35]
Allâh says (interpretation of the meaning):
“But when He tries him be straitening his means of
    life, he says: ‘My Lord has humiliated me!” [al-Fajr 89:16]
But then Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Nay!”
    [al-Fajr 89:16], meaning, it is not as he thinks; Allaah blesses whoever he wills and
    makes things difficult for whomever He wills, and this is a test, not a sign of honour or
    humiliation. By means of this test, it becomes apparent who is grateful and patient, and
    who is the opposite. And Allaah is the Knower of all things.",this response was written for us by our Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Barraak
