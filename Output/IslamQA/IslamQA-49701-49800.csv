49702,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49702,False report attributed to Zaynab (may Allaah be pleased with her) about healing of disease,"Nowadays there are many messages that come via e-mail, telling of a person who was sick then Sayyidah Zaynab (may Allaah be pleased with her) came to him in a dream, and when he woke up he found that he had been cured of that sickness… Then the sender asks us to send this letter to a number of friends, and warns whoever does not do that of many things, ending with death. How sound is this letter?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    This report that you are asking about is nothing new, but it 
    has become more widely disseminated nowadays because of the ease and speed 
    of communication via e-mail, combined with the ignorance of many who love 
    their religion. 

    There may be some variation in the details of these stories, 
    but they are all based on the same idea and all have the same bad effect on 
    people’s minds. 

    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    warned against them. There follows the text of his statement: 

    A note concerning a false report that is being 
    disseminated by some ignorant people:
, and blessings and peace be upon the 
    slave and Messenger of Allaah, our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his family and 
    companions.   
    
    I have come across a false report that is being disseminated 
    by some ignorant people and people who have little understanding of the 
    religion of Allaah. The text of this report is as follows: 

    “In the name of Allaah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. 
    Blessings and peace be upon the noblest of the Messengers, our Master 
    Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and upon his 
    family and companions.  

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    ‘No doubt! Verily, the Awliya’ [close friends] of Allaah, 
    no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve’

    [Yoonus 10:62]

    Allaah the Almighty has spoken the truth. 

    My Muslim brother, my Muslim sister. 

    A thirteen-year-old girl became very ill and the doctor was 
    unable to treat her. One night her sickness grew worse and she wept until 
    sleep overtook her. In her dream she saw Sayyidah Zaynab (may Allaah be 
    pleased with her). She put some drops in her mouth, and when she woke up 
    from her sleep she was completely healed from her sickness. Sayyidah Zaynab 
    (may Allaah be pleased with her) asked her to write this story thirteen 
    times and distribute it to the Muslims, to demonstrate the power of the 
    Creator, may He be exalted, and how it is manifested in His signs and His 
    creation, exalted be He above all that they associate with Him. The girl did 
    what was asked of her, and this is what happened: 

    1 – The first copy fell into the hands of a poor man, who 
    wrote it out and distributed it. Thirteen days later the Lord willed that 
    this poor man should become rich. 

    2 – The second copy fell into the hands of a worker who 
    ignored it. Thirteen days later he lost his job. 

    3 – The third copy fell into the hands of a rich man who 
    refused to write it out. Thirteen days later he lost all the riches that he 
    possessed. 

    Hasten, O Muslim brother or sister, after reading this story, 
    to copy it out thirteen times and distribute it to people, so that you may 
    get what you wish for from the Most Generous Lord, may He be glorified and 
    exalted. 

    May Allaah send blessings upon our Master Muhammad and upon 
    all his family and companions.” 

    When I read this false report I thought it essential to point 
    out that the benefits and good things that its author claims will come to 
    those who copy it and distribute it, and the bad things that will happen to 
    those who ignore it and do not disseminate it further, are all lies that 
    have no solid basis. Rather they are fabrications of the liars and 
    charlatans who want to divert the Muslims from putting their trust in their 
    Lord alone, with no partner or associate, to bring them benefits and ward 
    off harm from them, as well as taking the permissible means as prescribed in 
    sharee’ah, and who want to make them put their trust in someone or something 
    other than Allaah to bring benefits and ward off harm, and to take false 
    means that are not permitted or prescribed in sharee’ah, which leads them to 
    become attached to something other than Allaah and to worship someone other 
    than Him.  

    Undoubtedly this is one of the plots of the enemies of the 
    Muslims, who want to divert them away from their true religion by any means 
    possible. The Muslims should beware of these plots and not be deceived by 
    them. The Muslim should pay no attention to this false report and similar 
    reports which appear from time to time. Warnings have been issued about 
    several of them in the past. It is not permissible for a Muslim to copy out 
    this and similar reports, or to distribute them under any circumstances. 
    Rather doing that is an evil action and the one who does that is committing 
    a sin; there is the fear that he will be punished in this world and in the 
    Hereafter, because this is a bid’ah (innovation) whose evil is great and 
    whose punishment is severe. 

    This report is a kind of reprehensible innovation, and is one 
    of the means that lead to shirk and exaggeration concerning the Ahl al-Bayt 
    (members of the Prophet’s household) and others among the dead, and calling 
    upon them instead of Allaah and seeking their help and thinking that they 
    can bring benefit to or ward off harm from those who call upon them and seek 
    their help. It is also a kind of telling lies about Allaah. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is only those who 
    believe not in the Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, 
    revelations, etc.) of Allaah, who fabricate falsehood, and it is they who 
    are liars”
[al-Nahl 16:105]

    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “Whoever introduces something into this matter of ours that is 
    not part of it, will have it rejected.” Saheeh – agreed upon. 

    All the Muslims into whose hands this letter falls should 
    tear it up and destroy it, and warn people against it, and not pay any 
    attention to any promises or warnings that it may contain, because these are 
    false reports that have no sound basis and nothing good or bad will result 
    from that. But the one who invented it, those who copy it out and 
    distribute it, and those who promote it and disseminate it among the Muslims 
    are all sinning, because all of that comes under the heading of 
    cooperating in sin and transgression which Allaah has forbidden in His Book, 
    where He says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, 
    righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and 
    transgression. And fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe in punishment”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:2]
 We ask Allaah to keep 
    us and all the Muslims safe and sound from all evil. Allaah is Sufficient 
    for us and He is the best to deal with those who fabricated this report and 
    similar reports, and introduced into the religion of Allaah things that have 
    nothing to do with it. We ask Allaah to deal with them as they deserve, for 
    telling lies about Allaah and disseminating falsehood, and for calling 
    people to the means that lead to shirk and exaggeration about the dead, and 
    distracting them with something that will harm them and will not benefit 
    them. Sincerity towards Allaah and His slaves demands that we point this 
    out. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon His slave and Messenger our 
    Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.

49706,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49706,Can We Take Injections During Fasting?,"One of my friends has been stricken with the onset of cancer and has to take a course of treatment in Ramadan, consisting of a number of medicines dissolved in liquids which are to be administered intravenously. Is his fasting valid?",If the injection provides nourishment that takes the place of food and drink; it breaks the fast because it is like eating and drinking. If the injection is not a kind of nourishment; this does not break the fast.,,"Praise be to Allah.Two scenarios may apply to having injections during the day in Ramadan : 

Where the injection provides nourishment that takes the place of food and drink; this kind of injection invalidates the fast because it is like eating and drinking. 
Where what is injected is not a kind of nourishment; this does not break the fast or affect it. In this case, it makes no difference whether the injection is into a vein or a muscle. 

But if it is possible to have these injections at night, that is better and more on the safe side with regard to the fast. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (15/257) was asked about the ruling on a person who had intravenous and intramuscular injections during the day in Ramadan when he was fasting and completed his fast – was his fast invalidated and does he have to make it up, or not? 
He replied: 
“His fast is valid, because an injection into a vein is not like eating or drinking; this applies more so in the case of an intramuscular injection. But if he makes it up in order to be on the safe side, that is better. If it can be delayed until nighttime, if he needs to have it,that is better too, so as to avoid an area of scholarly dispute.” 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin was asked in Fatawa al-Siyam (p. 220) about the ruling on having injections into a vein, muscle or the buttock. 
He replied: 
“There is nothing wrong with having injections into a vein , muscle or buttock, and that does not break the fast, because this is not one of the things that breaks the fast; it is not food or drink, and it is not like eating or drinking. We have already explained that this does not have any effect on the fast. What does affect the fast is when a sick person is given an injection of something that takes the place of food and drink.” 
The Standing Committee (10/252) was asked about the ruling on administering medicine via injection during the day in Ramadan, whether that is nourishment or medication. 
They replied: 
“It is permissible to administer medicine by needle into a muscle or vein to a fasting person during the day in Ramadan, but it is not permissible for the fasting person to be given a nourishing injection during the day in Ramadan, because that comes under the ruling on eating or drinking, so that injection is regarded as a means of breaking the fast in Ramadan. If the injection can be given into a muscle or vein at night,that is better.”

49707,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49707,He wants to marry her but she does not wear niqaab. Should he go ahead and propose or should he look for someone else?,"I am a young Arab man who lives according to our Arab traditions, or what is known as a good attitude and etiquette, but this commitment has nothing to do with adhering to Islamic teachings, because in our country adhering to tradition does not contradict listening to music, mixing, dealing with riba-based banks and so on. I proposed marriage to a girl in the same environment that I am living in, and her family have been friends of my family for a long time. They all approved of the marriage since they know that we are both of good character. But my problem, unfortunately, started when I began to read about the rules on marriage in Islam and I started to reduce mixing and to pray regularly in the mosque and let my beard grow and not deal with riba-based banks and not listen to music and so on. Now both families are regarding me as an extremist, except those on whom Allaah has mercy, and they started to make this girl afraid of me, even though she loves me very much and has told them all about that many times. The girl wants to be committed but she is not able to do some things such as wearing niqaab or covering the face. So she too regards these things as signs of extremism in religion, as her family do. 
Should I forget about this girl who is of good character and proper etiquette and who is keen to pray and recite the adhkaar of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and is trying to be committed, and who loves me and tells others of that, and does not want to lose me, but she is unable to do some things that have to do with religion, such as covering her face, and look for someone else who is committed but whose family and behaviour I do not know and my judgement of her will be only according to what I hear from those who know her family and behaviour?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We ask Allaah the Almighty to make us and you steadfast in adhering to His religion, and to bless us and you with more obedience and righteousness. 
With regard to what you are asking about, it is better for you to stay with this girl towards whom your heart is inclined, and who feels likewise about you, and who has no faults that would cause you to leave her. All that there is, is that she needs a little care and encouragement and sound Islamic education to accept and follow the commands of Allaah. 
A lot of that may come after marriage, especially if you treat her nicely and move her into a better environment than the one she is in, which is what we advise and encourage you to do.  
There is no reason why a woman who loves her religion and is obedient to her husband should not respond to the command of Allaah as regards her clothing, especially since this will make her husband love and respect her more. 
Her refusal to wear niqaab may be because of the lies fabricated by some of those who are ignorant and who follow their own whims and desires, who say that the niqaab is a custom inherited from the Jaahiliyyah and that it was not brought by Islam. You should explain to her the ruling on a woman covering her face, with evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and tell her that the scholars are unanimously agreed that this ruling is prescribed in Islam. 
Remind her of the Sahaabi women who hastened to tear their aprons so that they could cover their faces after the verse of hijab was revealed, and encourage her to have righteous friends. Tell her that this world is transient and soon each of us will meet our Lord with our deeds. 
Neither you nor she should worry about what your families will say. As for such environments where the rulings of Islam are not known and people cannot differentiate between proper adherence to Islam and extremism no attention should be paid to them or to what they say about one who adheres to the path of righteousness. 
If your wife does not respond to the Islamic injunction to cover the face, then be patient with her, and try to convey the message to her in some other way, such as from another women who is involved in da’wah, or by means of tapes and books by scholars whose knowledge and religious commitment can be trusted. 
Seek the help of Allaah and persist in calling upon Him, asking Him for support and help to establish a household based on what our Lord loves and is pleased with.

49708,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49708,His wife and her family accused him of having something wrong with his mind; should he take a second wife?,"I am 24 years old and I got married a year ago. My marriage lasted only 6 months, after which my wife’s family accused me of being mentally ill. I proved that this was not the case with the help of a government psychiatrist. This is happening to me because my wife’s family is accusing me and she is agreeing with them, may Allaah forgive her. What should I do? Should I take another wife? Please note that the problem with my wife has been referred to the court and divorce proceedings are under way. If I get married [to a second wife] now, will there be any sin on me?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Proof that a person is in good mental health and treats 
    others well does not require the testimony of a doctor. What matters is what 
    people see of a man, not the papers he produces.  

    Hence if the accusations of your wife’s family are based on 
    things that they have seen you do or words that they have heard you speak, 
    then they may have a reason. You have to sort yourself out and mend your 
    ways so that there will be nothing for others to judge you by.  

    If what they said about you has no real basis, rather it is 
    false and sinful testimony, then we think that you should advise them and 
    explain to them that their false accusation against you is sinful, and tell 
    them how that has caused division between you and your wife. If they recant, 
    then all well and good, otherwise you should shun them, and not let them 
    visit you or let your wife visit them, lest they turn her against you. 

    With regard to your intention of taking a second wife, what 
    we advise you is to wait and to examine the real motive for that, because 
    often in such cases the decision is based on the desire for revenge against 
    the first wife and her family because of the trouble they caused, and 
    usually when a man marries with this attitude it leads to trouble for the 
    second wife too, if the husband has not set things straight with his first 
    wife and her family. 

    If you have not set things straight between you and your wife 
    and her family, we think that if you want to take a second wife, you should 
    let the first wife go and divorce her, or you can keep the first wife if you 
    intend to keep both wives if Allaah guides her (the first wife). We also 
    advise you to have a good intention and try to do the right thing, for 
    Allaah says concerning spouses between whom there are difficulties 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “if they both wish for peace, Allaah will cause their 
    reconciliation. Indeed Allaah is Ever All‑Knower, Well‑Acquainted with all 
    things”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:35]
We advise you to fear 
    Allaah with regard to every step you take and not to let this problem cause 
    you to treat her unjustly or to keep reminding her of mistakes that she made 
    but that she has apologized for.

     We ask Allaah to set your affairs straight and to make it easy for both of you to do the right thing. And Allaah is the Source of strength.",Islam Q&A

There is the donation of organs on which life depends, and there is the donation of organs on which life does not depend. 
If the donation is of an organ on which life depends, such as the heart or liver, it is not permissible to donate it, according to the consensus of the scholars, because that is killing a soul. 
But if it is an organ on which life does not depend, such as a kidney or blood vessels, then there is a difference of opinion among contemporary scholars, and there are two views on this matter: 
1 – That it is permissible to transplant human organs
2 – That it is not permissible to transplant human organs 
Fatwas stating that it is permissible have been issued by a number of conferences, seminars and committees, including: the International Islamic Conference held in Malaysia; the majority of the Islamic Fiqh Council, whose fatwa may be seen in the answer to question no. 2117; the Council of Senior Scholars in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; and the Fatwa Committees in Jordan, Kuwait, Egypt and Algeria. 
It is also the view of a number of scholars and researchers, including Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Sa’di. 
Some of the scholars favoured the view that transplants are permissible on condition that the donor is a harbi kaafir (i.e., one who is in a state of war against Islam, not one with whom the Muslims have a treaty, or who is living under Muslim protection), because the harbi kaafir has no sanctity, whereas the sanctity of the Muslim is established in life and in death.

If he cannot, then it is sufficient for him to have the intention of breaking the fast.","The Sunnah is to hasten to break the fast 


The Sunnah is to break the fast with fresh dates 


Can doctors delay iftar?","Praise be to Allah.The Sunnah is to hasten to break the fast 
The Sunnah is to hasten to break the fast as soon as the sun goes down. There are several hadiths from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning that, such as the following: 
Al-Bukhari (1975) and Muslim (1098) narrated from Sahl ibn Sa’d that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The people will continue to do well so long as they hasten to break the fast.” 
Al-Nawawi said: 
“In this hadith, we are urged to hasten to break the fast , after checking that the sun has indeed set. What this means is that the ummah will continue to be in good shape and will be fine, so long as they adhere to this Sunnah. If they delay (breaking the fast) then this will be a sign of corruption that they have fallen into.”
Al-Hafiz said: 
Al-Muhallab said: 
“The reason behind that is so as to avoid making the day longer by taking from the night. It is also kinder to the fasting person and gives him more strength for worship. The scholars agree that this hadith refers to when it is confirmed that the sun has indeed set by visual sighting or by the testimony of two witnesses of good character – or of one such witness according to the more correct view.”
Another reason for that: “Is so as to hasten to eat that which Allah has permitted, for Allah is Most Generous, and one who is generous likes to see people hasten to enjoy his generosity. So He likes His slaves to hasten to enjoy that which Allah has permitted to them as soon as the sun sets.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/268) 
This hadith is also a refutation of the Shi’ah who delay breaking the fast until the stars appear. This was the view of Ibn Daqiq al-’Eid. 
The Sunnah is to break the fast with fresh dates 
The Sunnah is for the fasting person to break the fast with fresh dates ; if he cannot find any then with dried dates; if he cannot find any then with water. If he cannot find any then he should break the fast with whatever food and drink are available. 
If the fasting person cannot find anything with which to break his fast, he should break his fast in intention, i.e., he should declare that his fast is over even if that is delayed, thus he will have hastened to break the fast and followed the Sunnah in that.  
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (6/269): 
“If he cannot find water or any other drink, or any food, he should intend in his heart to break his fast, and that is sufficient.”
Can doctors delay iftar? 
Based on this, if this doctor cannot break his fast with fresh or dried dates, then he can break his fast with water. If he cannot do that because he is so busy doing the operation , then it is sufficient for him to have the intention of breaking the fast, and he can act in accordance with the Sunnah in this way.

49719,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49719,Their father is senile and divorced their mother – did divorce really take place? And should they put him in a home for the elderly?,"My father is bedridden and very sick; sometimes he does not know what he is saying, and at other times we find that he is very focused and can calculate money. He often insults religion and has weak eyesight and cannot hear at all. Often he urinates in the bed then throws his urine on the floor, then when we come and ask him, sometimes he denies it and sometimes he does it to annoy us and force us to wipe it up. One time my mother did wudoo’ then he called her, so she went to him, and he threw urine at her. She told him off and he said: “I am going to divorce you.” A little while later he said, “You are divorced.” What about this divorce? How should we deal with this father who is now in a very bad state and we cannot bear it. Can we put him in a home for the elderly?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It seems from what your father is doing that he has reached 
    the stage of senility, at which the obligations of sharee’ah are waived, so 
    he is not expected to pray or fast, and any vows, oaths or words of divorce 
    spoken by him are invalid. 

    If you can be patient and put up with the things he does, 
    then you should do that. If you cannot bear it, then there is nothing wrong 
    with you taking him to a home that takes care of the elderly, on condition 
    that you carry on honouring him and visiting him, and meeting his physical 
    and emotional needs as much as you can. 

    You should note that Allaah has enjoined honouring parents, 
    especially when they reach old age, because of their great need at that 
    time. Allaah has forbidden mistreating parents in word or deed, even by 
    saying “Uff” (a mild expression of displeasure). 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And your Lord has 
    decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your 
    parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not 
    to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of 
    honour
And lower unto them the 
    wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say: ‘My Lord! Bestow on 
    them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was young.’”

    [al-Isra’ 17:23]

    Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di said: 

    Then after mentioning His rights, Allaah mentions the rights 
    of parents and says, “And that you be dutiful to your parents” i.e., 
    you should treat them kindly in all ways, in word and deed, because they are 
    the reason why a person exists and because they love their child and treat 
    him kindly, which confirms that the child in turn is obliged to treat them 
    kindly.  

    “If one of them or both of them attain old age in your 
    life” means, if they reach the age at which they grow weak and need 
    kindness and good treatment, “say not to them a word of disrespect”: 
    the word “uff” is the least kind of offensive speech, and what is meant is 
    do not mistreat them in the slightest. 

    “Nor shout at them” means, do not rebuke them or speak 
    to them in a disrespectful manner. “But address them in terms of honour” 
    means, in a polite, gentle and kind manner, which will soften their hearts 
    and give them peace of mind. That varies according to circumstances, customs 
    and times. 

    “And lower unto them the wing of submission and humility 
    through mercy” means, be humble towards them and compassionate, seeking 
    reward thereby, not because you are afraid of them or hope for what they 
    have and other motives for which a person will not be rewarded. 

    “And say: ‘My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy” means: 
    pray for Allaah’s mercy for them during their lifetime and after they have 
    died, in return for their having brought you up when you were young. 

    From this it may be understood that the more time spent in

49721,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49721,Semen coming out during the day following intercourse at night – does this invalidate the fast?,"After intercourse at night, some semen may come out of the vagina during the day. Does this invalidate the fast? Is it necessary to do ghusl in order to pray?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Firstly, if semen comes out during the day after 
      intercourse at night, that does not invalidate the fast. We have been 
      permitted to eat, drink and have intercourse from sunset until dawn comes. 
      Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is made lawful 
    for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of As‑Sawm 
    (the fasts). They are Libaas [i.e. body-cover, or screen, or Sakan (i.e. you 
    enjoy the pleasure of living with them)] for you and you are the same for 
    them. Allaah knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He turned to you 
    (accepted your repentance) and forgave you. So now have sexual relations 
    with them and seek that which Allaah has ordained for you (offspring), and 
    eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct 
    from the black thread (darkness of night)…”

    [al-Baqarah 2:187]
The scholars (may Allaah 
    have mercy on them) have stated that if semen comes out during the day after 
    having had intercourse at night, that does not invalidate the fast. 

    It says in al-Jawharah al-Nayyirah (1/138), which is a 
    Hanafi book: 

    If a person who is having intercourse fears that dawn will 
    come so he withdraws, then he emits semen after dawn, that does not break 
    his fast. End quote. 

    And it says in Haashiyat al-Dasooqi (1/523), which is 
    a Maaliki book: 

    If a person has intercourse at night and his semen is emitted 
    after dawn, it seems that he does not have to do anything, as is also the 
    case for one who puts on kohl at night then it reaches his throat during the 
    day. End quote. It says something similar in Sharh Mukhtasar Khaleel, 
    2/249. 

    Al-Nawawi, whose madhhab was Shaafa’i, said in al-Majmoo’ 
    (6/348): 
If a person has 
    intercourse before dawn then he withdraws when dawn comes or straight after 
    it comes, then ejaculates, that does not invalidate his fast, because it 
    came as the result of permissible intimacy, so he does not have to do 
    anything. The same applies if a man’s hand is cut off in a case of hadd 
    punishment and he dies as a result (i.e., no one is responsible for his 
    death). End quote. 

    Secondly: 

    If a person has intercourse then does ghusl, then some semen 
    comes out of him after doing ghusl, he does not have to do ghusl again, 
    because the reason for that is one reason, so there is no need to do two 
    ghusls. Rather he has to do ghusl if he ejaculates again as the result of 
    renewed desire.

We are going to carry out an artificial insemination procedure, but the appointment for this procedure will be in the blessed month of Ramadan. This is because of the ovulation cycle.

Will Allah forgive us because we have to do this, and is there any expiation?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly:  
Artificial insemination involves many things that are wrong. It has been proven that some doctors deliberately switch the sperm, either because they are evil themselves, or because they are certain that the man’s sperm is not fit for fertilization, and their greed for money leads them to do this. 
It has been proven that in many hospitals mistakes have been made and samples have been switched. Hence the scholars’ view on this matter is strict and they have stated that it is not permissible if the samples are stored and inserted into the woman’s uterus at a later date. Others have said that it is not allowed at all, because of the inherent dangers of error in this method which may lead to mingling of lineages and many other evils. 
Secondly: 
This insemination is not a case of necessity whereby a man and his wife may break their fast. It can be delayed until night or until after Ramadan. 
What we advise you to do is to be patient and accept the decree of Allah, and to apply the shar’i means of producing offspring. If you insist on artificial insemination then you have to take the strictest precautions to keep an eye on the sample and ensure that it is inserted immediately in your wife’s uterus by a female doctor whose religious commitment is trustworthy.

Night lasts from when the sun first sets until (true) dawn comes. It is haram to have intercourse with your wife during the day in Ramadan and it is one of the things that invalidates the fast.,"Types of intercourse in Ramadan 


Intercourse at night in Ramadan


Intercourse during the day in Ramadan




Expiation for having intercourse during the day in Ramadan","Praise be to Allah.Types of intercourse in Ramadan 
Intercourse with one's wife in Ramadan may mean one of two things, either at night or during the day.
Intercourse at night in Ramadan
Intercourse at night is permissible. Night lasts from when the sun first sets until dawn comes. 
The ruling at the beginning of Islam was that intercourse was permissible during the nights of Ramadan so long as one had not yet gone to sleep. If a person went to sleep it became haram for him to have intercourse after that, even if he woke up before dawn came. Then Allah made the ruling easier and allowed intercourse at any time during the night in Ramadan. This is indicated by the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of As-Sawm (the fasts). They are Libas [i.e. body-cover, or screen, or Sakan (i.e. you enjoy the pleasure of living with them)] for you and you are the same for them. Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He turned to you (accepted your repentance) and forgave you. So now have sexual relations with them and seek that which Allah has ordained for you (offspring), and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your Sawm (fast) till the nightfall.” [al-Baqarah 2:187]
Al-Sa’di (p. 87) said: 
“When the fast was first enjoined, it was haram for the Muslims to eat, drink or have intercourse at night after having slept, but that caused hardship for some of them, so Allah made it easier for them and allowed them to eat, drink and have intercourse at any time during the nights of the fast, whether they had slept or not, because they were deceiving themselves. 
“so He turned to you” means that He made something easier for you that would have caused you to fall into sin otherwise; “and forgave you” for what is past. “So now” means, after this concession and ease that has been granted by Allaah, “have sexual relations with them” means intercourse, kissing, touching, etc. 
“and seek that which Allah has ordained for you” means intend, when you have relations with your wives, to obey Allah thereby and to achieve the greater purpose of intercourse, which is to have children, keep oneself and one’s wife chaste, and to achieve the purposes of marriage.” 
Al-Jassas said in Ahkam al-Quran (1/265): 
“Intercourse, eating and drinking are permitted during the nights of the fast from the beginning (of the night) until dawn comes.” 
Al-Bukhari (4508) narrated from al-Bara (may Allah be pleased with him) that when the obligation of fasting was first revealed, they would not come near to their wives for the whole of Ramadan, and some men deceived themselves, then Allah revealed “Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He turned to you (accepted your repentance) and forgave you”. 
Al-Hafiz said:
“With regard to the phrase, “when the obligation of fasting was first revealed, they would not come near to their wives for the whole of Ramadan” – it appears from the context of this report that intercourse was forbidden both night and day, unlike eating and drinking which were allowed at night so long as one had not slept. But the rest of the hadiths narrated on this topic indicate that no such distinction was made, so the words “they would not come near to their wives” may be understood as referring to what most of the people did, so as to reconcile between the reports.” 
“You used to deceive yourselves” means that they had intercourse with their wives and ate and drank at the time when it was forbidden to them. This was mentioned by al-Tabari. And it was narrated from Mujahid that “you used to deceive yourselves” means that they wronged themselves.” (‘Awn al-Ma’bud) 
Intercourse during the day in Ramadan
With regard to intercourse during the day in Ramadan on the part of one who is obliged to fast, the scholars agree that it is haram and is one of the things that invalidate the fast. 
It says in al-Mughni (4/372): 
“We do not know of any differing opinion among the scholars with regard to the fact that whoever has intercourse in the vagina, whether he ejaculates or not, or ejaculates outside the vagina, has broken his fast if he did that deliberately. This is indicated by the sahih reports.”  
Expiation for having intercourse during the day in Ramadan 
Indeed intercourse is the most serious of the things that break the fast, and expiation must be offered for that . 
Al-Bukhari (2600) and Muslim (111) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of Allah, I am doomed!” He said: “Why is that?” He said, “I had intercourse with my wife when I was fasting.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you have a slave whom you can set free?” He said, “No.” He said: “Can you fast for two consecutive months?” He said, “No.” He said, “Can you afford to feed sixty poor persons?” He said, “No.” Then a man from among the Ansar brought a basket of dates. He said: ‘Take this and give it in charity.” The man said: “To someone poorer than us? O Messenger of Allah, by the One Who sent you with the truth, there is no family between the two lava fields (i.e., in Madinah) poorer than us.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Go and feed it to your family.”

Is my fast invalidated?","Emission of madhiy does not break the fast according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions whether that is because of kissing one's wife, watching movies, or other things that provoke desire.","Difference between maniy and madhiy


Does madhiy break fast?


Avoid speaking to women unnecessarily","Praise be to Allah.Difference between maniy and madhiy
This questioner is uncertain as to whether it is maniy (semen) or madhiy (prostatic fluid). 
“The difference between maniy and madhiy is that the maniy that comes from a man is thick and white, and that which comes from a woman [fluid emitted at the moment of climax] is thin and yellow. Madhiy is thin and white and sticky and comes out during foreplay, or when thinking about intercourse, or wanting it, or when looking, etc. It is experienced by both men and women.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 5/418) 
It seems most likely that what is coming out of you is madhiy and not maniy, because maniy comes out gushing and a man can feel it. 
Causing the emission of maniy is one of the things that invalidates the fast , if that happens as a result of intercourse or touching, or repeatedly looking at women, then the fast is invalidated.
Does madhiy break fast?
With regard to madhiy, the scholars differed as to whether it invalidates the fast if a person causes it to be emitted. 
The view of the Hanbalis is that madhiy does invalidate the fast if it is caused by direct physical contact, such as touching, kissing, etc. But if the cause is repeatedly looking, then it does not invalidate the fast. 
Abu Hanifah and al-Shafi`i are of the view that emission of madhiy does not invalidate the fast in any case, whether it is caused by direct physical contact or otherwise, and that what invalidates the fast is emission of maniy, not madhiy. (See al-Mughni, 4/363) 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (6/236), after quoting the view of the Hanbalis on this issue: 
“There is no sound evidence to support that, because madhiy is of a lesser status than maniy with regard to desire, and does not cause a person to be tired after emitting it, so it cannot be likened to it.  
The correct view is that if a person has direct physical contact and emits madhiy, or masturbates and emits madhiy, this does not invalidate the fast, and his fast is still valid.  This is the view favoured by Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him). The proof for this is the fact that there is no proof to support the view that emission of madhiy invalidates the fast, because this fast is an act of worship that the person started as prescribed in Shari`ah and it cannot be regarded as having been invalidated unless there is evidence to that effect.” 
What is meant by “[he] masturbates and emits madhiy” is that he tried to ejaculate by means of masturbation but he did not, rather what came out was madhiy. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (15/267) was asked: if a man kisses [his wife] when he is fasting, or watches some indecent movies and some madhiy comes out of him, should he make up that fast? 
He replied: 
“Emission of madhiy does not invalidate the fast according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, whether that is because of kissing one's wife, watching movies, or other things that provoke desire. But it is not permissible for a Muslim to watch these indecent movies or to listen to music and songs that Allah has forbidden. If maniy (semen) is emitted as the result of desire, then this invalidates the fast whether that happened as the result of touching, kissing, repeatedly looking or any other thing that provokes desire, such as masturbation etc. But wet dreams and thinking do not invalidate the fast, even if maniy is emitted as a result. “
The Standing Committee (10/273) was asked: One day in Ramadan I was sitting beside my wife for about half an hour and we were fasting. We were joking and after I moved away from her I noticed a wet spot on my pants that had come from my private part. And that happened a second time. I hope you can advise me whether I have to offer any expiation. 
They replied: 
“If the situation is as you described, then you do not have to make up that day or offer any expiation, on the assumption that your fast remained valid, unless it is proven that that wetness is maniy (semen), in which case you have to do ghusl and make up that day, but you do not have to offer expiation.” 
The point is that you do not have to do anything and your fast is valid, unless you are certain that what came out of you is maniy. If it is maniy, then you have to make up for that day but you do not have to offer any expiation. 
Avoid speaking to women unnecessarily
You should avoid speaking to women unnecessarily, and if you need to speak to them then you should lower your gaze, in obedience to the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts). That is purer for them. Verily, Allah is All-Aware of what they do.” [al-Nur 24:30]
Muslim (2159) narrated that Jarir ibn ‘Abd-Allah said: I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about an accidental glance and he told me to look away. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
“What is meant by an accidental or sudden glance is when one’s gaze falls upon a non-mahram woman unintentionally. There is no sin on a person in the beginning, but he has to look away immediately. If he looks away immediately then there is no sin on him, but if he continues to look, then he commits a sin, because of this hadith. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined looking away, as well as the verse, “Tell the believing men to lower their gaze”.” 
If it is possible for a woman to take care of selling to women and speaking to them, that is better and safer.

Death in Ramadan: Any Virtues?","Praise be to Allah.Entering Paradise without being brought to account 
Allah has blessed some of the elite among His slaves with the promise that they will enter Paradise without being brought to account and without being punished. 
 ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The nations were shown to me and I saw a prophet with a small band of followers, and a prophet with one or two men with him, and a prophet who had no one with him. Then I was shown a huge multitude and I thought they were my ummah, but it was said to me: This is Musa (peace be upon him) and his people. But look at the horizon. So I looked and saw a huge multitude, and it was said to me: Look at the other horizon, and there was (another) huge multitude. And it was said to me: This is your ummah and with them are seventy thousand who will enter Paradise without being brought to account or punished.” Then he got up and went into his house, and the people disputed about those who enter Paradise without being brought to account or being punished. Some of them said: Perhaps they are the ones who accompanied the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Some of them said: Perhaps they are the ones who were born in Islam and did not associate anything with Allah. And they mentioned other things. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came out to them and said: “What are you disputing about?” They told him, and he said: “They are the ones who did not seek ruqyah or believe in bird omens, and they put their trust in their Lord.” ‘Ukashah ibn Mihsan stood up and said: Pray to Allah to make me one of them. He said: “You will be one of them.” Another man stood up and said: Pray to Allah to make me one of them. He said: “ ‘Ukashah has beaten you to it.” (Al-Bukhari, 5705; Muslim, 220)
He did not say that among these seventy thousand would be those who died during the month of Ramadan . Rather those who are mentioned are the elite of the believers who achieved true belief in the oneness of the Lord of the Worlds (Tawhid). 
It says in Fath al-Majid: 
“The phrase “and put their trust in their Lord'' points to the basic principles from which these actions and attributes stemmed, which is putting one's trust in Allah (tawakkul) and sincerely turning to Him and depending on Him. This is the ultimate Tawhid which raises a person to a high status of love, hope, fear and being content with Allah as one's Lord and God, and being content with His decree.” (p. 74) 
Death in Ramadan: Any Virtues?
Concerning the virtue of one who dies whilst fasting, it was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever says La ilaha illa-Allah (there is no god but Allah), seeking the Face of Allah and that was his final action, will enter Paradise. Whoever fasts one day seeking the Face of Allah and that was his final action, will enter Paradise. Whoever gives charity seeking the Face of Allah and that was his final action will enter Paradise.” Narrated by Imam Ahmad, 22813, from the hadith of Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him). Al-Albani said in Ahkam al-Janaiz: its isnad is sahih. 
It should be noted that the previous hadith points to the high status of those seventy thousand (may Allah make us among them) with regard to doing righteous deeds, which is what brought them to that status before Allah. Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after quoting this hadith in Kitab al-Tawhid: “This is indicative of the depth of the knowledge of the salaf, because they knew that they could not attain that status except by doing righteous deeds.” It should be obvious to the questioner that if there were anything special about dying in Ramadan, this would apply only to the believers and not all those who die in Ramadan. 
Similarly, with regard to the hadith quoted above concerning the virtue of one who dies whilst fasting, which says that he will enter Paradise, this promise is for one who does righteous deeds and that was his final deed, not simply for dying in Ramadan. Moreover, it does not mention that specific virtue of entering Paradise without being brought to account. And Allah is the Source of strength.

But if she cannot fast and there is no hope that she will be able to do so in the future because of sickness or old age, then she does not have to fast, but she has to feed one poor person for each day. 
The evidence for that is the report narrated by Abu Dawood (2318) from Ibn ‘Abbaas concerning the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskeen (poor person) (for every day)” [Al-Baqarah 2:184]

He replied: 
She has to feed one poor person for each day, giving half a saa’ of the local staple food, whether it is dates, rice or something else. This is equivalent to approximately one and a half kilograms. This was the fatwa of a number of the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), including Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him). If she is poor and cannot feed others then she does not have to do anything.

49791,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49791,"Drinking from Zamzam is mustahabb, not obligatory","I intend, if Allaah wills, to do ‘Umrah during the blessed month of Ramadaan. I am supposed to reach Makkah by land at noontime. It is well known that the pilgrim doing ‘umrah has to drink some Zamzam water after praying behind Maqaam Ibraaheem on ordinary days, but in Ramadaan I intend to fast and not break my fast. So how can I drink Zamzam water?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    Drinking Zamzam water is not obligatory, rather it is 
    mustahabb, but it is not mustahabb only after praying the two rak’ahs behind 
    the Maqaam, rather drinking from Zamzam is mustahabb at all times. 

    Shaykh al-Islam said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (16/144): 
It is mustahabb to drink 
    Zamzam water and to drink one’s fill of it, and to make whatever Islamically 
    prescribed du’aa’s one wants when drinking it. 

    Al-Muwaffaq said in al-Mughni: 
It is mustahabb to come 
    to Zamzam and drink from its water for the one who wants to, and to drink 
    one's fill of it. Jaabir said, describing the Hajj of the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Then he came to Banu ‘Abd 
    al-Muttalib, who were providing water, and they gave him a bucket, and he 
    drank from it.” 

    Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’: 
Al-Shaafa’i, his 
    companions and others said: it is mustahabb to drink Zamzam water, and to 
    drink a great deal of it, and to drink one's fill. It is mustahabb to drink 
    it for whatever benefits one wants in this world and the Hereafter. If a 
    person wants to drink it for forgiveness or healing from sickness etc, he 
    should face the qiblah and mention the name of Allaah, then say, “O Allaah, 
    I heard that Your Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: ‘The water of Zamzam is for whatever it is drunk for.’ O Allaah, I am 
    drinking it so that You will forgive me so forgive me, O Allaah,” or: “I am 
    drinking it to seek healing from sickness, so heal me, O Allaah.” And so on. 
    It is mustahabb to drink in three draughts as in the case of any other 
    drink. And when he is done he should praise Allaah. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (16/138): 

    It is mustahabb for the pilgrim doing Hajj or ‘umrah to drink 
    from the water of Zamzam if he is able to do so. 

    Based on this, if you do ‘umrah when you are fasting, there 
    is no sin on you if you do not drink from Zamzam, and you can drink from it 
    after you break your fast. 

    Secondly: 

    If you are traveling to Makkah for ‘umrah, it is permissible 
    for a traveler either to break his fast or to fast, according to scholarly 
    consensus, but they differed as to which is better. We have already 
    mentioned in the answer to question no. 
    20165 that what is better is what is 
    easier. For those for whom fasting when traveling is not too difficult, then 
    fasting is better, and for those for whom fasting is too difficult whilst 
    traveling, not fasting is better, especially for one who is doing ‘umrah, 
    because he needs physical strength in order to do ‘umrah properly, with 
    du’aa’ and proper focus and humility. 

    Some people who do ‘umrah make it difficult for themselves by 
    doing ‘umrah whilst fasting, even though fasting is very difficult for them, 
    which affects the way they do ‘umrah. It was proven that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to break his fast on the 
    Day of ‘Arafah. 

    Al-Shawkaani said: 

    Fasting the day of ‘Arafah is mustahabb for everyone, but it 
    is makrooh for those who are in ‘Arafah for Hajj. The reason for that is 
    that it may lead to the pilgrim becoming too weak to offer du’aa’ and 
    remember Allaah (dhikr) on the Day of ‘Arafaah in that place and to do the 
    actions of Hajj. 

    It was proven in al-Saheehayn that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade singling out Friday for 
    fasting. 

    Al-Nawawi said: 
It is makrooh to single 
    out Friday for fasting unless that coincides with one’s habit [e.g. fasting 
    alternate days], but if a person fasts the day after or the day before as 
    well, or it coincides with his habits, such as if he vowed to fast the day 
    when he was healed forever, and that happens to be a Friday, then it is not 
    makrooh. 

    The scholars said: The reason why it is forbidden is that 
    Friday is a day of du’aa’, dhikr and worship, such as doing ghusl, going to 
    the prayer early and waiting for the prayer, listening to the khutbah and 
    doing a lot of dhikr afterwards. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“Then when the (Jumu‘ah) 
    Salaah (prayer) is ended, you may disperse through the land, and seek the 
    Bounty of Allaah (by working), and remember Allaah much”

    [al-Jumu’ah 62:10]

    And there are other acts of worship to be done on this day, 
    so it is mustahabb not to fast on Friday, because that helps one to do these 
    duties in an energetic manner and to enjoy them without getting tired or 
    bored. This is similar to the situation of the pilgrim on the Day of ‘Arafah 
    in ‘Arafah – the Sunnah is for him not to fast as stated above, for the same 
    reason. If some one were to say: if a person fasts another day as Friday 
    that will still make him tired and affect his worship. The answer is that by 
    fasting an extra day he will gain reward that will make up for any 
    shortcomings in his worship on Friday. This is the reason why it is 
    prohibited to single out Friday for fasting. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked in Fataawa Arkaan al-Islam 
    (p. 464) about a traveler who reaches Makkah fasting: should he break his 
    fast in order to have more strength to do ‘umrah? 

    We say: when the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) entered Makkah on the twentieth of Ramadaan in the year of the 
    Conquest, he broke his fast. 

    It is proven in Saheeh al-Bukhaari that the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not fast for the rest 
    of the month, because he was traveling. The journey of the pilgrim doing 
    ‘umrah does not end when he reaches Makkah, and he does not have to refrain 
    from eating etc if he comes not fasting. Some people may continue to fast 
    even when traveling, because fasting whilst traveling nowadays is not a 
    hardship for the ummah, so they continue to fast whilst traveling then come 
    to Makkah feeling very tired, and they wonder whether they should continue 
    their fast or not, or should they delay ‘umrah until after they have broken 
    the fast, or break the fast in order to do ‘umrah straight after reaching 
    Makkah?

    We say to them in this case: it is better for you to break 
    your fast in order to do ‘umrah as soon as you reach Makkah, when you are 
    still feeling energetic, because the Sunnah is for the one who comes to 
    Makkah for pilgrimage to hasten straight away to do these rituals. When the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) entered Makkah for 
    the purpose of pilgrimage he would hasten to the mosque, and he used to make 
    his camel stop at the mosque and go in to do his rituals that he had come to 
    do. Not fasting so that you will be able to do ‘umrah in an energetic manner 
    during the day is better than continuing to fast and then doing ‘umrah after 
    you break your fast at night. It was proven that the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) was fasting when he was traveling to 
    conquer Makkah, then the people came to him and said: “O Messenger of 
    Allaah, fasting is proving too hard for the people, and they are waiting to 
    see what you will do.” And that was after ‘Asr. So the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked for a drink of water and drank it 
    whilst the people were looking on. So he broke his fast whilst traveling, 
    and he even broke his fast towards the end of the day, all in order to show 
    his ummah that that is permissible. Making oneself fast whilst traveling 
    even though it is too difficult is undoubtedly contrary to the Sunnah, and 
    the following words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) apply in this case: “It is not righteousness to fast whilst 
    traveling.” 

    If your fasting whilst traveling will affect your performance of ‘umrah, then it is better for you to break your fast and make that day up later on.",Islam Q&A
49793,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49793,How Much Is Zakat al-Fitr?,We are members of a North African group living in Barcelona. How can we work out how much zakat al-fitr is?,"Prophet Muhammad enjoined zakat al-fitr on the Muslims, one sa’ of dates or one sa’ of barley, and he commanded that it be given before the people went out to the ‘Eid prayer.","How much is zakat al-fitr?


Who should give zakat al-fitr?


When should zakat al-fitr be paid?


To whom should zakat al-fitr be given?


Can zakat al-fitr be paid in cash?","Praise be to Allah.How much is zakat al-fitr?
“It was proven from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that he enjoined zakat al-fitr on the Muslims, one sa’ of dates or one sa’ of barley, and he commanded that it be given before the people went out to the (‘Eid) prayer. 
In al-Sahihayn, it is narrated that Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: At the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) we used to give one sa’ of food, or one sa’ of dates, or one sa’ of barley, or one sa’ of raisins. 
Some of the scholars have interpreted “food” (ta’am) in this hadith as referring to wheat; others interpreted it as meaning the staple food of the country, whatever it is, whether it is wheat, corn, pearl millet or whatever. This is the correct view, because zakah is a help from the rich to the poor, and the Muslim does not have to help with anything other than the staple food of his country. 
Undoubtedly rice is the staple food in the land of the Two Holy Sanctuaries (Saudi Arabia) and it is a good and valuable food; it is better than the barley that is mentioned in the text. Hence it is known that there is nothing wrong with giving rice as zakat al-fitr. 
What must be given is a sa’ of any kind of staple food, i.e., a sa’ of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), which is four complete scoops as scooped up with two hands, according to al-Qamus etc. 
In modern weights, this is equivalent to approximately three kilograms. If a Muslim gives a sa’ of rice or some other staple food of his country, that is sufficient even if it is not one of the types mentioned in the hadith, according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions. 
There is nothing wrong with giving the equivalent amount by weight, which is approximately three kilograms. 
Who should give zakat al-fitr?
Zakat al-fitr must be given on behalf of all Muslims, young and old, male and female, free and slave. With regard to a foetus , it is not obligatory to give it on his behalf according to scholarly consensus, but it is mustahabb, because ‘Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him) did that.   
When should zakat al-fitr be paid?
It is also obligatory to give it before the ‘Eid prayer , and it is not permissible to delay it until after the ‘Eid prayer. There is nothing wrong with giving it one or two days before the ‘Eid. 
Hence it is known that the earliest time when it may be given, according to the more correct of the two scholarly views, is the night of the 28th of Ramadan, because the month may be twenty-nine or thirty days. The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to give it one or two days before ‘Eid. 
To whom should zakat al-fitr be given?
Those to whom it must be given are the poor and needy . It was proven that Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined zakat al-fitr as a purification for the fasting person from idle and obscene speech, and to feed the poor. Whoever gives it before the prayer, it is zakat al-fitr, and whoever gives it after the prayer, it is ordinary charity. This was narrated by Abu Dawud and classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud. 
Can zakat al-fitr be paid in cash?
It is not permissible to pay the value in money , according to the majority of scholars; this view has the stronger evidence. Rather it must be given in the form of food, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) did. This is also the view of the majority of the ummah. 
We ask Allah to help us and all the Muslims to understand His religion properly and adhere to it steadfastly, and to guide us, for He is the Most Generous, Most Kind.  (Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 14/200) 
This is the estimation of Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him), who reckoned the weight of zakat al-fitr as being approximately three kilograms. 
This was also the estimate of the scholars of the Standing Committee (9/371). 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) estimated it in grams as being 2100 grams, as it says in Fatawa al-Zakah, p. 274-276. 
This discrepancy occurred because a sa’ is a measure of volume, not weight. 
The scholars worked it out by weight so that it would be easier to work out. It is well known that the weight of grains varies; some are light and some are heavy, and some are in between. In fact the weight of a sa’ of the same kind of grain may vary, and new may weigh more than old. Hence if people err on the side of caution and give more, that will be better. (See al-Mughni, 4/168, where it mentions something similar about working out the nisab of crops by weight.)

49794,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49794,Fidyah for Missed Fasts Due to Pregnancy and Breastfeeding,"I read that it is permissible for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers not to fast, and that they can feed the poor and do not have to make up the missed days. They quoted as evidence the report narrated from Ibn `Umar concerning that. How true is this? Please answer with evidence, may Allah bless you.","The correct view is that pregnant and breastfeeding women have to make up the missed fasts, and what was narrated from Ibn `Abbas and Ibn `Umar that pregnant and breastfeeding women have to feed the poor instead, is a weak view that goes against the Shar`i evidence.",,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed concerning the ruling on pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers if they do not fast. There are several opinions. 

That they have to make up the fasts only. This is the view of Imam Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him). Among the Companions, it was the view of `Ali ibn Abu Talib (may Allah be pleased with him). 
That if they fear for themselves, they have to make up the fast only, and if they fear for their children then they have to make up the fasts and feed one poor person for each day. This is the view of Imam Ash-Shafi`i and Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on them). Al-Jassas (may Allah have mercy on him) also narrated this from Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). 
That they have to feed the poor only, and do not have to make up the fasts. Among the Companions, this was the view of `Abdullah ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him). Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) also narrated this in Al-Mughni (3/37) from Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). 

Abu Dawud (2318) narrated from Ibn `Abbas and `Ali (may Allah be pleased with them) that this phrase – “those who can fast with difficulty” [Al-Baqarah 2:184] was a concession granted to old men and old women who find it difficult to fast, allowing them not to fast and to feed one poor person for each day instead, and the same for pregnant and breastfeeding women if they are afraid. Abu Dawud (may Allah have mercy on him) said: i.e., for their children – they may not fast and may feed (the poor) instead. An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: its Isnad (chain of narration) is sound. 
This was also narrated by Al-Bazzar (may Allah have mercy on him) who added at the end: Ibn `Abbas used to say to a concubine of his who was pregnant: “You are like one who cannot fast, so you have to pay the Fidyah but you do not have to make up the fasts.” Al-Daraqutni classed its Isnad as authentic, as stated by Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) in At-Talkhis. 
Al-Jassas (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in Ahkam Al-Quran that the scholars differed concerning this issue. He said:
The Salaf differed concerning this matter, and there were three points of view. `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: they have to make up the fast if they do not fast, but they do not have to pay theFidyah. Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: They have to pay the Fidyah but do not have to make up the fasts. Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: They have to pay the Fidyah and make up the fasts. 
Those who said that they only have to make up the fasts quoted the following as evidence: 

The report narrated by An-Nasaa’i (2274) from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has waived half of the prayer for the traveller, and fasting, and for those who are pregnant and breastfeeding.” Classed as authentic by Al-Albaani in Sahih An-Nasa’i. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated that the ruling on pregnant and breastfeeding women is like the ruling on the traveller. The traveller may not fast and has to make it up later, and this also applies to pregnant and breastfeeding women . (See Ahkam Al-Quran by Al-Jassas)
Analogy to the sick. Just as the sick are allowed not to fast and have to make it up later, the same applies to those who are pregnant and breastfeeding. (See Al-Mughni, 3/37; Al-Majmu`, 6/273) 

This view was favoured by a number of scholars. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (15/225): 
“Pregnant and breastfeeding women come be under the same ruling as those who are sick. If it is too difficult for them to fast , then it is prescribed for them not to fast, but they have to make up the fasts when they are able to do so, like those who are sick. Some of the scholars are of the view that it is sufficient for them to feed one poor person for every day they missed, but this is a weak view. The correct view is that they have to make up missed fasts , just like travellers and those who are sick, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days.” [Al-Baqarah 2:184]
He (may Allah have mercy on him) also said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (15/227): 
“The correct view concerning this matter is that pregnant and breastfeeding women have to make up the fasts, and what was narrated from Ibn `Abbas and Ibn `Umar, that pregnant and breastfeeding women have to feed the poor instead, is a weak view that goes against the Shar`i evidence. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days.” [Al-Baqarah 2:184]
Pregnant and breastfeeding women are likened to those who are sick, and do not come under the ruling on old men who are unable to fast. Rather they come under the rule of those who are sick, so they should make up the fasts when they become able to do so, even if that is delayed. 
It says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (10/220): 
“If a pregnant woman fears for herself or her foetus because of fasting in Ramadan, she may break the fast and she only has to make up for the missed fasts. In this regard she is like one who is sick and is unable to fast or fears that fasting will harm him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days.” [Al-Baqarah 2:184]
Similarly if a breastfeeding woman fears for herself if she nurses her child during Ramadan, or she fears for her child if she fasts and does not breastfeed him, then she may not fast, and she only has to make up the missed fasts.” 
It also says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Al-Da’imah (10/226): 
“A pregnant woman has to fast when she is pregnant, unless she fears for herself or her foetus if she fasts, in which case she is allowed not to fast, but she has to make up the missed fasts after she gives birth and becomes pure from postpartum bleeding; it is not sufficient for her to feed a poor person instead, rather she has to fast and does not have to feed a poor person if she does that.” 
Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` (6/220), after mentioning the difference of scholarly opinion about the ruling on this matter, and expressing his preference for the view that she only has to make up the missed fasts : 
“This view is the most likely to be correct in my opinion, because at most they are like one who is sick or travelling, who only have to make up missed fasts.”
