43458,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43458,Can it be understood from the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) got angry on behalf of Faatimah that she was infallible?,"One of the Raafidis presented me with a specious argument, which is the view that Faatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) was infallible, based on the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Faatimah is a part of me and whoever angers her angers me.” He said that the anger of Faatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) is part of the anger of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the anger of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is part of the anger of Allah, hence Faatimah could not get angry for any idle reason, i.e., she was infallible. How can we answer this specious argument?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Raafidis are a people who like to argue and stir up specious arguments which they exaggerate and present them as facts to the common folk in order to prove their point. But the one whom Allah has blessed with understanding of His religion and the ability to ask scholars, will undoubtedly realize the falseness of their arguments and the insignificance of their evidence. That includes the specious argument mentioned by the questioner. This argument may be answered in several ways: 
1 – The Raafidis quote this hadith as evidence, as is mentioned by the questioner, to reach the conclusion that Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) made Faatimah angry when he did not give her what she asked for of the inheritance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). If that is what happened, and Abu Bakr made Faatimah angry, then he also made the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) angry, and thus made Allah angry too! This is a sign of their ignorance and folly, for the hadith was originally narrated concerning ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him). Al-Bukhaari and Muslim narrated that al-Miswar ibn Makhramah said: ‘Ali proposed to the daughter of Abu Jahl. When Faatimah heard of that she came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said to him: Your people are saying that you do not get angry for the sake of your daughters, and ‘Ali is going to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood up and I heard him when he recited the shahaadah, then he said: “I gave a daughter of mine in marriage to Abu’l-‘Aas ibn al-Rabee’, and when he spoke he told me the truth. Faatimah bint Muhammad is a part of me, and I do not like for her to be hurt. By Allah, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah and the daughter of the enemy of Allah will not be joined together as wives of one man.” So ‘Ali abandoned that proposal. According to a version narrated by al-Bukhaari: “Faatimah is part of me and whoever angers her angers me.” [al-Bukhaari no. 3523 and 3556; Muslim, no. 2449]. 
By examining the report quoted above it will be clear that if blame were to be laid on anyone, it would be laid on ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), because the reason why this hadith was narrated was his wish to propose marriage to the daughter of Abu Jahl, as the result of which Faatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) became angry. It is established among the scholars of Usool that what counts is the general meaning of the words, not the specific reason for them, but it is also established that the reason for the text must be taken into account first and foremost and the reason cannot be excluded at all. When the Raafidis quote this hadith as evidence for criticizing Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him), because of their ignorance and trickery, they conceal the fact that criticism – if there is any criticism – would be directed at ‘Ali first of all. 
Secondly: The anger mentioned in the hadith occurred for a specific reason which is mentioned above. This indicates that the anger arose not because Faatimah was infallible or whatever claims the Raafidis make, but because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was keen to protect his daughter’s feelings, and what upset her also upset him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). This is indicated by what is mentioned in the report of Muslim: “Faatimah is a part of me and what hurts her hurts me.” This was offence caused to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and it has nothing to do with the matter of infallibility as those Raafidis claim. 
Thirdly: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in other saheeh ahaadeeth: “Whoever obeys me had obeyed Allah and whoever disobeys me has disobeyed Allah. Whoever obeys my commander has obeyed me and whoever disobeys my commander has disobeyed me.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 6718; Muslim, no. 1835. According to consensus – even among the Raafidis – this does not mean that the commander is infallible; rather some of the commanders sent by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made mistakes in some matters which it is known went against the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). An example of that is the proven report in which ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent out an expedition and he appointed in charge of them a man from among the Ansaar and told them to obey him. He got angry and said: Didn’t the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) tell you to obey me? They said: Yes. He said: Then gather firewood for me. So they gathered it for him and he said: Light a fire. So they lit a fire. He said: Enter it. So they thought of entering it, but some of them held others back and said: We have fled to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to escape the fire. They stayed until the fire burned out and his anger died down. News of that reached the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he said: “If you had entered it you would never have come out of it until the Day of Resurrection. Obedience is only with regard to that which is right and proper.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 4085; Muslim, no. 1840. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) restricted this obedience only to that which is right and proper. So if the anger of Faatimah was part of the anger of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), then according to consensus it is limited only to that which is right and proper, and if the anger of Faatimah was for reasons that were not in accordance with the law of Allah, then what is right and proper is to implement the law of Allah, even if it angered Faatimah. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If Faatimah the daughter of Muhammad were to steal, I would cut off her hand.” And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O Faatimah bint Muhammad, save yourselves, for I cannot avail you anything before Allah, ask for whatever you want of my wealth.” This implies that she was not infallible.

43476,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43476,He is having a problem with his second wife and he fears for his daughter,"I would appreciate if you could guide me and let me know about below mentioned queries as per Islamic Ruling and Values, those are as follows: A. If a wife (my 2nd wife) fabricate false documents and files cases one after an other about dowry, maintenance etc and abuse her husband behind his back while living with her mother. What are the Islamic ruling on this. (I have tried to reconcile with her but no avail and this will be her 3rd divorce but she doesn't feel ashamed. She just want money.) B. She file a divorce case in the court. Should it be considered a Khula. if not then why not. C. Who should have the custody of a child. I don't want to say bad things about her just describing few facts. As her life style is not caring and good enough to raise a child. Her formal and informal education is low level. So in future her style will influence the child's characters. On top of that by phone she told me that she will make my child a bad person. To save that child who should have the custody. Even-though, if she works and makes some money but money is not a life, life means values, such as living with high social, moral and religious values. From above mentioned values side, she is not very strong. D. When she works, her mother can take care of our child. Her mother's is an illiterate person and she, (I overheard) her mother use bad words for our child. How can she educate her etc. As per Islamic law, is it right to let some else in a family to take care of the child instead of her father. Who is more educated and have high standard for religious and other values. More respectable in the society. I believe I can make my child a good citizen with high social, moral and religious values.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The basic principle concerning divorce is that it is makrooh 
    (disliked), as is indicated by the verse in which Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Those who take an oath not to have sexual relation with 
    their wives must wait for four months, then if they return (change their 
    idea in this period), verily, Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

    227. And if they decide upon divorce, then Allaah is 
    All-Hearer, All-Knower”

    [al-Baqarah 2:226] 

    In relation to changing their minds He said “Oft-Forgiving, 
    Most Merciful” and in relation to divorce He said “All-Hearer, 
    All-Knower”. This indicates a kind of warning, which in turn indicates 
    that divorce is disliked by Allaah (makrooh).  

    But there may be some cases in which divorce is inevitable, 
    and even essential. In the case which you mention, divorce may be the 
    appropriate solution, because it is unthinkable that a wife would treat her 
    husband in such a bad way as you describe in your question. A woman could 
    say or do something to offend her husband, but to be constantly ungrateful 
    is very strange.  

    But before divorce, you have to try to reconcile first, and 
    put up with the woman. If she has some bad characteristics, you will also 
    find some good qualities, so you can put up with the bad characteristics 
    because of the good ones. 

    See questions no. 20044 
    and 2076. 

    If you can get some relatives involved to solve the problem, 
    then do so, as an act of mercy to this poor girl who will suffer – no matter 
    what the situation – from the bitterness of separation and the break-up of 
    the family. 

    If divorce is the final solution, and you have exhausted all 
    possible solutions, then pray istikhaarah (asking for guidance) and consult 
    others, and put your trust in Allaah. 

    With regard to the matters that she has referred to the 
    court, this may be a request to the qaadi (judge) to compel the husband to 
    divorce her by talaaq or it may be khula’, depending on the situation. If 
    she is going to give the husband some money or return the mahr to him in 
    return for getting a divorce, then this is khula’; if she is not going to 
    pay anything then this is talaaq, if it takes place. 

    With regard to custody, the basic principle is that the 
    mother has more right to custody, so long as there is no impediment to that. 
    If there is any impediment, such as the mother marrying someone who is a 
    stranger (non-mahram) to the child, or the mother’s character or attitude is 
    bad, then custody passes to the mother’s mother according to the majority. 
    If the mother’s mother is the same (i.e., of bad character etc) then custody 
    passes to the father. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was of the view that in 
    the case of a dispute between the mother’s mother and the father, custody 
    should be given to the father, because he is closer to the child. This view 
    was also favoured by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen in his commentary on the chapter 
    on custody in Zaad al-Mustaqni’. We have already discussed this in 
    detail in question no. 5234,

43479,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43479,What constitutes intercourse?,"Ghusl is required if intercourse takes place, but what is meant by intercourse? Is any kind of foreplay regarded as intercourse?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Not all kinds of foreplay are regarded as intercourse; rather 
    intercourse is when the tip of the penis disappears fully into the vagina. 
    If that happens, then intercourse has taken place; if no penetration occurs 
    or if only part of the tip penetrates but not all of it, then this is not 
    intercourse. This is what is indicated by the ahaadeeth: 

    It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “When a man sits between the four parts (arms and legs of his wife) and has 
    intercourse with her, then ghusl is obligatory.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 
    291; Muslim, 525. 

    The phrase translated as “[has intercourse with her]” is a 
    metaphor for inserting the penis into the vagina. This was stated by 
    al-Haafiz in al-Fath. 
The Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When a man sits 
    between the four parts (arms and legs of his wife) and the one circumcised 
    part touches the other, then ghusl is obligatory.” Narrated by Muslim, 349. 

    Al-Nawawi said in Sharh Muslim: 
With regard to the 
    phrase “and the one circumcised part touches the other, then ghusl is 
    obligatory”: the scholars said: what this means is when your penis 
    disappears into her vagina; it does not mean touching in a real sense. That 
    is because the circumcised part of a woman is above the vagina, and the 
    penis does not touch it during intercourse. The scholars are unanimously 
    agreed that if he places his penis on the circumcised part and does not 
    enter (the vagina), then no ghusl is required, neither for him nor for her. 

    The fact that what is meant is what we have mentioned and 
    that what is meant by touching is the two parts coming in line with one 
    another is indicated by the other report, “when the two circumcised parts 
    meet” i.e., coming in line with one another.  

    It says in al-Majmoo’ (2/150): 
The obligation of ghusl 
    and all other rulings that have to do with intercourse are subject to the 
    condition that the tip of the penis disappears completely into the vagina, 
    and they are not dependent on more than that. None of the rulings have to 
    with part of the tip disappearing only. End quote. 

    Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath: 

    What is meant by touching and meeting is coming in line with 
    one another, which is indicated by a report narrated by al-Tirmidhi. It does 
    not mean touching in a literal sense, because that does not happen when the 
    tip of the penis disappears. End quote. 

    Al-Shawkaani said: The ahaadeeth mention the words coming in 
    line with one another, meeting, touching, but what is meant by meeting is 
    coming in line with one another. 

    Al-Qaadi Abu Bakr said: If the tip of the penis disappears 
    into the vagina, then ‘meeting’ has taken place. End quote. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:  

    It is well known that the site of circumcision is above the 
    tip. As that is the case, then it cannot touch the site of circumcision of 
    the woman until the tip has penetrated. Hence it is stipulated that for 
    ghusl following intercourse to be obligatory, the tip must disappear. It is 
    narrated in some versions of the hadeeth of ‘Abd-‘Allaah ibn ‘Amr ibn 
    al-‘Aas: “When the two circumcised parts meet and the tip of the penis 
    disappears, then ghusl becomes obligatory.” End quote. Narrate by Ibn 
    Maajah, 611; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 
    11/323 
Based on this, what is 
    meant by the one circumcised part touching the other and the meeting of the 
    two circumcised parts is when the site of circumcision of the man comes into 
    line with the site of circumcision of the woman, and that happens when the 
    entire tip of the penis disappears into the vagina. If the tip of the penis 
    disappears into the vagina then intercourse has taken place and ghusl is 
    required.

43480,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43480,What can a Muslim woman uncover in front of kaafir mahrams and women?,"I was wondering is it permissible for me to mix, sit with and take off my hijab in front of my father-in-law who is kaafir? and how about my mother-in-law can i take my hijab off in front of her? can u also advice me how i should treat them?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly:  
There is nothing wrong with a Muslim woman mixing with her mahrams, including kaafirs who are forbidden to her in marriage (because of close ties of blood or marriage, such as the father-in-law), if there is no danger of fitnah from them. The same applies to kaafir women among her relatives or others whom she has to mix with for some reason, such as her husband’s mother. The Muslim woman should call them to Islam in ways that are better, by showing the best attitudes promoted in Islam, such as speaking and acting kindly, whilst adhering to Islamic rulings such as not being the first to greet them and not feeling love towards them in the heart. 
With regard to the way she should dress in front of them, it is permissible for a Muslim woman to uncover in front of her mahrams and womenfolk as much as is customary among people of religious commitment and good manners, such as uncovering the head, neck, forearms and part of the calf. 
Whether the women and mahrams are Muslims or kaafirs, there is no difference in the ruling. 
But it is not permissible for a Muslim woman to wear short clothes in front of them, or thin (see-though) clothes, or tight clothes that show the shape of the ‘awrah. The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 
A woman should be modest, even if no one can see her except other women, she should not uncover anything more than is customary or needs to be uncovered, such as going out in the kind of clothes that she wears when doing housework, showing the face, hands and feet and the like. That is more concealing and farther removed from any doubt or suspicion. 
Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 17/288, 289 
Shaykh Muhamamd ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen said: 
With regard to her mahrams what she may uncover is the same as that which she may uncover in front of other women, so she may uncover her head, neck, feet, hands, forearms and calves, etc. But she should not make her clothes short. 
Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 12/276, 277 
See the answers to questions no, 12371, 6569 for more quotations and explanations from the scholars concerning what a woman may and may not show in front of other women and her mahrams. 
Secondly: 
Some scholars differentiate between Muslim women and kaafir women, and do not allow taking off the hijab in front of kaafir women. This is a less correct view, because Jewish women used to enter upon ‘Aa’ishah and others among the women of the Sahaabah, and it is not known that they wore hijab in front of them. 
The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: 
Is it obligatory to wear hijab in front of kaafir women, or can we interact with them as we interact with Muslim women? 
They replied: 
There are two views among the scholars regarding this matter. The more correct view is that it is not obligatory, because no such thing was narrated from the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or from others among the women of the Sahaabah when they met with Jewish and idolater women in Madeenah. If that had happened it would have been transmitted as less serious matters were transmitted.   
And they said: 
There is no reason why a woman should not uncover her face in front of another woman, whether she is a Muslim or a kaafir, because women are only commanded to cover their faces in front of men who are not their mahrams. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“…and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms) and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband’s fathers, or their sons, or their husband’s sons, or their brothers or their brother’s sons, or their sister’s sons, or their women…” [al-Noor 24:31]
So Allah commanded them to draw their veils over their faces in front of men, except for the mahrams mentioned in this verse, or those who are their mahrams because of breastfeeding (radaa’ah), as mentioned in other verses. 
What is meant by “women” in this verse is all women, both Muslim and non-Muslim. And Allah knows best. 
Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 17/287, 288 
And Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
Is it permissible for a Muslim woman to uncover her hair in front of a non-Muslim woman, especially as she may describe the Muslim women to her male relatives who are not Muslim? 
He replied: 
This is a matter that is based on different scholarly interpretations of the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent (like both eyes for necessity to see the way, or outer palms of hands or one eye or dress like veil, gloves, headcover, apron), and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms) and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband’s fathers, or their sons, or their husband’s sons, or their brothers or their brother’s sons, or their sister’s sons, or their women…” [al-Noor 24:31]
The scholars differed concerning the pronoun in the word nisaa’ihinna (“their women”). Some of them said that what is meant is the gender, i.e., all women in general. And some of them said that what is meant is the type of women, i.e., believing women only. According to the first view, it is permissible for a woman to uncover her hair and face in front of non-Muslim women, but according to the second view it is not permissible. We are more inclined towards the first view because it is more sound, because among women there is no difference between a Muslim woman and a non-Muslim woman. This is so long as there is no fitnah (temptation). But if there is the fear of fitnah, such as if the woman may describe her (the Muslim woman) to her male relatives, then it is essential to take precautions in that case, and the woman should not uncover any part of her body, such as the feet or hair, in front of the other woman, whether she is Muslim or non-Muslim.

43481,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43481,He said to his wife: You are divorced when we go back to our country,I was travelling with my husband and we had an argument. He said: You are divorced when we go back to our country. We have come back now. Does this divorce count as such?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If the husband said to the wife: You are divorced when we go 
    back to our country, then the divorce takes effect when you return to your 
    country, because this is what he meant, i.e., it was not intended to 
    encourage or discourage, or to confirm or deny, rather it is like when a 
    person says: “When the first day of the month comes”, or “when Ramadan 
    comes”, or “when the ruler comes, then my wife is divorced.” By saying these 
    words, your husband did not intend to prevent you or prevent himself from 
    returning to his country, nor did he intend to encourage you to stay outside 
    your country; what he meant was divorce. 

    If we assume that he said: “I meant that I would divorce you 
    after we came back”, this is not acceptable either, because by saying “You 
    are divorced”, clearly using the word divorce (talaaq), it cannot be 
    accepted that what he meant and intended was a threat of divorce. 

    As for the statement of divorce which is intended to stop 
    someone doing something, such as saying, “You are divorced if you go out of 
    the house”, intending to prevent her going out, or that which is intended to 
    encourage her to do something, such as saying, “You are divorced if you do 
    not come back to the house,” this is a statement of divorce concerning which 
    the scholars differed. The majority of them are of the view that divorce 
    does take place when the thing stipulated happens, but a number of them are 
    of the view that divorce does not take place, because he did not intend to 
    divorce her, rather he intended to encourage her to do something or prevent 
    her from doing something. 

    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) narrated that 
    al-Qaadi Abu Ya’la said, speaking of an oath to divorce and differentiating 
    between that and a statement of divorce that is intended as such: This is 
    his stipulating a condition by means of which he intends to encourage her to 
    do something, or prevent her from doing something, such as saying, “If you 
    enter the house then you are divorced”, or “if you do not enter the house 
    then you are divorced.” 

    With regard to a statement of divorce other than that, such 
    as saying, “You are divorced when the sun rises”, or “when the pilgrim comes 
    back”, or “if the ruler does not come,” this is a statement of divorce which 
    is intended as such and is not an oath.  

    End quote from al-Mughni, 7/333 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him) said: An oath to divorce is a statement of divorce 
    by means of which the person intends to encourage (his wife) to do 
    something, or to prevent her from doing something, or to urge his listeners 
    to believe him or disbelieve him. This is the oath to divorce which is 
    intended to encourage or discourage something, or to confirm or deny 
    something, unlike a statement of divorce which is intended as such, which 
    cannot be regarded as an oath, such as saying, “When the sun rises, my wife 
    is divorced,” or “When Ramadaan comes, my wife is divorced.” This is not 
    described as an oath (yameen), rather it is simply a statement of divorce in 
    which a condition is stipulated, and when the stipulated event takes place, 
    the divorce comes into effect. If he says for example, “When Ramadaan comes 
    my wife is divorced,” then the divorce takes effect when Ramadaan begins. If 
    he says, “When the sun rises, my wife is divorced,” then the divorce takes 
    effect when the sun rises. 

    And he said: But if there is no encouragement or 
    discouragement, rather it is simply stipulating a condition, then this is a 
    statement of divorce in which the divorce counts as such, as stated above, 
    such as if he says: “When the month of Ramadaan begins then my wife is 
    divorced.” This is stipulating a condition, and when that happens the 
    divorce takes effect, because the thing that is attached to a condition 
    takes effect when the condition comes to pass. This is the basic principle.” 
    End quote from Fataawa al-Talaaq, p. 129-131 
The Standing Committee 
    was asked about a man who said to his wife: When your period comes then you 
    are purified, then you are divorced, but after that he decided to keep his 
    wife and not divorce her. 
They replied: This is a 
    divorce that is connected to a stipulated condition, and he did not intend 
    thereby to encourage her to do something or prevent her from doing 
    something, so the divorce takes effect when that condition comes to pass, 
    which is her purification after her menses. Recanting this condition after 
    it has come to pass is not valid. End quote.

He can’t make his parents see that he loves me so much and that I’m a good girl. Also I can’t help him and talk to them, because he said that it’s not allowed to bring a woman/girl into his parents house. How can I help him with this ? Why is’t talking about it possible ? How can you solve problems when you can’t even have a discussion ? Didn’t Allah create people so they would know one another ? I believe in God/Allah, I’m trying to be a good person and pray every day. My parents raised me as a christian, but sinds I got to know a little bit about the Islam I can’t believe in the christian’s ways anymore. I think that the Islam is for me, but my boyfriend and I agreed that we concentrate on this when our problem – accepting of his parents of us - is solved. I want my relation with Allah to be pure and not being influenced by other things; A boyfriend can not be the reason why I should accept the Islam in my life, can it ? Am I to blame when I accept the islam – and keep on believing in Allah as I do now- to make things easyer for us, because the parents want that. I know a good Muslim not only thinks about him-/her-self and has to think about all the people around him/her, but I can’t accept the fact that our love has to end, just because his parents want this. Is this the will of Allah ? Please give us advise on what to do. Why can’t they talk to me ? How can we make them understand that they cannot judge before they even know me ? And do you have any advise for him, is't going to be a very difficult dicision.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    We ask Allaah to guide you and to show you the right path, 
    for He is Able to do that. 

    Firstly: 

    We thank you for submitting your question to this Islamic 
    website, which indicates that you have trust and are keen to find out the 
    correct answer. 

    Secondly: 

    A number of the things that you find strange, as mentioned in 
    your question, are regarded by us Muslims as normal, whereas others find 
    them objectionable. 

    The reason is well known among the Muslims: the attitude of 
    worldview of the Muslim is based on full submission to the rulings of Allaah 
    and His Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and 
    total obedience to Allaah, the Creator, the Provider, the Giver of life and 
    death, because He has enjoined that upon us, and He knows best what is right 
    for us. 

    For example: you find it very strange that your boyfriend’s 
    parents denounce the relationship between you, because according to the way 
    you were brought up and what you are used to in the non-Islamic society in 
    which you live, you think that this relationship is something natural and 
    normal, in which two human souls come together and feel at ease with one 
    another and satisfy their physical inclinations; he does things for you and 
    you do things for him in return, and he speaks softly to you and you speak 
    softly to him, and you can exchange gifts, etc. 

    Islam does not forbid kind words, good treatment and 
    gift-giving, but a Muslim man should not be alone with a non-mahram woman 
    [i.e., one who is not a close blood relative] and be intimate with her 
    outside the framework of marriage, because the evil consequences and harm 
    that that leads to, such as loss of chastity, committing zina (unlawful 
    sexual relationship), the violation of honour, conception of illegitimate 
    children and confusion of lineage, are far worse than nice relationships and 
    the exchange of gifts. 

    If it were not for the intimacy you are seeking from one 
    another, the nice treatment you are giving to one another would not have 
    taken place. 

    Also if there is the firm intention and resolve to get 
    married in the future and have children who will grow up as Muslims, that 
    still does not justify this forbidden relationship which involves many 
    things that are forbidden in Islam. 

    We wonder, if the relationship is so deep and strong, and you 
    have the sincere intention of getting married, why don’t you both repent 
    from this forbidden relationship and immediately enter upon a proper, 
    legitimate relationship as allowed in Islam, based on marriage which Allaah 
    has prescribed. 

    The Islamic marriage contract is not something difficult or 
    complicated, rather it is very easy. See question no. 
    2127 and 
    813 for more 
    information about the marriage contract in Islam. 

    Thirdly: 

    It is not true that speaking to one’s father is difficult 
    among Muslims. There is no society that is more distinguished by its strong 
    family ties than the Muslim societies. Indeed, a quick glance at the state 
    of the family in the west will show that sons are far away from their 
    parents and the parents’ rights are not respected, let alone what that leads 
    to of children being neglected and daughters being lost. Islam enjoins 
    children to show respect to their parents, as non-Muslims who do not enjoy 
    such a relationship realize. Because the mother tends to be gentle, loving 
    and compassionate towards her children, and the father tends be to strict 
    and take a rational and unemotional approach towards things, many children 
    find it easier to talk to their mothers than to their fathers, especially 
    with regard to emotional problems. But that does not mean that it is 
    difficult for Muslims to talk to their fathers. 

    But some people may have been brought up in a way that was 
    not entirely right, which may have affected some of their behaviour and 
    attitudes, but only in a general sense. The Muslim is supposed to love his 
    fellow-Muslim who is a stranger, so what about one who is close to him – 
    what about sons and fathers? Each of them should care about the interests of 
    the other and love that which is best for him. This brings us to the second 
    point: which is that his parents’ objection to this marriage does not mean 
    that they are trying to control their son and does not mean that they have 
    judged you without seeing you. Rather any father – and especially in a 
    Muslim society – wants the best life for his son, and because the father has 
    greater experience of life and has lived longer, and he knows how things 
    are, he does not want his son to do something reckless which he may later 
    regret. 

    The father will try to keep his son away from everything that 
    may be labeled a failure, so he does not want him to embark on something 
    risky such as this marriage, because marriage in Islam is a strong 
    relationship which does not just last for a limited time like the forbidden 
    love of boyfriends and girlfriends; rather it is a relationship between the 
    two spouses which should be ongoing and stable. So the choice (of a marriage 
    partner) should only be made after much serious consideration and 
    consultation with those who know more about life than we do. Naturally the 
    difference of religion will be a cause of division between spouses, or will 
    cause problems in the future, especially when children come along. We have 
    heard of many such problems on this site. 

    Yes, Islam does not forbid a Muslim man to marry a chaste 
    Christian or Jewish woman; Islam allows that, but it does not encourage it. 
    Our Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) urged us to 
    choose a wife who is righteous, religiously committed and has a good 
    attitude. 

    Hence the fact that his parents have rejected this marriage 
    was not a hasty judgement, rather it was because they know how things are. 

    You may say, “My marriage to this man will be different, but 
    they don’t realize that.” 

    Again I say: it will be different, but no father wants his 
    son to go through an experience he does not need, especially when the 
    current relationship between you is forbidden according to Islam. 

    Fourthly: 

    You ask, Will there by any blame on me if I accept Islam – 
    outwardly – and continue to believe in Allaah as I do now? 

    The answer is that this is a serious matter. Our pure 
    monotheistic religion cannot be toyed with, or used for personal motives. 
    Hence one of the basic principles of this religion is: 

    “There is no compulsion in religion. Verily, the Right 
    Path has become distinct from the wrong path. Whoever disbelieves in 
    Taaghootand believes in Allaah, then he has grasped the 
    most trustworthy handhold that will never break”
    [al-Baqarah 2:256]

    If a person enters the religion of Allaah as a game with no 
    serious intent, he deserves the curse of Allaah and he will be with the 
    disbelievers, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth 
    (grade) of the Fire”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:145]

    Fifthly: 

    This problem may be solved in several ways, the first, best 
    and quickest of which is for you to start to learn what Islam really is, the 
    comprehensive nature of this religion, and how it is in accordance with the 
    sound nature of man. So learn about the religion of Islam, for no other 
    reason than to find out the truth and to get out of the vicious circle of 
    confusing ideas and beliefs that go against sound nature and reason. 

    Then – if you strive hard – you will come to know the clear 
    truth and the light of certain faith, and the matter of marriage will become 
    easy for you – if Allaah wills. There is nothing wrong with your marriage to 
    this man being a reason for you finding out about Islam. 

    But if you take this first step, it is better and more 
    appropriate than getting married and then thinking about Islam.  

    If the family consists of two Muslim spouses from the outset, 
    then Allaah will bless it and care for it, and they will be the basis of a 
    family that is beloved to Allaah, because it is Muslim. 

    Perhaps if you and your boyfriend announce that you have 
    repented and get married according to Islamic sharee’ah, this will reduce 
    his parents’ worries and negative attitude. 

    If you tell them that you have entered Islam, then the One 
    Who is more important than anyone else will be pleased with that, namely 
    Allaah, may He be exalted. If you please Allaah, no matter whom you anger 
    among your family, He will be pleased with you and will cause people to be 
    pleased with you. 

    It may be appropriate – but you need to think about this and 
    choose the right time– for you to visit his mother yourself, without your 
    boyfriend being with you, so you can tell her that you are keen to enter 
    Islam and repent from this forbidden relationship, and marry her son 
    according to the laws of Allaah. 

    As we have mentioned above, Islam allows marriage to chaste 
    non-Muslim women, so why not start to live a chaste and pure life, far away 
    from any relationship that goes against that? 

    Your saying that your boyfriend cannot be the reason why you 
    accept Islam is true in a sense, in that you will become Muslim not for love 
    of this person but for love of the truth and love of Allaah Who has chosen 
    Islam as the religion for mankind. The evidence for this is clear and does 
    not need a strong emotional motive, because the evidence and proof of the 
    truth is sufficient.  

    We must not forget, before ending this answer, to commend the 
    phrase you used in your question, which is, “Since I got to know a little 
    bit about Islam I can’t believe in the Christians’ ways any more.” This 
    indicates that you are very close to the truth and that your conviction is 
    taking the right shape, and that truth and falsehood cannot reside together 
    in your heart. This is a good sign. 

    Ask Allaah to guide you to the path of truth and to open your 
    eyes to the light. May Allaah guide you to the straight path. And Allaah 
    knows best.

43485,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43485,Girls wearing skimpy and short clothes,What is the ruling on girls who have not yet reached puberty wearing pants and skimpy clothes?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The definition of the ‘awrah of children, male and female, is something for which there is no clear evidence in the Qur’aan and Sunnah. The view of most of the fuqaha’ is that when a girl reaches the age where she may be desired by those of a sound nature, then her ‘awrah is like that of an adult woman. But if she has not reached that age, then it is permissible to make concessions about her hijab until she does reach that age. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: There is no ruling on the ‘awrah of a very young girl, and she does not have to cover her face, neck, hands and feet, and a small girl should not be obliged to do that. But when a girl reaches an age when men could be attracted to her and desire her, then she should observe hijab so as to ward off fitnah and evil. This varies from one woman to another; some of them grow quickly and start looking attractive and others do not.  
With regard to wearing skimpy clothes, it is better not to let young girls get used to such clothes. It is important for girls to grow up loving virtue, until they get used to it. Hence Islam gives children a preparatory stage in which they can get used to praying and does not make it obligatory all of a sudden, because it takes time to get used to it and learn it. When a girl is nine years old, she should start learning and getting used to what will be required of her, before she reaches puberty. It does not make any sense to make the difference between covering the ‘awrah and not doing so the night when the girl gets her period and reaches puberty. That should not happen. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: I think that people should not dress their daughters in these clothes when they are young because if the girl gets used to them she will continue to wear them and take the matter lightly. But if she gets used to modesty from an early age, she will remain modest when she grows up. What I advise my Muslim sisters to do is to forsake the clothing of foreigners and enemies of Islam, and make their daughters get used to wearing concealing clothes and to modesty, for it is part of faith.
 From Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen in al-Da’wah magazine, issue no. 1709, p. 35. 
It is well known that there is no ruling on the ‘awrah of a child who is younger than seven, but there can be no doubt that letting children get used to short and skimpy clothes will make them careless about uncovering their ‘awrah in the future, and a person may not be bothered about uncovering his thighs because he used to uncover them when he was little. 
So we should prevent children from wearing such clothes even when they are small.",Islam Q&A
43496,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43496,He is suffering severe pain in his lower back; does that mean he should not get married?,"I am 28yr male, well settled in life with good job. My problem is, I am suffering from sievere lower back pain since one year and my parents are planning to arrange my marriage. I am confused wether I should go for marriage? What is right in this situation? Shall I go for this marriage?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.You should refer your case to a specialist doctor. If it is proven that this kind of pain may affect fertility or prevent intercourse, or makes a person unable to work and earn money, then you have to inform the woman you want to marry about this. If she accepts it, then there is nothing wrong with you marrying her. If you do not point it out then you are deceiving her. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever deceives is not one of us.” Narrated by Muslim, 102. 
What we have mentioned is based on the correct view, which is that every fault that may affect the purpose of marriage must be disclosed; the spouse has the right to annul the marriage if such a fault is discovered after being concealed. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: … by analogy, every fault that puts the other spouse off and hinders the purpose of marriage, namely compassion and love, should be disclosed and the option of annulment given. (Zaad al-Ma’aad, 5/166). 
And he said: Whoever studies the fatwas of the Sahaabah and the salaf will realize that they did not specify one fault (as grounds of annulment) to the exclusion of others. 
And he said: If the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade the seller to conceal any fault in his product, and he forbade anyone who knows of it to conceal it from the buyer, then what about faults that affect marriage? The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Faatimah bint Qays, when she consulted him about whether she should marry Mu’aawiyah or Abu’l-Jahm: “As for Mu’aawiyah, he is a poor man who has no money, and as for Abu’l-Jahm his stick is always over his shoulder [this may mean either that he travels a lot, or that he habitually beats his wives].” From this we know that disclosing faults with regard to marriage is more appropriate, so how can concealing them and deceiving people be a means of completing the marriage ?
From Zaad al-Ma’aad, 5/168 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The correct view is that a fault is anything that affects the purpose of marriage, and undoubtedly the purposes of marriage are intimacy, service and producing offspring. These are some of the most important purposes, and if there is anything that prevents this purposes being fulfilled, then it is a fault. Based on this, if the wife finds the husband to be sterile or the husband finds the wife to be barren, then this is a fault.

The fact that the Hadith is inauthentic does not mean that divorce is permissible and is not disliked by Allah.",,"Praise be to Allah.A Hadith concerning the notion that the Throne of Allah shakes because of divorce has been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but it is a fabricated and false Hadith. 
This is what has been narrated from `Ali ibn Abu Talib (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not issue divorce, for the Throne shakes because of divorce.” (Narrated by Ibn `Adiyy in Al-Kamil, 5/112, and by Al-Khatib in Tarikh Baghdad, 12/191, and via Ibn Al-Jawzi in Al-Mawdu`at, 2/277, via `Amr ibn Jumay` from Juwaybir from Ad-Dahhak from An-Nazzal ibn Sabrah from `Ali ibn Abu Talib (may Allah be pleased with him))
Ibn Al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“It is a fabricated Hadith… `Amr ibn Jumay` used to narrate inauthentic Hadiths from prominent people, and fabricated Hadiths from sound narrators.”
He was classified as weak and a fabricator by many scholars, including the following: 
Al-Khatib Al-Baghdadi in Tarikh Baghdad (12/187), Ibn Al-Qaysarani in Dhakhirat Al-Huffadh (2/1147), Ash-Sakhawi in Al-Maqasid Al-Hasanah (p. 31), Ash-Shawkani in Al-Fawa’id Al-Majmu`ah (p. 139), As-San`ani and Al-`Ajluni in Kashf Al-Khafa’ (1/361), and Al-Albani in As-Silsilah Ad-Da`ifah (1/278, Hadith no. 147). 
The fact that the Hadith is inauthentic does not mean that divorce is permissible and is not disliked by Allah. Rather divorce is disliked by Allah, and is not permissible except when there is a need for it. A man does not have the right to divorce his wife for no good reason that makes it permissible. 
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The basic principle concerning divorce is that it is forbidden, and it is only permitted as much as is necessary.”  (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 33/81)
Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The basic principle concerning divorce is that it is disliked, and the evidence for that is the verse in which Allah says concerning those who swore not to have intercourse with their wives for four months (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Those who take an oath not to have sexual relations with their wives must wait for four months, then if they return (change their idea in this period), verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And if they decide upon divorce, then Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.” [Al-Baqarah 2:226-227]
This (the phrase “then Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower”) is a kind of warning, whereas in the case of taking back the wife, Allah says, “verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”. This indicates that divorce is not liked by Allah, and that the basic principle is that divorce is disliked.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 10/428)
