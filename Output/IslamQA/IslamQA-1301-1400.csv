There is nothing special about these particular days at all. All the days of Rajab are special, with no exception, because Rajab is one of the Sacred Months, like Dhoo’l- Qi’dah, Dhoo’l-Hijjah and Muharram.
The thirteenth day of each month - not just Rajab - is one of the three Ayyaam al-Beed (white days) on which it is encouraged to fast. These days are the 13th, 14th, and 15th of each hijri month.
Many of those who follow bid’ah (innovations) think that there is something special about certain days and do special acts of worship on those days, with no sound Islaamic basis or evidence (daleel). Their deeds are not acceptable, because they have innovated something in the religion of Allah without the permission of Allah.

Can diabetics fast?","Praise be to Allah.Can sick people break the fast?
It is prescribed for sick people not to fast in Ramadan, if fasting will cause harm or make the sickness worse, or if they need treatment during the day in the form of medicine or pills that must be swallowed. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah loves people to avail themselves of His concessions (rukhsah) just as He hates them to commit sin.” According to another version, “As He loves His commands to be obeyed.” 
Can we check sugar during fasting?
With regard to taking blood from veins for testing etc., the correct view is that this does not break the fast, but if it is done often, it is better to leave it until night-time. If it is done during the day then to be on the safe side that day should be made up, because this is akin to cupping.” (Fatwa of Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him), from Fatawa Islamiyyah, vol. 2, p. 139) 
Can diabetics fast?
Sickness is of various kinds: 

That which does not affect the fast, such as a light cold or mild headache or toothache, and the like. In this case it is not permissible to break the fast, even though some of the scholars permitted that because of the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): “and whoever is ill…”[al-Baqarah 2:185]

But we say that this ruling is based on a reason, which is that not fasting is easier. If that is the case, then we would say that not fasting is better, but if fasting does not have an effect on him then it is not permissible to break the fast, and he has to fast. 

If fasting is difficult for the sick person, but it does not harm him, then it is makruh for him to fast and it is Sunnah for him to break his fast. 
If fasting is difficult for him and will cause him harm , such as a man who has kidney disease or diabetes and similar cases where fasting will cause harm. In this case fasting is haram. Hence we may see that some mujtahids and sick people make a mistake when fasting is difficult for them and may harm them, but they refuse to break their fast. We say that they are mistaken because they refuse to accept the kindness of Allah and the concession that He has given to them, and they are harming themselves, although Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And do not kill yourselves”[al-Nisa 4:29] (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, vol. 6, 352-254)

1326,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1326,Does a woman’s continual discharge break her wudu?,A woman sees some liquids (yellow color) in her underware while she is not in period. This frequently happens to her and causes a real difficulty for praying specially out side the home and as you know women in this country go out of their home frequently. What is the judgment on these liquids (pure or inpure) and should she change the underwar every time!? and What is the status of her wudu?,,,"Praise be to Allah.What is well-known is that the scholars say that everything that is discharged from the front and back passages is naajis (impure) except for one thing, semen, which is taahir (pure); apart from that everything else that has substance is naajis and breaks one’s wudu. On this basis, whatever fluid comes out of a woman is naajis and requires her to renew her wudu. This is what I understand after researching the issue with some scholars and consulting reference material. However, I did not feel entirely comfortable about this issue, because some women always have this discharge; if this is the case, then she should handle it as incontinence is handled: if she has wudu she should wash her private parts when the time for prayer comes, and be careful not to let the urine contaminate her. This is similar to the advice that the Prophet gave to the woman suffering from istihaadah (abnormal non-menstrual bleeding).
Having also discussed the matter with some doctors, it is clear that if the discharge is from the bladder, the woman should do as described above; if it is from the vagina then she must perform wudu because of it, but the discharge is taahir and she does not have to wash her clothes if it gets on them.",From the Fataawa of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen
1333,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1333,Munkar actions during mourning    ceremonies,"We would like to ask you to explain to us whether what we do during mourning ceremonies or obsequies is correct according to sharee’ah. We do the following:
We recite Soorat al-Faatihah over the grave of the deceased.
The offering of condolences may last for three days or more, and we eat and drink during the mourning ceremonies.
Twenty-five riyaals are collected from each person and the money is given to the family of the deceased.
We slaughter a sheep or similar animal three days after the death.
We gather pebbles whilst saying “Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah” out loud, and put them on the grave of the deceased.
The women raise their voices, weeping and wailing, and they strike their cheeks and eulogize the deceased.
The women wear clothes of coarse black cloth as a sign of mourning.
The women do not do any kind of work during their ‘iddah period, such as preparing food or doing any other kind of work that is usually done by women.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There are jaahili customs, or reprehensible innovations, and you have to give them up and explain to others that they are wrong.

With regard to reciting Qur’aan over the grave of the deceased, this is not permissible, and none of the Salaf did this. If it were good to do this, they would have done it before us. It has been reported that Soorat Yaa-Seen should be recited for the person who is dying, before his soul departs, but after he has died and when he is being buried and after the burial, there is nothing that should be recited, and one should not tell him to say “Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah” and so on.


Offering condolences is Sunnah, but it need not be during the mourning ceremonies. Condolences may be offered to the family of the deceased in all places. There is nothing wrong with all the relatives of the deceased gathering together in one place so that people may come and offer their condolences, but they should not gather for the purpose of eating. Food should be prepared only for the immediate family of the deceased; it is makrooh for them to offer food to others.


There is no need to gather this money from everyone, unless the family are poor, in which case they may be given zakaat funds.


It is not permissible to slaughter this sheep, whether it is from the wealth of the deceased or from someone else. But if food is prepared for the family of the deceased, from one or more animals, there is nothing wrong with this.


Collecting these pebbles, and making dhikr whilst doing so, and putting them on the grave – this is a reprehensible innovation (bid’ah) which must be given up and denounced.


Raising one’s voice in wailing and lamenting, striking the cheeks and eulogizing the deceased are all bid’ah and actions of the jaahiliyyah. It was reported in a hadeeth: “He is not one of us who strikes his cheeks, rends his garments and calls with the call of the jaahiliyyah.”

(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1294, Fath 3/163; Muslim, 103; Ahmad, 1/244).
Wearing black as a sign of mourning for the deceased is bid’ah; but the wives of the deceased should avoid wearing fancy or adorned clothes, jewellery, makeup and perfume during their period of mourning.
It is bid’ah for women to avoid their usual work and activities; the newly-widowed woman can still prepare food, clean the house, wash the dishes, do laundry, etc. There is nothing wrong with her doing that.

If the percentage of alcohol in perfume is very little, we say that it does not matter, and a person may use them without any concern, such as if the alcohol content is 5% or less. This does not matter.
If the percentage of alcohol in perfume is very high, so that you can detect it, then it is better not to use it except where it is necessary, such as for sterilizing wounds and the like.
In cases where it is not necessary, it is better not to use it, but we do not say that it is haram. The most we can say is that this high alcohol content is an intoxicant, and no doubt consuming intoxicants is haram according to the texts of Islam and the consensus of the scholars, but is using it in ways other than drinking it permissible?
This is open to speculation, but to be on the safe side we should not use it. If you say that it is open to speculation because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling, al-ansab [animals that are sacrificed on stone altars for idols], and al-azlam [arrows for seeking luck or decision], are an abomination of Shaytan’s handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful. Shaytan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from al-salah (the prayer). So will you not then abstain?” [al-Maidah 5:90-91], then we look at the general meaning of the phrase ‘So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination), and say that alcohol should be avoided in all cases, whether it is drunk or applied to the skin, or used in some other way. 
If we look at the reason why, Allah says, “Shaytan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from the prayer. So will you not then abstain?” 
We may understand this to mean that only drinking it is forbidden , because applying it to the skin does not lead to that (enmity and hatred, etc.).
So, in conclusion, we say that if the percentage of alcohol in this perfume is low, there is no need to worry about using it, but if it is high, then it is better to avoid it unless it is for a need, such as sterilizing wounds and the like.

1377,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1377,Meaning of taghanni (‘reciting in a melodious voice’) in Qur’aan recitation,I have heard that there are ahaadeeth which indicate that it is allowed to recite the Qur’aan in a melodious voice (taghanni). How are we to understand these ahaadeeth?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Reciting in a melodious voice (taghanni) may mean:
1 – Making the voice beautiful when reciting, whilst reciting aloud in a tone that conveys the feelings of humility, softening of the heart and sadness, without making too much effort or exaggerating.
Taghanni means reciting aloud, as it was narrated in Saheeh Muslim that Abu Hurayrah said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Allaah does not listen to anything (more approvingly) than He listens to a Prophet reciting the Qur’aan aloud in a melodious voice…”  This indicates that we are commanded and encouraged to make our voices beautiful when reciting Qur’aan.
This hadeeth clearly states the meaning of taghanni. The phrase “reciting aloud” explains it. Reciting aloud means raising one’s voice when reciting and making it beautiful, in a natural manner with no artifice, which one enjoys and finds pleasure in. Before the Qur’aan was revealed, the Arabs used to sing hudaa’ (songs of camel drivers) when riding camels, to make the journey pass more quickly when they were sitting in their saddles, and so on.
But when the Qur’aan was revealed, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted to make them focus on the Qur’aan and raise their voices and make them beautiful when reciting it. He wanted that to take the place of singing, whilst paying attention to the correctness of the recitation. So in place of the pleasure of singing, they were given the pleasure of reciting Qur’aan, just as everything forbidden was replaced with something that was better for them. So istikhaarah was prescribed in place of seeking decisions from azlaam (arrows for divination) and marriage in place of fornication, and so on.
2 – It may be that what is meant by taghanni is that which resembles singing and music, and impressing others with the tune, without understanding and without any humility, as mentioned in the hadeeth which describes the Signs of the Hour.
3 – It is unlikely that taghanni means being content with the Qur’aan alone and having no need of people, because the meaning is different and is linguistically unacceptable.
This making the voice melodious in recitation should be done in a natural manner, not by means of teaching and training according to the rules of music.
Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned that reciting Qur’aan with a tune and in a melodious voice, if it is done naturally with no exaggeration or special teaching or training, then it is permissible. If extra effort is added to the natural tone to make it more beautiful, such as when Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari said to the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “If I had known (you were listening), I would have made it more beautiful for you,” then that is OK. But if the reciting in a melodious voice is done in an artificial manner, with special training and musical rhythms, this is something which the salaf despised, and which they criticized and condemned. It is known that the salaf used to recite the Qur’aan in a sad tone, making their voices beautiful and giving it a sad tone sometimes and a joyful tone sometimes. This is something natural.
Defining the meaning of making the voice melodious (taghanni)
(a)I say: there is no dispute concerning the validity of the fatwa of Imaam Maalik which is based on the hadeeth of the Signs of the Hour, with its various isnaads, and which states that it is not permitted to recite with a musical tune and following the rules of music in a manner that goes beyond the limits of recitation and correct pronunciation, and does not befit the dignity of the Qur’aan.
(b)The ahaadeeth of Anas and Abu Dharr (may Allaah be pleased with them both) refer to the recitation of the Khawaarij, who used to recite the Qur’aan throughout the night and day, but it did not go any deeper than their throats or collar bones, because they did not have knowledge of the Sunnah which clarifies matters, so they were deprived of proper understanding and the reward for recitation. In the ahaadeeth it says that they would exit from the religion like an arrow passing through its target. The ahaadeeth contain the command to kill them and says that they are the most evil of creation, even though you would think that your prayer and your recitation are as nothing when compared with their prayer and recitation.  This is the description of the Khawaarij and those who are like them. Ibn Taymiyah said: the hadeeth about the Khawaarij is saheeh in ten different isnaads, which were narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh, and some of which were narrated by al-Bukhaari. The Khawaarij used to denounce the Muslims as kaafirs merely for committing sins, but they were the followers of bid’ah (innovations) and misinterpretations who had split away from the mainstream of the ummah. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound in our religious commitment and their worldly affairs.
This is a description which applies only to the Khawaarij and those who are like them. The reciters nowadays are not like this as far as we know.
(c)The fatwa of Imaam Ahmad has to do with distorting the letters and exaggerating elongated vowels, which results from altering the letters and elongating them too much, which takes the recitation beyond what is correct. This fatwa states that it is emphatically disliked, as al-Qaadi Abu Ya’laa said. This refers to someone who goes to extremes and whose recitation is not correct, because he adds letters, such as adding waw and alif to the word Muhammad, making it Moohaamad. This is haraam, according to consensus. At the time of Imaam Ahmad, the people used to sing poetry and elongate the letters however they wished. Ishaaq al-Mawsili criticized Ibraaheem ibn al-Mahdi for doing that, because he distorted the words from the way they should be in Arabic.
And denouncing that in the case of reciting Qur’aan in a melodious voice is more essential, and this problem does not exist nowadays, praise be to Allaah.
(d)Ibn Taymiyah said: the kind of tune which the scholars regard as makrooh for reciting Qur’aan in is that which involves shortening long letters, lengthening short letters, giving a vowel to a silent letter, or making a vowelled letter silent, in order to make it fit the rules of music. If that also involves changing the way the Qur’aan should be recited and elongating the vowels, then this is haraam.
Reconciling between the evidence which says it is forbidden and the evidence which says it is allowed
There is no contradiction between the evidence which says it is forbidden and the evidence which says it is allowed if the prohibition applies to that which goes beyond the limits of correct recitation, whether by adding or taking away, or by neglecting an obligatory rule, or by going against the well-established rules of recitation. 
The prohibition also applies to that which is recited according to the rules of music, even if it is without the accompaniment of instruments, to make the voice tremble or quaver, or exaggerating in going along with a particular musical key which is in the reciter’s mind whilst he is reciting.
The permission applies only to that which is in accordance with the rules of sound recitation whilst making the voice beautiful. 
If what is meant by giving a tune is adding or taking away anything, or going against the well-established rules of recitation, this is haraam. If I mean making the voice melodious in recitation (taghanni), in order to make the listener feel happy or sad, or to soften his heart or to make the recitation attractive whilst also pondering the meanings and reflecting humility, then it is mustahabb, so long as it does not distort the meaning or change the pronunciation, or follow the rules of music.
Al-Suyooti said: Reciting Qur’aan with a tune and with beautiful, quavering voices, so long as it does not deviate from the correct way of reciting, is a good way (Sunnah hasanah); if it does deviate from the correct way of reciting, then it is haraam and is an evil deed. 
And he said in Sharh al-Risaalah:
From the comments of the imams it may be understood that making the voice beautiful whilst paying attention to the rules of music and also following the rules of recitation is an area that is subject to scholarly dispute.
Some of the scholars said that this is different from the way of the salaf, because the reader may neglect to recite properly, so they said that this was not permitted, in order to prevent the means that may lead to something haraam. 
But making the voice beautiful whilst reciting Qur’aan, without paying attention to the rules of music is what is required, and there is no dispute concerning this.
Ibn Qudaamah said: the scholars are agreed that it is mustahabb to read Qur’aan with a sad tone, with a measured pace and with a beautiful voice.
I say: this is taken from the hadeeth of Buraydah, “Recite the Qur’aan in a sad tone for it was revealed with sadness.” And the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas: “The best of people in reciting Qur’aan is the one who recites it in a sad tone.” But these hadeeths are both da’eef (weak) and the first one is da’eef jiddan (very weak).","al-Da’wah magazine, issue #1798 , p.44"

    Messenger of Allaah, should we not learn it?' He said, 'Of course, whoever hears it should
    learn it.'"" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad; this is a saheeh hadeeth).
    The Names of Allaah mentioned in the Qur'aan and Sunnah number over one hundred, as
    several scholars have agreed (see Al-Qawaa'id al-Muthlaa fi Sifaat
    Allaahi wa Asmaa'ihi by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn 'Uthaymeen). 
Among these are ninety-nine
    names which, if one learns them and acts in accordance with them, will bring a great
    reward, as is indicated in the hadeeth narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased
    with him), in which the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    said: ""Allaah has ninety-nine names, one hundred less one; whoever learns them will
    enter Paradise."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 2736)
    The learning referred to in the hadeeth includes the following:
Memorizing them.

Understanding their meanings.

Acting upon them: so if a person learns
        that Allaah is al-Ahad (the One and Only), he will not associate anything else with Him;
        if he learns that He is al-Razzaaq (the Provider), he will not seek provision from anyone
        else; if he learns that He is al-Raheem (the Most Merciful), he will not despair of His
        Mercy, and so on.

Calling upon Allaah by these Names, as He
        says (interpretation of the meaning): ""And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong
        to Allaah, so call on Him by them"" [al-A'raaf 7:180] - so one might say
        ""Yaa Rahmaan arhamni (O Most Merciful, have mercy on me),"" ""Yaa Ghafoor
        ighfir li (O All-Forgiving, forgive me),"" ""Yaa Tawwaab, tubb 'alayya (O Accepter
        of Repentance, turn towards me in forgiveness),"" and so on.

If you pay attention to the
    endings of many aayaat, you will find many of the names of Allah mentioned there. And

1393,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1393,All the followers of the various sects of the this Ummah will be    in Hell apart from one,"I would be very grateful if you could advise me on the fundamental differences between the main sects of Islam, although I know that originally Islam was a unified religion.
Thankyou.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The answer to your question is lengthy and deserves a book to itself. We cannot answer in details here, but we can say the following in brief:
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us beforehand that this Ummah would be divided as the previous nations were divided, as stated in the saheeh hadeeth:
Wahb ibn Baqiyyah told us from Khaalid from Muhammad ibn ‘Amr from Abu Salamah from Abu Hurayrah who said: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Jews were divided into seventy-one or seventy-two sects, and the Christians were divided into seventy-one or seventy-two sects, and my Ummah will be divided into seventy-three sects.” This was narrated by Abu Dawood in his Sunan, Kitaab al-Sunnah, Baab Sharh al-Sunnah.
It was reported from ‘Awf ibn Maalik who said: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Jews were divided into seventy-one sects, one of which is in Paradise and seventy are in the Fire. The Christians were divided into seventy-two sects, seventy-one of which are in the Fire and one is in Paradise. By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, my Ummah will be divided into seventy-three sects, one of which will be in Paradise and seventy-two will be in the Fire.” It was said, O Messenger of Allaah, who are they? He said, “Al-Jamaa’ah.”
Sunan Ibn Maajah, no. 3982.
What is meant by al-Jamaa’ah is the ‘aqeedah and actions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his Companions.
Among the sects that claim to belong to Islam are those who are misguided with regard to the Unity of Allaah (Tawheed) and His Names and Attributes; they say that everything that exists is Allaah and that He is incarnate or present in His creation – glorified be He far above what they say. On the contrary, He is above His heavens, settled on His throne, distinct from His creation.
Others are misguided with regard to eeman (faith) and say that deeds are separate from faith and that faith does not increase or decrease. The correct view is that faith consists of words and deeds; it increases when one does acts of obedience to Allaah and decreases when one commits sin.
Others are misguided by their declaring that the person who commits sin goes beyond the pale of Islam and is doomed to eternity in the Fire. The correct view is that the one who commits a major sin – apart from shirk and al-kufr al-akbar – does not go out of Islam.
Others are misguided with regard to the issue of al-qadaa’ wa’l-qadar (divine decree), and said that man has no choice in what he does. The correct view is that man has freedom of will on the basis of which he will be called to account and will bear the consequences of his deeds.
Others are misguided with regard to the Qur’aan, and say that it is created. The correct view is that it is the words of Allaah, revealed not created.
Others are misguided with regard to the Sahaabah, whom they revile and denounce as kaafirs even though they are the companions of the Prophet among whom the Wahy (Revelation) was revealed, and they are the most knowledgeable and the most devoted in worship among this Ummah, and they strove in jihaad for the sake of Allaah and Allaah supported this religion through them – may Allaah be pleased with them all.
And there are other groups who deviated from the path of Islam and innovated matters in the religion of Allaah; each of them rejoices in what they have, but they have followed the ways of the Shaytaan and gone against the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning):
“And verily, this is My straight path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His path. This He has ordained for you that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)” [al-An’aam 6:153]
We ask Allaah to make us among the followers of the Sunnah who will be saved from the Fire, and to admit us to Paradise among the righteous. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

1396,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1396,Can Zakat Al-Fitr Be Paid in Money?,"What do you give for Zakat Al-fitr? Is it money or grain? And what about if you don't know anybody to be given? Is it permissible to give it to the Masjid or a Kafir homeless, or Kair in general?","Zakat Al-Fitr must be given in food, not money, so we must adhere to what has been recorded in the Sunnah.","Can Zakat Al-Fitr be paid in money?


Can you give Zakat Al-Fitr to non-Muslims?","Praise be to Allah.Can Zakat Al-Fitr be paid in money?
Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made giving a Sa` of dates or a Sa` of barley as Zakat Al-Fitr an obligation for all Muslims, slave and free, male and female, young and old, and ordered that it should be given before the people went out to pray (Salat Al-`Eid) .” (Al-Bukhari, 1503)
Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “We used to pay as Zakat Al-Fitr a Sa` of food or a Sa` of barley (which was their food at that time) or a Sa` or dates or a Sa` of dried yoghurt or a Sa` of raisins.” (Al-Bukhari, 1506)
From this, it is clear that Zakat Al-Fitr must be food, not money, so we must adhere to what has been recorded in the Sunnah. So give one Sa` of whatever is the staple food in your country, such as rice or wheat, for example, on behalf of yourself and each member of your household. (A Sa` is equivalent to approximately 3 kilograms). 
Can you give Zakat Al-Fitr to non-Muslims?
It is not permissible to give it to anyone except a needy Muslim . If you cannot find anyone in your own country, you can delegate someone else to give it on your behalf in another country. May Allah help us and you to do the duties that He loves.

1397,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1397,Will Allah Accept Good Deeds If One Commits Zina?,"Will Allah accept the prayer and good deeds of a person who is continually committing sin such as fortification even though in his/her heart the person is aware that he/she is sinning and is full of guilt and tries his/her very best not to continue committing such sin. Except for this weakness this person tries to be a good muslim e.g. never misses daily prayers, giving out time and money towards the cause of Allah, never taking alcohol or other un-halal foods etc.","Allah will accept whatever righteous deeds from one who commits Zina, such as praying, fasting, giving charity etc., and He will also accept his sincere repentance.","Will Allah accept your good deeds if you commit Zina?


Punishment for Zina 


Punishment for Zina in Al-Barzakh","Praise be to Allah.Praise be to Allah.
Will Allah accept your good deeds if you commit Zina?
Allah will accept whatever righteous deeds from one who commits Zina , such as praying, fasting, giving charity etc., and He will also accept his repentance , as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and forgives sins, and He knows what you do.” [Ash-Shu`ra’ 42:25]
But there is the condition that his repentance must be sincere . Does this person truly regret what he has done? Is he indeed determined not to repeat the sin? Has he, I wonder, gotten rid of everything that may lead him to sin, such as relationships, addresses, telephone numbers, going to evil places, bad friends, movies, pictures and so on? What we believe is that if this person truly repents, he will give up this sin.
Zina is one of the worst kinds of immoral deeds. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And come not near to the unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a Fahishah [i.e., anything that transgresses its limits, a great sin], and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allah forgives him).” [Al-Isra’ 17:32]
Punishment for Zina 
Married people who commit Zina (adultery) are to be punished with the worst and most severe form of punishment , which is to be stoned to death, so that every part of their bodies may feel pain just as they felt pleasure in a prohibited manner even though they were not without a halal source of pleasure (i.e., within marriage). 
Unmarried people who commit Zina, and had never been married before, are to be given the maximum number of lashes prescribed in Shari`ah, which is one hundred lashes. In addition, they are subjected to the humiliation of having their punishment witnessed by a group of believers, and are to be banished for one full year from their city, the place where they committed the crime.
Punishment for Zina in Al-Barzakh
The punishment for those who are guilty of Zina in Al-Barzakh (i.e., after death and before the Day of Resurrection) is that they will be in an oven, the top of which is narrow and the bottom of which is wide. A fire will be lit under it, and they will be naked in (that oven). When the fire is lit, they will scream and rise up until they almost come out of the oven, then when the fire subsides, they will go back down into it. This is what will keep happening to them until the Hour begins. So how will their punishment be in the Fire of Hell itself?

    for guidance of someone close","what would be a good du'a or ayah to

    person. This is what the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did, as
    is reported in a number of ahadeeth, such as the following:
Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that Tufayl ibn
    Amr al-Dawsi and his companions came to the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allaah, Daws have rebelled and
    disobeyed, so pray to Allaah against them. People said, Now Daws are
    doomed! He said, O Allaah, guide Daws and bring them here. (Reported
    by al-Bukhaari, 2937).
    Abu Hurayrah said: I was calling my mother to
    Islam, when she was still a mushrik. One day I called her to Islam and she said something
    about the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that upset
    me. I came to the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him),
    weeping, and said: O Messenger of Allaah, I was calling my mother to Islam and she
    refused. Today I called her and she said something about you that upset me. Pray to Allaah
    to guide the mother of Abu Hurayrah. So the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: O Allaah, guide the mother of Abu
    Hurayrah. I left, feeling hopeful because of the Prophets prayer. When I got
    home, as I came near to the door I saw it was ajar. My mother heard my footsteps and said,
    Stay where you are, Abu Hurayrah! I could hear the sound of water. She washed
    herself, got dressed and put on her khimaar (head covering). Then she opened the door and
    said, O Abu Hurayrah, I bear witness that there is no god except Allaah, and I bear
    witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger. I went back to the Messenger of
    Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), weeping with joy, and said,
    O Messenger of Allaah, good news! Allaah has answered your prayer and has guided the
    mother of Abu Hurayrah. He praised and thanked Allaah, and said, That is
    good. I said, O Messenger of Allaah, pray to Allaah to make my mother and me
    dear to His believing slaves, and to make them dear to us. The Messenger of Allaah
    
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, O Allaah, make this slave of
    Yours (meaning Abu Hurayrah) and his mother dear to Your believing slaves, and make the
    believers dear to them. There is no believer who hears of me or sees me, but he
    loves me. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4546).
    Jaabir said: They said, O Messenger of
    Allaah, we have suffered much from the arrows of Thaqeef (this was when they were
    fighting, before they became Muslim), so pray to Allaah against them. He said,
    O Allaah, guide Thaqeef. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said: this
    is a hasan saheeh ghareeb hadeeth. Sunan al-Tirmidhi, no. 3877).
