52606,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/52606,Did the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) give a waqf to Tameem al-Daari in Palestine?,"I heard that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave al-Khaleel (“Hebron”) in Palestine as a waqf to Banu Tameem, and that he wrote a document to that effect for them, and that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab was one of those who witnessed it, and that they still live in al-Khaleel and are insisting on their rights to this waqf. Is this true, even though Palestine at that time was not under Muslim rule?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      It says in a number of reports that the Prophet  (peace 
      and blessings of Allaah be upon him) allocated Bayt Habroon or al-Khaleel 
      to Tameem al-Daari. 

    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    Tameem ibn Aws ibn Khaarijah Abu Ruqayyah al-Daari moved to 
    Greater Syria after the assassination of ‘Uthmaan and he settled in Bayt 
    al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). He converted in the year 9 AH. 

    Ya’qoob ibn Sufyaan said: He did not have any sons, but he 
    had a daughter called Ruqayyah. 

    It was narrated from several sources that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had allocated Bayt Habroon to 
    him. 

    Tahdheeb al-Tahdheeb, 1/449 

    It says in Mu’jam al-Buldaan (2/212): 
Habroon is the name of a 
    town in which is located the grave of Ibraaheem al-Khaleel (peace be upon 
    him) in Palestine. It is now known as al-Khaleel. 

    Tameem al-Daari came with his people to the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and asked him to allocate 
    Habroon to him, and he responded and wrote a document for him, which says: 

    In the name of Allaah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. 
    This is what Muhammad the Messenger of Allaah has given to Tameem al-Daari 
    and his companions. I give to you Bayt ‘Aynoon, Habroon, al-Martoom and Bayt 
    Ibraaheem and all that is in them; I give that to them and to their 
    descendents for ever and ever. Whoever disputes with them concerning that is 
    offending Allaah. Witnessed by Abu Bakr ibn Abi Quhaafah, ‘Umar, ‘Uthmaan 
    and ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib. End quote. 

    At that time Palestine was not under Muslim control, rather 
    it was ruled by the Byzantines. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) was allocating it for after Allaah enabled (the Muslims) 
    to conquer it. So in this way the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) was foretelling that it would be conquered. 

    When it was conquered during the reign of ‘Umar, he fulfilled 
    the promise of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) and Tameem gave it as a waqf to his descendents. This was the 
    first Islamic waqf ever in Palestine. Al-Maqdisi says in his book Ahsan 
    al-Taqaaseem fi Ma’rifat al-Aqaaleem: 
… There is a permanent 
    guest-house with bakers, cooks and servants, which offers lentils in olive 
    oil to every pilgrim or visitor who passes through the city of al-Khaleel. 
    This hospitality and food is provided by the waqf of Tameem al-Daari (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him). 

    Al-Qalqashandi said: 

    Al-Hamadaani said: The city of al-Khaleel is populated by 
    Bani Tameem al-Daari (may Allaah be pleased with him), in whose possession 
    is the document which was written by the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) to Tameem and his brothers, allocating to them Bayt 
    Habroon which is the town of al-Khaleel and some of its outskirts.

52631,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/52631,Is it permissible to read books that speak about intercourse for one who is about to get married?,"Is it permissible for a person who is about to get married for the first time to read some books in order to learn how to be intimate with his wife, so long as the books do not contain any pictures?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There are many reservations about reading books in order to find out how to have intercourse, such as the following: 
1.It may provoke desires in you that you cannot fulfil in any permissible way. This is a problem that is not farfetched, especially for one who does not have a wife to turn to.
2.Most of these books teach perverse forms of intercourse. Some of them go against the fitrah and sound human nature and others go against sharee’ah, such as anal intercourse.
3.Reading about these kinds of intercourse may put a man off his wife who does not do these kinds of actions well, and he may become attached to those things and the people who do them.
4.Reading these books may make you want to know more, and the devils among mankind and the jinn may lead you to read books which contain pictures, and you will end up doing something that is against sharee’ah.
5.Reading them encourages you to buy them, which helps to propagate them and encourages the printing of more editions.
6.There is no guarantee that these books will not fall into the hands of people who will be encouraged by them to do haraam actions. Your situation as one who wants to learn as a preparation for marriage is not like that of others who may get their hands on these books.
Moreover, Allaah has created in the male an inclination towards the female; having intercourse with a woman is not something complicated that needs a lot of explanation. A man will know what to do instinctively. If he needs any help the way to get this information is usually from the closest of people to him, or the most sincere among brothers who are already married. Hence there is no need for these books. 
And there may be other reservations. Hence we do not think that you should read these kinds of books. That does not mean that you should not learn about the permissible way of having intercourse. But what we have mentioned is that you should not read what has been written by those who are far removed from Islam, good taste and a sound human nature. 
You can read about married life and intercourse in the context of shar’i rulings and advice, that is free of the reservations we have referred to, on this site under the heading of “Married life.” This is in the category on Marriage.
