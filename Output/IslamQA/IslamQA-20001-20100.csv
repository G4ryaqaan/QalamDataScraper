          the graves of righteous and evil people alike, not only on the graves

20002,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20002,Is it permissible to live with a husband who takes out a riba-based loan?,Is it sinful for a wife to live with a husband who takes out loan to start a business? Can this be a ground for divorce?  I would be grateful if you could advice me in how to convience him that it is wrong what he is doing.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If the loan that he has asked for is halaal, i.e. it is not 
    based on riba, and he intends to pay it back, then there is nothing wrong 
    with this, and this is not regarded as a sinful loan. 

    But if this loan is a riba-based loan, then it is haraam and 
    it is not permissible for him to take it or to start a business with this 
    haraam money. 

    “And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He 
    will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).

     And He will provide him from (sources) he never could 
    imagine”

    [al-Talaaq 65:2-3]

    and :

    “Whoever gives up something for the sake of Allaah, Allaah 
    will compensate him with something better than that.” 

    If you want to advise him, then in Question no. 
    9054 you will 
    find some comments on this topic which you can give him so that he might 
    benefit from that, and avoid that which is haraam.  

    With regard to his consuming riba, this may be grounds for 
    you to ask him for a divorce (talaaq) or to ask for khula’, but you do not 
    have to do that, rather it is o.k. for you to stay with him and live with 
    him whilst continuing to advise him to do that which is better, especially 
    if there is the hope that he will mend his ways. 

    With regard to eating from his money, if he has a permissible 
    source of income other than this, then there is no sin on you or on you 
    children if you eat from this money. But if all his earnings are haraam and 
    you cannot find any other source of maintenance, and you have no other 
    halaal source of income, then it is permissible for you to take just what 
    you need, and no more, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you 
    can”

    [al-Taghaabun 64:16]

    So in this case if you take money, you are taking what he is 
    obliged to spend on you. But you should still continue to advise him and 
    tell him to refrain from taking haraam loans, and to look for a way that is 
    acceptable according to sharee’ah, so that he can do work and earn his 
    provision thereby.

    Yes, it is obligatory for a Muslim woman to strive to

    a little. Or she should put aside some time for reading and then the rest of 
    her time will be for her daily work. In this way she will not be neglecting 
    learning and she will not be neglecting her work and children and leaving 
    them to a servant to look after.

20005,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20005,There is no specific du’aa’ to be recited before reading Qur’aan,Is there any specific duaa before reading / memorizing the Quran? Do we have to have wudu to touch the Quran? And must we cover our aurah (i.e the whole body inc. head cover for women) before we can read the Quran? Or can she just dress accordingly in her normal house clothes without the head cover?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    There is no specific du’aa’ mentioned in the Qur’aan or 
    Sunnah, or in the reliable books of du’aa’s and dhikr, or in the opinions of 
    the reputable scholars, that is to be recited before reading or memorizing 
    Qur’aan. Rather what is prescribed is to seek refuge with Allaah from the 
    accursed Shaytaan before reading, because Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “So when you want to recite the Qur’aan, seek refuge with 
    Allaah from Shaytaan (Satan), the outcast (the cursed one)”

    [al-Nahl 16:98]

    If a person makes du’aa’ at any time, asking Allaah to make 
    it easy for him to memorize Qur’aan or to enable him to understand what he 
    has learned by heart, or any appropriate du’aa’ that he wants to say, 
    without adhering to a particular time for reciting this du’aa’, then there 
    is nothing wrong with that. 

    With regard to the obligation of having wudoo’ before 
    touching the Qur’aan, you will find the answer to this question under 
    question no. 10672. 

    It is not necessary to cover the parts of the body that you 
    cover in prayer in order to read Qur’aan, so it is o.k. to read Qur’aan 
    wearing regular clothes, without covering the head. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in his discussion on sujood 
    al-tilaawah (prostration required when reading certain aayahs of the 
    Qur’aan): “Sujood al-tilaawah should be done as soon as one reads it in the 
    Qur’aan, so it is o.k. to do sujood in any condition, even bareheaded etc., 
    because this prostration does not come under the same rulings as prayer.” 
    (1/249) 

    From his words it may be understood that there is nothing 
    wrong with a woman reading Qur’aan with her head uncovered, because she will 
    only read an aayah where a prostration is required when she is reading 
    Qur’aan, so she will be reading it with her head uncovered. The Shaykh did 
    not explain to us whether her head may be uncovered when reading Qur’aan.
    We advise you to strive to venerate and respect the Qur’aan, and read it with care, focusing on the meanings, at any time and in any circumstances, whatever is easy for you. The fuqaha’ stated that it is o.k. to read Qur’aan in all circumstances, standing or sitting, sitting cross-legged or otherwise, lying down, riding or walking, because of the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) who said: “The Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to lie down with his head in my lap when I was menstruating, and he would recite Qur’aan.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 297; Muslim, 301.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
20009,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20009,Is It Mandatory in Islam to Wash Used Sanitary Pads Before Throwing Them?,It is the practice of my fellow Muslim women friends to wash their feminine pads used during menses before they would throw them away. Is it true that it is obligatory to do so even though we are using disposable feminine pads which we are not going to use again? A lot of cases of hysteria and other disturbances are being said to be caused by not washing the pads properly before throwing them away by those afflicted. They say that the devil of the jinn likes to eat menses blood left on unwashed pads and would then harm the one who didn’t wash it.,"None of the trustworthy scholars have stated that a woman has to wash her feminine pads which may have traces of menstrual blood, if she is going to throw them away and not use them again.",,"Praise be to Allah.None of the trustworthy scholars have stated that a woman has to wash her feminine rags or pads which may have traces of menstrual blood, if she is going to throw them away and not use them again. Rather it seems that the female Companions did not wash these pads; the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) knew about that and it is not narrated that he told them off for that. 
At-Tirmidhi (61) and other authors of Sunan narrated that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “It was said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, should I do Wudu’ from the well of Buda`ah?’ – which was a well into which were thrown menstrual rags, the flesh of dogs and other putrid things. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Water is pure and nothing makes it impure.” This is an authentic Hadith which was classed as such by Ahmad, Yahya ibn Ma`in, Ibn Khuzaymah, Ibn Taymiyah and others (may Allah have mercy on them). 
What is referred to here by “menstrual rags” is the rags which were used for menstrual blood, as Al-Mubarakfuri (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on this Hadith. So it seems that they used to throw them away when they were contaminated with blood, otherwise the Companions would not have raised the issue of whether the water into which these rags were thrown was pure or not. 
There is no sound basis for what your friends have said; rather it is a myth which has no basis. Such notions are widespread among the common folk, so you have to ask for proof and evidence, and refer to the scholars and books of knowledge. You have to reject these myths and warn people against them. Each person must protect himself against the evils of the devils among mankind and the jinn by remembering Allah a great deal (Dhikr), reciting Quran and adhering steadfastly to the commands of Shari`ah, and keeping away from myths and stories that have no proof.

20011,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20011,Using the word “create” in relation to anyone other than Allaah,"Many muslims use the word 'create' for human biengs, e.g 'he has a creative mind ' or 'He or she created this or that. Even some very good muslims are using this word in their books. The only creator is Allah ,so is it right to use this word for human biengs",,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly Allaah is the Only Creator. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Is there any creator other than Allaah who provides for you from the sky (rain) and the earth?” [Faatir: 35:3]
 But the word khalaqa (create) has been used in reference to others apart from Allaah, for example in the verse (interpretation of the meaning);
“So Blessed is Allaah, the Best of creators”
[al-Mu’minoon 23:14]
 And in al-Saheehayn it is narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that on the Day of Resurrection it will be said to the image-makers, “Bring to life that which you have created!”
 When the word khalaqa (create) is used in reference to Allaah, it means bringing something into existence from nothing. This is what no one else is able to do besides Allaah. But when the word khalaqa is used in reference to man, it means transforming something from one shape into another.
 If it is used with reference to someone other than Allaah, saying that he creates in the sense that he changes a thing from one shape into another, then this is correct.

20013,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20013,Making up prayers at times when prayer is disallowed,People say that no kada(due)prayer can be offered immediaely after the 'Asr' prayer. Please help by giving me a comprehensive answer regarding this saying.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly – there are some times at which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) disallowed prayer. These are: 
1 – From after Fajr prayer until the sun has appeared and risen to the height of a spear, i.e., approximately fifteen minutes. (al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/162). 
2 – The time when the sun is at its zenith in the middle of the sky. This is a short time before the time for Zuhr prayer begins, approximately one-quarter of an hour or twenty minutes. (Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 11/286). Some of the scholars said that it was shorter than that. Ibn Qaasim (may Allah have mercy on him) said that it is a brief time period, not even long enough to pray, only enough to say the takbeer to start the prayer. (Haashiyat Ibn Qaasim ‘ala’l-Rawd al-Murabba’, 2/245) 
3 – After ‘Asr prayer until the sun sets. 
These three times were mentioned in many ahaadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade praying at these times. These ahaadeeth include the following: 
1 – Al-Bukhaari (586) and Muslim (728) narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘There is no prayer after ‘Asr prayer until the sun has set, and no prayer after Fajr prayer until the sun has risen.’” 
2 – Muslim (832) narrated that ‘Amr ibn ‘Abasah al-Sulami (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I said, ‘O Prophet of Allah, tell me what Allah has taught you and I do not know, tell me about the prayer.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Pray Subh (Fajr) prayer, then do not pray until the sun has appeared and risen… then pray for your prayer is witnessed and attended (by the angels), until the shadow of a spear points due north  – which is the time when the sun is in the middle of the sky – then stop praying, for at that time Hell is stoked up. When the shadow turns – which is the beginning of the time for Zuhr – then pray, for your prayer is witnessed and attended (by the angels), until you pray ‘Asr. Then stop praying until the sun sets…” 
Secondly: what is meant by making up prayers (qada’) is doing the prayer after the time for that prayer is over. The made-up prayer may be either fard (obligatory) or naafil (supererogatory). 
Fard prayers: The Muslims must pray regularly at the times defined by Allah for each prayer. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, As‑Salaah (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours”[al-Nisa’ 4:103]
Delaying the prayer until its time is over without a reason or excuse is haraam, and it is a major sin. 
If the Muslim has an excuse, such as sleeping or forgetting, and he was not able to do the prayer on time, then he must make up the prayer when that reason no longer applies, even if that is at one of the times when prayer is disallowed. This is the view of the majority of scholars. See al-Mughni, 2/515. 
The evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Whoever sleeps and misses the prayer or forgets it, let him pray it when he remembers.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 597; Muslim, 684) 
Naafil prayers: the scholars differed with regard to making them up at times when prayer is disallowed. The correct view is that they should be made up. This is the view of al-Shaafa’i (may Allah have mercy on him). See al-Majmoo’, 4/170. It was also the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), as stated in al-Fatawa, 23/127. This is indicated by a number of ahaadeeth, such as: 
The report narrated by al-Bukhaari (1233) and Muslim (834) from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed two rak’ahs after ‘Asr, and she asked him about that. He said: “Some people from ‘Abd al-Qays came to me and distracted me from praying two rak’ahs after Zuhr, so I did them now.” 
Ibn Maajah (1154) narrated that Qays ibn ‘Amr said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw a man praying two rak'ahs after he had prayed Fajr prayer. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Are you praying Fajr twice?” The man said to him, “I did not pray the two rak’ahs that come before it, so I prayed them now.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) remained silent. This was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah (984). Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) remained silent indicates that it is permissible. (al-Mughni, 2/532).

20015,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20015,Ruling on circumcision,"What is the ruling on circumcision? What is the ruling on what some people do, where they flay the penis or the pubic area?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Circumcision is one of the 
          characteristics of the fitrah (the natural state of man), and it is 
          one of the symbols of the Muslims, because it is narrated in al-Saheehayn 
          that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger 
          of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘The (characteristics 
          of) the fitrah are five: circumcision, shaving the pubic hair, trimming 
          the moustache, cutting the fingernails and plucking the armpit hairs.’” 
          So he 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) started with circumcision 
          and said that it is one of the characteristics of the fitrah.  
          
Circumcision as prescribed 
          by Islam involves cutting the foreskin covering the glans of the penis 
          only. Those who flay the skin surrounding the penis or flay the entire 
          penis, as is done in some savage countries, and claim in their ignorance 
          that this is the circumcision prescribed in Islam, this is nothing but 
          something prescribed by the Shaytaan and made attractive to the ignorant, 
          and it is a torment to the one who is circumcised. It goes against the 
          Sunnah of Muhammad 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the Islamic sharee’ah 
          which is based on ease and which enjoins preservation of life.  
          
It is haraam for a number 
          of reasons, including the following:  
1-The Sunnah mentions cutting off the foreskin covering the glans 
          of the penis only. 
2-This is torture and mutilation, and the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade mutilation and torture 
          of dumb beasts, committing outrages upon them or cutting off their limbs. 
          It is more appropriate that tormenting the sons of Adam should be more 
          forbidden, and a more serious sin. 
3-This is contrary to the humanity and kindness encouraged by the 
          Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he said, “Allaah has 
          decreed humanity in all things.” 
4-This may lead to disease or death of the one who is circumcised, 
          and that is not permissible because Allaah says (interpretation of the 
          meaning):  
“and do not throw 
          yourselves into destruction” 
[al-Baqarah 2:195]  
“And do not kill 
          yourselves (nor kill one another)” 
[al-Nisa’ 4:29]  
Hence the scholars stated that it is not obligatory 
          to circumcise an adult if there is the fear of any of these things happening 
          to him.  
With regard to bringing 
          men and women together on a certain day to attend the circumcision and 
          parade the child uncovered in front of them, this is haraam, because 
          it involves uncovering the ‘awrah which Islam dictates should be covered, 
          and forbade us to uncover it.  
Similarly, mixing between 
          men and women on this occasion is not permitted, because of the fitnah 
          (temptation) involved and because it goes against the pure sharee’ah.","Kitaab Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol 4, p. 423"

Permission to join prayers is broader than permission to shorten them, because shortening them is allowed only to travelers , but both travelers and non-travellers are permitted to join prayers when it will be difficult to perform the second prayer, whether on time or in congregation.
Based on this, it is permissible for you to bring `Asr forward and pray it with Zuhr in your home city, if you think it most likely that you will not be able to pray it on time because of travelling. 
If the airport is outside your city, you can pray in the airport and shorten your prayers. If you live near the airport, then you can join the prayers but you cannot shorten them . 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymهn (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
Question: 
If a person is in Qasهm and goes out to the airport, can he shorten his prayers in the airport? 
Answer: 
“Yes, he may shorten his prayers, because he has left the built-up area of his town, and all the villages that are around the airport are separate from the town. But if a person lives near the airport, he should not shorten his prayer, because he has not yet left the built-up area of his town.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/514) 
Ibn ‘Abbas said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed Zuhr and `Asr together in Madinah, at a time when there was no fear and he was not travelling. Abu’l-Zubayr said: I asked Sa’id [i.e., ibn Jubayr], Why did he do that? He said, I asked Ibn 'Abbas the same question, and he said, He did not want anyone among his ummah to suffer hardship. (Narrated by Muslim, 705) 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
“The specific reason for shortening the prayers is travelling, and it is not permissible to shorten prayers when not travelling. With regard to joining prayers , the reason for it is if there is a need or an excuse. So if a person needs to do so, he may join prayers whilst travelling , whether he is travelling a long distance or a short one, and he may join prayers because of rain etc., or because of sickness etc., or for any other reason, because the point is to spare the Muslims any difficulty or hardship.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 22/293; published by King Fahd Complex)

Is `aqiqah obligatory on the poor?


What takes priority; hajj or `aqiqah?","Praise be to Allah.Is Aqiqah Obligatory? 
There is a difference of scholarly opinion concerning the ruling on `aqiqah , with there being three different views. Some say that it is obligatory, some say that it is mustahabb (recommended) and some say that it is Sunnah mu’akkadah (a confirmed Sunnah). The latter is the most correct view. 
The Scholars of the Standing Committee said: 
“`Aqiqah is Sunnah mu’akkadah . For a boy two sheep which meet the conditions for sacrifice should be slaughtered, and for a girl one sheep. The sheep should be slaughtered on the seventh day, but if it is delayed it is permissible to slaughter them at any time, and there is no sin in delaying it, but it is better to do it as soon as possible.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 11/439) 
Is `aqiqah obligatory on the poor?
But there is no difference of opinion that `aqiqah is not obligatory for one who is poor, let alone one who is in debt. Something that is more important than `aqiqah – such as Hajj for example – does not take precedence over paying off debts. 
So `aqiqah is not obligatory for you, because of your husband’s financial circumstances.

“If the situation is as you described and you are not well off, and your income is only sufficient to cover your spending on yourself and those under your care, then there is nothing wrong with you not doing the `aqiqah for your children, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.” [Al-Baqarah 2:286] 
“and [Allah] has not laid upon you in religion any hardship.” [Al-Hajj 22:78] 
“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.” [Al-Taghabun 64:16]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If you are commanded to do a thing, do as much of it as you can; and if you are forbidden to do something then avoid it.” So whenever you can afford it then it is prescribed for you to do it.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 11/436, 437) 
The scholars of the Standing Committee were also asked: 
A man had a number of sons and he did not do `aqiqah for them, because he was poor. A few years later, Allah made him independent of means by His Bounty. Does he have to do `aqiqah? 
They replied: 
“If the situation is as described, then it is prescribed for him to do `aqiqah for them, two sheep for each boy.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 11/441, 442) 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin was asked: 
A man has a number of sons and daughters, and he did not do `aqiqah for any of them, either because of ignorance or carelessness. Some of them are grown up now. What should he do now? 
He replied: 
“If he does `aqiqah for them now, that will be good, if he was ignorant of the ruling or if he kept saying, “I will do `aqiqah tomorrow” until too much time had gone by. But if he was poor at the time when `aqiqah was prescribed, then he does not have to do anything.” (Liqa al-Bab al-Maftuh, 2/17-18) 
His family do not have to do the slaughtering on his behalf, even though that is permissible, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did the `aqiqah for his grandsons al-Hasan and al-Husayn, as narrated by Abu Dawud (2841) and al-Nasai (4219), and classed as sahih by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 2466. 
What takes priority; hajj or `aqiqah?
If you have to choose between Hajj and `aqiqah, then priority should definitely be given to Hajj. If you want to do `aqiqah for your children, that is permissible even if they are grown up. You do not have to tell the people whom you invite that this is an `aqiqah , and it is not permissible for them to make fun of what you are doing, because what you are doing is the right thing. It is not essential to cook the meat and invite the people, rather it is permissible to distribute the meat raw .  
The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 
“`Aqiqah refers to the animal sacrificed on the seventh day after birth as an act of thanksgiving to Allah for the blessing of a child, whether male or female. It is Sunnah, because of the hadiths that have been narrated concerning that. The person who does `aqiqah for his child has to invite people to come and eat it, in his house or wherever, or he can distribute the meat raw or cooked to the poor and to his relatives, neighbours, friends, etc.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 11/442)

Qunut: Before or after Ruku’?


Is prayer with a longer Qunut the best?","Praise be to Allah.What is Qunut?
Qunut, according to the definition of the fuqaha, “is the name of a du’a (supplication) offered during prayer at a specific point while standing.” 
When should Qunut be recited?
It is prescribed in the Witr prayer after the ruku’ (bowing), according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions. 
If a calamity (nazilah) befalls the Muslims , it is prescribed to say Du’a al- Qunut after standing up from ruku’ in the last rak’ah of each of the five daily obligatory prayers, until Allah relieves the Muslims of that calamity. (See Tashih al-Du’a by Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd, p. 460). 
Qunut in Fajr prayer all the time, in all circumstances: Valid?
With regard to saying Du’a al-Qunut in Fajr prayer all the time, in all circumstances, there is no sahih report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) singled out Fajr for Qunut, or that he always recited it in Fajr prayer. Rather what is proven is that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said Du’a al-Qunut at times of calamity with words that were appropriate to the situation . 
He said Du’a al-Qunut in Fajr and in other prayers, praying against Ra’l, Dhakwan and ‘Usayyah for killing the Quran-readers whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had sent to them in order to teach them their religion. 
And it was proven that he prayed in Fajr prayer and other prayers for the weak and oppressed believers, that Allah would save them from their enemies. But he did not do that all the time. The Rightly-Guided khalifas after him followed the same practice. 
It is better for the imam to limit Qunut to times of calamity, following the example of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as it was proven that Abu Malik al-Ash’ari said: “I said to my father, ‘O my father, you prayed behind the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and behind Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthman and ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with them). Did they say Du’a al-Qunut in Fajr?’ He said, ‘O my son, this is a newly-invented matter.’” (Narrated by the five, apart from Abu Dawud; classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Irwa, 435). The best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
And Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and Companions. (al-Lajnah al-Daimah li’l-Buhuth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Ifta, 7/47) 
Is there a specific wording for Qunut?
If you ask, is there a specific wording for Qunut during Witr prayer, or Qunut at times of calamity? 
The answer is: for Du’a al-Qunut in Witr prayer a number of wordings have been narrated, including the following: 
1 – The version which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught to al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), which is: 
“Allaahumma ihdini fiman hadayta wa ‘afini fiman ‘afayta wa tawallani fiman tawallayta wa barik li fima a’tayta, wa qini sharra ma qadayta , fa innaka taqdi wa la yuqda ‘alayk, wa innahu la yadhillu man walayta wa la ya’izzu man ‘adayta, tabarakta Rabbana wa ta’alayta la manja minka illa ilayk
(O Allah, guide me among those whom You have guided, pardon me among those whom You have pardoned, turn to me in friendship among those on whom You have turned in friendship, and bless me in what You have bestowed, and save me from the evil of what You have decreed. For verily You decree and none can influence You; and he is not humiliated whom You have befriended, nor is he honoured who is Your enemy. Blessed are You, O Lord, and Exalted. There is no place of safety from You except with You).” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1213; al-Nasai, 1725; classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Irwa, 429). 
It was narrated from ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to say at the end of Witr: 
“Allahumma inni a’udhu bi ridaka min sakhatika wa bi mu’afatika min ‘uqubatika wa a’udhu bika minka, la uhsi thanaan ‘alayka anta kama athnayta ‘ala nafsika (O Allah, I seek refuge in Your pleasure from Your wrath and in Your forgiveness from Your punishment. I cannot praise You enough; You are as You have praised Yourself.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1727; classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Irwa, 430; Sahih Abi Dawud, 1282). 
Then he should send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as it was narrated that some of the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) – including Ubayy ibn Ka’b and Mu'adh al-Ansary (may Allah be pleased with them) – did that at the end of Qunut al-Witr. (See Tashih al-Du’a by Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd, p. 460). 
Qunut at times of calamity (Qunut al-Nazilah) 
When praying Qunut at the time of calamity , one should make supplication as is appropriate to the situation, as it was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed some Arab tribes who had betrayed his Companions and killed them, and he prayed for the weak and oppressed believers in Makkah, that Allah would save them.  It was narrated that ‘Umar prayed Qunut with the following words:
“Allahumma inna nasta’inuka wa numinu bika, wa natawakkalu ‘alayka wa nuthni ‘alayka al-khayr, wa la nakfuruka. Allahumma iyyaaka na’budu wa laka nusalli wa nasjudu, wa ilayka nas’a wa nahfid. Narju rahmataka wa nakhsha ‘adhabaka, inna ‘adhabaka al-jadd bil kuffari mulhaq. Allahumma ‘adhdhib il-kafarata ahl al-kitab alladhina yasudduna ‘an sabilika
(O Allah, verily we seek Your help, we believe in You, we put our trust in You and we praise You and we are not ungrateful to You. O Allah, You alone we worship and to You we pray and prostrate, for Your sake we strive. We hope for Your mercy and fear Your punishment, for Your punishment will certainly reach the disbelievers.  O Allah, punish the infidels of the People of the Book who are preventing others from following Your way).” (Narrated by al-Bayhaqi, 2/210; classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Irwa, 2/170. Al-Albani said: This was reported from ‘Umar concerning Qunut in Fajr, and it seems that this Qunut is Qunut al-Nazilah (Qunut at times of calamity) as is indicated by his praying against the kuffar). 
Other formula for Qunut 
If you ask, can we make du’a using words other than those mentioned here? 
The answer is: 
Yes, that is permissible. Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (3/497): “The correct view which was stated definitively by the majority of scholars is that there are no specific words, rather any du’aa’ may be said.” 
The version narrated from ‘Umar is not something that we have to follow, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not pray using these words, so there is nothing wrong with adding more to them. Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “There is nothing wrong with adding more to this, cursing the infidels and sending blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and praying for the Muslims.” (Qiyam Ramadan by al-Albani, 31). 
Qunut: Before or after Ruku’?
We still have an important question which is: should Du’a al-Qunut be said before ruku’ (bowing) or after? 
The answer is: Most of the ahadith and the opinion of most of the scholars state that Qunut comes after ruku’, but if you say Qunut before ruku’ that is acceptable. So you have the choice of doing ruku’ when you have finished reciting Quran, then standing up and saying “Rabbana wa laka al-hamd” then saying Qunut… or saying Qunut when you have finished reciting Quran, then saying “Allahu akbar” and bowing. Both of these were narrated in the Sunnah. (Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him), al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/64) 
Is prayer with a longer Qunut the best?
Note: The questioner says that the best prayer is that which has longer Qunut. Perhaps he is referring to the hadith narrated by Muslim (1257) from Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him), which says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of prayer is tool al-qunut (the longest in standing).”
 Al-Nawawi said: “What is meant by qunut here is the standing, according to the consensus of the scholars, as far as I know.”
 So the hadith is not referring to Qunut in the sense of the du’a said after standing up from ruku’, rather it is referring to standing for a long time.

Is kissing allowed while fasting?","Praise be to Allah.Is romance allowed during fasting?
There is nothing wrong with a man playing with his wife , or a wife with her husband, by saying words while fasting, on the condition that there is no danger of either of them climaxing.
If there is the danger that they may reach climax, as in the case of one who has strong desires and who fears that if he plays with his wife his fast may be broken by his ejaculating, then it is not permissible for him to do that, because he is exposing his fast to the risk of being broken. 
The same applies if he fears that he may emit prostatic fluid (madhiy). (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/390) 
Is kissing allowed while fasting?
The evidence that it is permissible to kiss and play with one’s wife , if one is sure that there is no risk of reaching climax, is the report narrated by al-Bukhari (1927) and Muslim (1106) from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to kiss and touch (his wives) while he was fasting, and he was the most in control of his desires.’” 
In Sahih Muslim (1108), it is narrated from `Amr ibn Salamah that he asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Can a fasting person kiss (his wife)?” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Ask her” – meaning Umm Salamah – and she told him that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do that. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “With regard to things other than kissing that may lead to intercourse, such as embracing and the like, we say that the ruling on them is the same as the ruling on kissing, and there is no difference between them.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/434) 
Based on the above, your simply saying to your husband, “I love you,” or his saying that to you, does not affect your fast.

Allaah has described His believing slaves as follows: 
“those who do not bear witness to falsehood, and if they pass by some evil play or evil talk, they pass by it with dignity”
[al-Furqaan 25:72 – interpretation of the meaning]
i.e., they do not attend places of evil or attend promiscuous and immoral gatherings, as was narrated from more than one of the Salaf. (Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 6/130). By refusing to go with him to these campgrounds where Allaah is disobeyed you are doing the right thing, because there should be no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator.

If they get used to that, doing such things will be no big deal to them after that, or at least they will not denounce them.

Punishment for drinking alcohol in Islam


Can wine-drinkers offer prayers and observe fasting?","Praise be to Allah.What Islam says about alcohol?
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al-Ansab, and Al-Azlam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytan’s (Satan’s) handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.” [al-Maidah 5:90]
In Sahih al-Bukhari (2295) and Sahih Muslim (86), Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one who commits zina is a believer at the moment when he is committing zina, and no one who drinks wine is a believer at the moment when he is drinking it, and no thief is a believer at the moment when he is stealing, and no robber is a believer at the moment when he is robbing and the people are looking on.” This means that such a person is not a believer in the sense of having complete faith, rather his faith is greatly lacking because of this evil action. 
It is also narrated in al-Bukhari (5147) and Muslim (3736) from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever drinks wine in this world and does not repent from that, he will be deprived of it in the Hereafter .” 
In Sunan Abi Dawud (3189), Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has cursed alcohol, the one who drinks it, the one who pours it, the one who sells it, the one who buys it, the one who squeezes it (squeezes the grapes, etc), the one for whom it is squeezed, the one who carries it and the one to whom it is carried.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 2/700) 
In Sunan al-Nasai (5570), Ibn al-Daylami said to ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr, “O ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr, did you hear the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say anything about wine?” He said, “Yes, I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, ‘If any man from among my ummah drinks wine, Allah will not accept his prayers for forty days.’” This was classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Silsilat al-Sahihah (709). What this means is that he will not be rewarded for them, but he is still obliged to pray; in fact he is obliged to do all the prayers. If he forsakes prayer during this time, he will be committing one of the worst of major sins, one which some of the scholars said amounts to kufr, Allah forbid. 
There are many ahadith and reports which state that alcohol is emphatically forbidden and that it is the mother of all evils; whoever falls into this sin, it will lead him into other evil actions. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound. 
Punishment for drinking alcohol in Islam
With regard to the punishment of the drinker in this world, the punishment is flogging, according to the consensus of the jurists, because of the report narrated by Muslim (3281) from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) flogged the one who had drunk wine with palm branches stripped of their leaves and with shoes. 
But there is some difference of opinion as to the number of lashes. The majority of scholars are of the view that it is eighty lashes for a free man and forty for others. 
They quoted as evidence the hadith of Anas quoted above, in which it says that a man who had drunk wine was brought to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he had him flogged forty times with two palm branches that had been stripped of their leaves. Abu Bakr also did likewise (during his caliphate). When ‘Umar was the caliph, he consulted the people and ‘Abd al-Rahman said, “The minimum punishment is eighty,” so that is what ‘Umar commanded. 
The Sahabah agreed with ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) and did not differ. 
The Council of Senior Scholars agreed that the punishment for one who drinks wine is the hadd punishment, which is eighty lashes. 
Some of the scholars – such as Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) and Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] in al-Ikhtiyarat – think that giving more than forty lashes is left to the discretion of the Muslim leader. So if he thinks that there is a need to give more than forty lashes, as happened at the time of ‘Umar, then he may make it eighty. And Allah knows best.” (Tawdih al-Ahkam, 5/330) 
Can wine-drinkers offer prayers and observe fasting?
With regard to the wine-drinker’s prayer and fasting , undoubtedly he is obliged to perform the prayers on time and to fast in Ramadan. If he neglects any of his prayers or fasts, then he is committing a major sin which is worse than the sin of drinking alcohol. 
If he drinks wine during the day in Ramadan, then he is committing two major sins: the first is breaking the fast during the day in Ramadan and the second is drinking alcohol.  He should note that if a Muslim falls into sin and is unable to repent because his faith is weak that does not justify him persisting in sin or failing to do acts of worship and being negligent concerning them. Rather he should do whatever he can of acts of worship and strive to give up the major sins that he is committing. 
We ask Allah to help us to avoid sins, both major and minor, for He is the All-Hearing, Ever Near.

Muslim (727) narrated that Ibn 'Abbas said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite ‘Say (O Muslims): “We believe in Allah and that which has been sent down to us…’ [al-Baqarah 2:136 – interpretation of the meaning] and ‘Come to a word that is just between us and you…’ [Al ‘Imran 3:64 – interpretation of the meaning] in the two rak`ahs of Fajr prayer.” This hadith indicates that it is permissible to recite part of a surah in a rak`ah. (Nayl al-Awtar, 2/255) 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us to recite a complete surah , and sometimes he would recite a complete surah over the two rak`ahs; or he would recite the first part of a surah. As for reciting the last part of a surah, or the middle part of a surah, it was not narrated that he did that; and as for reciting two surahs in one rak`ah, he would do that in nafil prayers, but it was not narrated that he did that in fard prayers.  The hadith of Ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him), “I know the pairs of surahs that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would recite in one rak`ah. He would recite Surat al-Rahman and Surat al-Najm in one rak`ah, or Surat al-Qamar and Surat al-Haqqah in one rak`ah, or Surat al-Tur and Surat al-Dhariyat in one rak`ah, or Surat al-Waqi’ah and Surat al-Qalam in one rak`ah.” This hadith indicates that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did that, but it does not specify whether he did it in fard (obligatory) prayers or nafil (supererogatory) prayers. The hadith may mean either. As for reciting one surah in two rak`ahs, he used to do that rarely. Abu Dawud narrated from a man from Juhaynah that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) reciting Surat al-Zalzalah in two rak`ahs of Fajr prayer, and he said: “I do not know whether the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forgot or did he do that deliberately?” (Zad al-Ma’ad, 1/214-215) 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“There is nothing wrong with a man reciting one verse from a surah in an obligatory prayer or in a nafl prayer. This may be understood from the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘So, recite you of the Qur’an as much as may be easy for you’ [al-Muzzammil 73:20]
But the Sunnah – which is preferable – is to recite a surah , and the best is to recite one surah in each rak`ah. If that is too difficult then it is acceptable to divide the surah between the two rak`ahs.” (al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 3/104)

20044,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20044,Can he delay Hajj because of problems with his wife?,"I am speaking on behalf of my brother. He is planning to do Hajj this year, but for the following reason he is confused about whether he should do so. Unfortunately he is on bad terms with his wife and they are not living together. He is living with his parents and she is living alone with their son. Since his marital problems remain unresolved-i.e. he has not divorced her and neither are they living happily together, he is unsure whether it is right for him to leave his problems unresolved and do Hajj. Could you please give some advice on the matter.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    When a Muslim is able to do Hajj, he should hasten to do it, 
    and it is not permissible for him to delay it for no reason, because the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Hasten to do 
    Hajj – i.e., the obligatory Hajj – for none of you knows what will happen to 
    him.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 2721; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in 
    al-Irwa’, 990). And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “Whoever wants to do Hajj, let him hasten to do so.” (Classed as hasan 
    by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 1524). 
What you have mentioned 
    about your brother’s problems is not a reason for delaying Hajj, because 
    Hajj will not prevent him from dealing with this problem, since it is within 
    his power to try to solve this problem and finish with it before he goes for 
    Hajj. His Hajj may be the means of his problem being solved, because of the 
    help from Allaah it may bring and the blessing (barakah) of Hajj and 
    obedience to Allaah. It may be that he will make du’aa’ during his Hajj with 
    regard to this matter, and Allaah will answer and relieve him of this 
    distress. 

    Moreover, our advice to your brother is that he should not 
    hasten to divorce his wife, rather he should take his time and not rush into 
    anything. For divorce is something that Allaah dislikes. 

    If the problem between him and his wife is because of 
    negligence on her part regarding one of the duties towards Allaah, such as 
    if she neglects to pray or is not chaste, etc, then he has to warn her and 
    remind her about Allaah, and call her to Allaah, and try to guide her to 
    obey Allaah. If she persists in not responding to him, then in that case 
    there is nothing to be gained by keeping her. 

    But if the problem between them is of the common type of 
    problems between spouses, and has to do with differences of opinion 
    concerning day to day life and household matters, etc., then he has to be 
    patient and treat her kindly, and try hard to correct what he thinks is 
    inappropriate. For Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “and live with them honourably. If you dislike them, it 
    may be that you dislike a thing and Allaah brings through it a great deal of 
    good”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:19]
The husband has to live 
    with his wife honourably and keep her company in a good way, refraining from 
    harming her, and treating her kindly. Living with her honourably also means 
    putting up with any annoyance that his wife may cause him, and he should 
    remember that he will have a great reward for that from Allaah. 

    A man may dislike his wife, but he keeps her out of obedience 
    to Allaah and treats her kindly, and then Allaah brings about a great deal 
    of good from that. He may be blessed with righteous children from her who 
    will benefit him in this world and in the Hereafter; or his dislike may be 
    taken away and replaced with love, as often happens. 

    The Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “No believing man should hate a believing woman; if he dislikes 
    one of her characteristics he will be pleased with another.” (Narrated by 
    Muslim, 1469). What this means is that it is not appropriate for a believing 
    man to hate a believing woman, because even if he finds some bad 
    characteristic in her for which he may dislike her, he will find another, 
    praiseworthy, characteristic for which he will love her, such as her being 
    chaste or kind or obedient, or some other good characteristic. The same is 
    true of all people, each person has some good attributes and some bad 
    attributes. As the poet said: 

    “Who is there that is pleasing in all his characteristics? It 
    is enough honour for a man’s faults to be few enough to count.” 

    The wise man is the one who weighs up both the good 
    characteristics and the bad. 

    Your brother should make a lot of du’aa’ in the places and at 
    the times when du’aa’ is especially encouraged, during Hajj and otherwise, 
    asking that Allaah may reconcile him with his wife and create love between 
    their hearts.

20045,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20045,Hajj is obligatory for women as it is for men,"In a talk recently, the speaker said that it is not fard for women to perform Hajj whereas it is only fard for men. Please could you state any ahadith or ayaah as evidence for this statement. If this statement is wrong, please could you also state the relevant ahadith/ayaah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Hajj is fard ‘ayn (an individual obligation) which every Muslim who is accountable and is able to do it must do once in a lifetime. It is one of the pillars of Islam, an obligation which is proven to be so in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and by scholarly consensus. 
1 – In the Qur’aan, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence); and whoever disbelieves [i.e. denies Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah), then he is a disbeliever of Allah], then Allah stands not in need of any of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists)” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:97]
This aayah clearly states that it is obligatory. When the Qur’aan says “a duty that mankind owes to Allah” this implies that it is obligatory and compulsory. This is the evidence that it is fard. Indeed, we find that the Qur’aan emphatically states that it is obligatory, in the phrase “and whoever disbelieves [i.e. denies Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah), then he is a disbeliever of Allah], then Allah stands not in need of any of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists).” Allah describes going against this obligation as kufr or disbelief. This context shows that failing to do Hajj is not the action of a Muslim, rather it is the action of a non-Muslim. 
2 – In the Sunnah, there is the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Islam is built on five (pillars): the testimony that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; establishing regular prayer; paying zakaah; fasting Ramadaan; and Hajj.”  
The phrase “Islam is built…” indicates that Hajj is one of the pillars of Islam. Muslim narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave a sermon and said to us: ‘O people, Allah has enjoined Hajj upon you so perform Hajj.’ A man said, ‘Every year, O Messenger of Allah?’ He did not answer until the man had asked it three times, then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘If I had said yes, it would have become obligatory and you are not able to do that.’” And there are so many ahaadeeth concerning that that it reaches the level of tawaatur which means that this obligation is something certain and definite.
 3 – With regard to ijmaa’ or scholarly consensus, the ummah is unanimously agreed that Hajj once in a lifetime is obligatory for the one who is able to do it. This is something which is well known and no Muslim has any excuse for not knowing it, and the one who denies it is a kaafir.

20047,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20047,Is Clapping Haram?,"I have heard many views that clapping is not permissible in Islam, for example, an applause when children are performing something or any other halal performance. Could you state whether this is true and which hadith relates to this?","Clapping is prescribed for women if something alarms them during prayer, or they are praying with the men and the imam makes a mistake in the prayer.",,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Clapping during parties is one of the actions of jahiliyyah. The least that can be said about it is that it is makruh (disliked), but the evidence suggests rather that it is haram, because the Muslims are not allowed to resemble the non-Muslims. Allah says describing the non-Muslims of Makkah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Their Salah (prayer) at the House (of Allah, i.e. the Ka‘bah at Makkah) was nothing but whistling and clapping of hands.” [Al-Anfal 8:35]
The Sunnah is, when the believer sees something that he likes or dislikes, to say ‘Subhan Allah (Glory be to Allah)’ or ‘Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great),’ as was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in many hadiths. 
Clapping is prescribed specifically for women if something alarms them during the prayer, or they are praying with the men and the imam makes a mistake in the prayer . In that case, they should draw his attention to that by clapping, whereas men should do so by saying ‘Subhan Allah’, as was narrated in the sahih Sunnah from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). From this, it may be known that clapping on the part of men implies imitation of non-Muslims and women, and all of that is forbidden. And Allah is the source of strength.” 
The Standing Committee was asked about men clapping when they play with children, or children clapping to encourage their classmates. 
They replied: 
“This clapping is not appropriate, and at the very least it is intensely makruh because this is one of the characteristics of the jahiliyyah, and because it is something that is done only by women, to draw attention to a mistake in the prayer. And Allah is the Source of strength.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, vol. 4, p. 332-333)
Children can be encouraged by saying ‘Allahu akbar’ if they do something that the watcher or listener likes, or one may use other suitable phrases, or raise one’s hands, or raise one’s voice in words of praise such as “Well done!” or “Excellent!” and so on.

Fasting on Friday when it coincides with ‘Arafah","Praise be to Allah.Fasting on Friday
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, ‘None of you should fast on a Friday unless he fasts the day before or the day after.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1849, Muslim, 1929) 
Muslim narrated in his Sahih that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Do not single out the night of Jumu’ah [i.e.Thursday night] from among other nights for praying qiyam al-layl, and do not single out Friday from among other days for fasting, unless it is a fast that one of you regularly observes.” (al-Siyam, 1930) 
In al-Sahih, Juwayriyah bint al-Harith (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered upon her on a Friday when she was fasting. He asked her, “Did you fast yesterday?” She said, “No.” He asked, “Are you going to fast tomorrow?” She said, “No.” He said, “Then break your fast.” Hammad ibn al-Ja’d said, “I heard Qatadah say, Abu Ayyub told me that Juwayriyah spoke to him and he told her to stop her fast and she did so.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, al-Sawm, 1850)
Ibn Qudamah said: “It is makruh to single out the day of Friday for fasting , unless that coincides with a fast which one usually observes, such as a person who fasts alternate days, and a day that he fasts coincides with Friday, or a person who has the habit of fasting on the first or last day of the month, or the middle day of the month.” (al-Mughni, vol. 3, p. 53) 
Al-Nawawi said: “Our companions (i.e. the Shafi’is) said: it is makruh to single out the day of Friday for fasting, but if one joins it with the day before or the day after, or it coincides with a day which he habitually fasts, or he vowed to fast the day that his sick loved one was cured, or the day So and So returns, and that day happens to be a Friday, then it is not makruh (al-Majmu’ Sharh al-Muhadhdhab, vol. 6, p. 479) 
Shaykh al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The Sunnah says that it is makruh to single out Rajab for fasting , and it is makruh to single out Friday (for fasting).” (al-Fatawa al-Kubra, vol. 6, p. 180) 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: “As for Friday, it is not Sunnah to fast on this day, and it is makruh to single it out for fasting.” (See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, vol. 6, p. 465) 
Fasting on Friday when it coincides with ‘Arafah
Excluded from this prohibition is one who fasts the day before or after, or if it coincides with days that he habitually fasts, such as one who fasts al-Ayyam al-Bid(the 13th, 14th and 15th of each hijri month),  or who has the habit of fasting a specific day such as the Day of ‘Arafah, and it coincides with a Friday . 
From this it may be understood that it is permissible for a person who has vowed to fast on the day when So and So returns, for example, or the day when So and So recovers from sickness, to observe that fast if that day happens to be a Friday. (See Fath al-Bari by Ibn Hajar). 
The same applies to one who has fasts to make up from Ramadan. “It is permissible for a Muslim to fast on a Friday to make up a day from Ramadan, even if he fasts the Friday on its own.” (Fatwa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, vol. 10, p. 347) 
Similarly, if ‘Ashura’ or Arafah coincides with a Friday, he may fast, because his intention is to fast ‘Ashura’ or ‘Arafah, not to fast on a Friday. And Allah is the Source of strength.

20051,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20051,Why is the witness of one man considered to be equal to the witness of two women?,Why is the witness of two women considered to be equal to the testimony of one man?,,,"Praise be to Allah.What is meant by witness 
          or testimony is something by which the thing testified may be proven 
          and known to be true and correct, so it is information about it.  
          With regard to the witness of two women being equal to the testimony 
          of one man. Allaah has mentioned the wisdom behind specifying the number 
          of two as being that a woman may forget or get confused, so the other 
          woman can remind her, as He said: 
“…And get two witnesses 
          out of your own men. And if there are not two men (available), then 
          a man and two women, such as you agree for witnesses, so that if one 
          of them (two women) errs, the other can remind her…”
[al-Baqarah 2:282 
          – interpretation of the meaning]
 
          With regard to the phrase, “that if one of them (two 
          women) errs”, Ibn Katheer said: “This means, the two women, if one 
          of them forgets the testimony, then ‘the other can remind her’, 
          i.e., she can remind her about the matter concerning which testimony 
          is being given.” (Tafseer Ibn Katheer, part 1, p. 724) 
 
          Allaah has commanded the testimony of two women so as 
          to be sure that they remember, because the mind and memory of two women 
          takes the place of the mind and memory of one man. (See I’laam al-Muwaqqa’een, 
          part 1, p. 75). 
 
          This does not mean that a woman does not understand or 
          that she cannot remember things, but she is weaker than man in these 
          aspects – usually. Scientific and specialized studies have shown that 
          men’s minds are more perfect than those of women, and reality and experience 
          bear witness to that. The books of knowledge are the best witness to 
          that; the knowledge which has been transmitted by men and the ahaadeeth 
          which have been memorized by men far outnumber those which have come 
          via women. 
 
          This has to do with gender, i.e., the gender of men is 
          more perfect than the gender of women. Allaah says (interpretation of 
          the meaning): 
 
          “Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, 
          because Allaah has made one of them to excel the other, and because 
          they spend (to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous 
          women are devoutly obedient (to Allaah and to their husbands), and guard 
          in the husband’s absence what Allaah orders them to guard (e.g. their 
          chastity and their husband’s property)”
 
          [al-Nisaa’ 4:34]
Nevertheless, there 
          are some women who are far superior to men in their reason and insight, 
          but they are few, and the ruling is based on the majority and the usual 
          cases. 
 
          A woman may compensate for her weaknesses by striving 
          hard, and surpass men when they are negligent. Hence we find that in 
          some colleges, female students surpass male students because of their 
          greater efforts and their keenness to succeed when many of the male 
          students are negligent and are not eager to learn. A man may also excel 
          over a woman in some fields that are basically hers, so we find that 
          some of the most skilled chefs, tailors, cosmeticians and obstetricians 
          on the international level are men. The point is that usually – and 
          no wise person would dispute this – most of the prominent people in 
          the religious sciences, such as fiqh, hadeeth, tafseer, ‘aqeedah and 
          preaching, and in the worldly sciences such as medicine, astronomy, 
          engineering, physics, chemistry, etc. are men. 
 
          If we think about the western societies in which men 
          and women are regarded as equal in all aspects, we will find that despite 
          that men still prevail. Still, Allaah has given women pre-eminence and 
          has favoured them over men in some aspects, such as caring for children, 
          and showing patience, love and compassion towards them, and managing 
          the home. Hence the sharee’ah gives custody to them, for the mother 
          is the first school, from which the future men, leaders of the world 
          and scholars of the ummah graduate. What virtue can be greater than 
          this?
 
          Islam encourages special care for the mother and her 
          children, and enjoins upon children to honour their mother, treat her 
          kindly and give her preferential treatment above the father. It was 
          narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: “A man said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, 
          who among the people is most deserving of my good companionship?’ He 
          said, Your mother, then your mother, then your mother, then your father, 
          then those who are closest in order of closeness.’” (Narrated by 
          Muslim, 2548). What greater honour can there be than this? 
 
          So let everyone work in his or her field of specialization. 
          Men should not interfere in pregnancy and breastfeeding, and women should 
          not be involved in jihad, fighting the enemy, or holding the positions 
          of khaleefah or ruler. Whatever is permitted to both of them should 
          be done within the guidelines of sharee’ah, such as not allowing free 
          mixing of the sexes and not neglecting other duties such as those of 
          husbands and wives.

    was said that the family of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah

    “Baarik ‘ala Muhammad wa ‘ala aali Muhammad (Send

4-we have shop of 4 million and we have some different assets of 1 million rs. having jeweellery worth one million rs.how much zakat we have to pay.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The Muslim does not have to pay zakaah on the 
    house in which he lives – even if there is more than one house – or on the car which he has for his own use – no matter how valuable it may be. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on 
    him) said:  

    There is no zakaah on houses if they are for living in… but with regard to land, houses, stores and the like that are prepared for sale, zakaah is 
    due on these according to their value each year when a full year has passed, regardless of whether their value has risen or fallen, if the owner 
    has firmly resolved to sell them. 
Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 
    14/173 
Secondly: 
There is no zakaah on shops and property used 
    for business themselves; there is no zakaah on land or buildings or on the furnishings and vessels in the store, no matter how much they are 
    worth, unless these things have been prepared for sale, in which case zakaah is due on them. This is what the scholars call zakaah on trade 
    goods. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on 
    him) said: 
The basic principle is that everything that 
    is prepared for sale is subject to zakaah, and things that are used in the shop are not subject to zakaah. 
Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah 
    li’l-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 14/183 

    The way in which the zakaah is worked out is: 
The value of the goods that are in the store 
    at the end of the year is worked out, then the zakaah is paid on them at a rate of one-quarter of one-tenth, i.e., 2.5 % of the value. See 
    question no. 26236. 
The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 
Trade goods are those which have been 
    prepared for sale and purchase of all kinds or property. Zakaah must be paid on them if their value reaches the nisaab of gold and silver, and the 
    owner took possession of them with the intention of trading them. Their value in gold and silver should be estimated at the end of the year, in 
    favour of the poor and needy. The basic principle concerning that is the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Spend of the good 
    things which you have (legally) earned”
    [al-Baqarah 2:267]
i.e., what you have earned by trade; this was 
    the view of Mujaahid and others. Al-Baydaawi and others said: Spend of the good things which you have earned, i.e., the obligatory zakaah. 
And Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“And those in whose wealth there is a 
    recognised right”
[al-Ma’aarij 70:24]
Trade comes under the general meaning of 
    wealth, so there is a due which the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) defined as being one-quarter of one-tenth. The wealth 
    of trade is the most important kind of wealth, so it is more apt that it be included in the meaning of this aayah than any other kind of wealth. 
    It was narrated that Samurah ibn Jundub (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) used to command us to pay zakaah on that which we had prepared for sale.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood) 
‘Umar said to Hamaas, “Pay the zakaah on your 
    wealth.” He said, ‘I only have some quivers and leather.” He said, “Estimate how much they are worth and pay the zakaah.” Imam Ahmad (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) quoted this story as evidence. 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah 
    be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “With regard to Khaalid, you have been 
    unfair to Khaalid, because he is keeping his shields and weapons for the purpose of jihaad.” (Agreed upon). Al-Nawawi and others said: This 
    indicates that it is obligatory to pay zakaah on trade goods, otherwise the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would not 
    have explained Khaalid’s excuse.  
Al-Bukhaari and Muslim narrated a marfoo’ 
    report from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) in which it says: “The Muslim does not have to pay zakaah on his slave or his horse.”  
    Al-Nawawi and others said: This hadeeth is the basis of the view that there is no zakaah on wealth kept for personal use. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn 
    Baaz, Shaykh ‘Abd al-Razzaaq ‘Afeefi and Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Qa’ood. 
Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 
    9/186, 187 
Thirdly: 

    With regard to the jewellery that you own, if it is gold and silver then you have to pay zakaah on it at a rate of 2.5% if it reaches the nisaab; 
    the nisaab for gold is approximately 85 grams. 
If it something other than gold and silver – 
    such as rubies and coral – and it is worn as adornment, then there is no zakaah on it. If it is acquired for the purpose of trade, then zakaah 
    must be paid on it. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on 
    him) said: 
Gold is the thing on which zakaah is due; as 
    for precious stones and diamonds, no zakaah is due on them unless they are for trade purposes. 
Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah 
    li’l-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 14/121 

    The scholars of the Standing Committee said – in a fatwa that covers more than was mentioned in the question –  

    The fact that zakaah must be paid on coins – whether gold or silver – has been proven in the Qur’aan and Sunnah and by scholarly consensus. Trade 
    goods are not sought in and of themselves, rather what is sought through them is coins, whether gold or silver. Matters are judged according to 
    their purpose, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Actions are but by intentions.” Hence zakaah is not due 
    on a slave who is acquired as a servant, or on a horse that is acquired to be ridden, or on a house that is acquired to be lived in, or on a 
    garment that is acquired to be worn, or on chrysolite, rubies, coral etc that are acquired for use as adornments. But if all of these or similar 
    things are acquired for the purpose of trade, then zakaah must be paid on them, because the purpose behind them is to acquire gold and silver 
    coins or whatever is used in their place… Based on this, whoever withholds zakaah on whatever trade goods he has is sinning… 
Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 
    9/312, 313 
The questioner says, “And we have some 
    different assets of 1 million rs.” If these things are gold or silver, or prepared for sale, then zakaah is due on them; if what is referred to is 
    things that are used such as cars, furniture, etc, then there is no zakaah on them. 
In conclusion: 
The questioner should evaluate the products 
    that he has at the end of the year and add their value to whatever money, gold and silver he has, and then pay zakaah on the total amount, at a rate of one-quarter of one-tenth (2.5%).

20059,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20059,Causes of weakness of faith,I have some problems in Faith sometimes I know it is th eSataans. Can you give me some more stories that will give me more fairh.,,,"Praise be to Allah.A person may become negligent and that may lead to weakening his faith. The remedy for that is to pray a great deal for forgiveness and to constantly remember Allah, and to read Quran and focus on and ponder its meanings, for doing that will rid the heart of its carelessness and wake it from its slumber. And it is very important to do a lot of righteous deeds. 
There are several reasons for weakness of faith, including the following: 
1 – Ignorance of the names and attributes of Allah leads to weakness of faith because if a person is lacking in knowledge of the names and attributes of Allah, his faith will be imcomplete. 
2 – Neglecting to think of the signs of Allah in the universe and to ponder His commands and prohibitions. This causes a lack of faith or at the very least it makes faith stagnant and prevents it from growing. 
3 – Committing sin, for sin has a far-reaching effect on the heart and on faith. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No adulterer is a believer at the moment when he is committing adultery.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2475; Muslim, 57). 
4 – Failing to do acts of worship, for failing to do acts of worship diminishes faith. But if the act of worship is something that is obligatory and it is neglected with no excuse, then this is a shortcoming for which a person is to be blamed and will be punished. If it is an act of worship that is not obligatory or it is obligatory but a person does not do it because he has an excuse, then this is a shortcoming for which he will not be blamed or punished. 
Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il Fadeelat al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, 1/52 
We advise you to read Quran a great deal and ponder its verses, for in that there is healing for what is in your heart, if Allah wills. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We send down of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe”
[al-Isra’ 17:82]
We also advise you to study the stories of the Prophets, for Allah narrated them in the Quran to make the heart of his Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the believers with him, steadfast. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And all that We relate to you (O Muhammad) of the news of the Messengers is in order that We may make strong and firm your heart thereby. And in this (chapter of the Quran) has come to you the truth, as well as an admonition and a reminder for the believers” [Hood 11:120]

    Apostasy (riddah) means disbelieving after being Muslim. 
    There is no bad deed that cancels out all good deeds apart from apostasy. If 
    a person dies in a state of apostasy all his good deeds will be wiped out, 
    but if he returns to Islam, the reward for his good deeds will be restored 
    and he does not have to make up any prayers or fasts that he missed during 
    the period of his apostasy. 

    Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said: 

    With regard to apostasy from Islam, whereby a person becomes 
    a kaafir, whether a mushrik or a Jew or Christian, if he dies in that state 
    then all his good deeds will be wiped out, according to scholarly consensus, 
    as the Qur’aan says in more than one place. For example Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And whosoever of you turns back from his religion and 
    dies as a disbeliever, then his deeds will be lost in this life and in the 
    Hereafter”

    [al-Baqarah 2:217] 

    “And 
    whosoever disbelieves in Faith, [i.e. in the Oneness of Allaah and in all 
    the other Articles of Faith i.e. His (Allaah’s) Angels, His Holy Books, His 
    Messengers, the Day of Resurrection and Al-Qadar (Divine Preordainments)], 
    then fruitless is his work”

    [al-Maa’idah 5:5]

    that they used to do would have been of no benefit to them”

With regard to the shar’i 
    rulings on apostates, if the apostate does not return to Islam, he must be 
    executed. 

    It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood said: the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “It is not permissible to shed the blood of a Muslim who bears witness that 
    there is no god except Allaah and that I am the Messenger of Allaah except 
    in one of three cases: a soul for a soul (i.e., punishment for murder), a 
    married man or woman who commits adultery, and one who leaves his religion 
    and separates from the jamaa’ah (main body of Muslims).” 

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6484; Muslim, 1676 

    It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever 
    changes his religion, execute him.”  

    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6922). 

    Then if he is executed, he has died as a kaafir, so he is not 
    to be washed or shrouded; the funeral prayer is not to be offered for him, 
    and he is not to be buried in the Muslim graveyard. On the Day of 
    Resurrection he will be one of the people of Hell who will abide therein for 
    eternity. 

    The earth rejected the body of an apostate during the time of 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as a lesson 
    and a warning to the onlookers. 

    It was narrated that Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) 
    said: There was a Christian man who became Muslim. He used to recite 
    al-Baqarah and Aal ‘Imraan, and he used to write down (the revelation) for 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Then he 
    returned to Christianity and he used to say, “Muhammad knows nothing but 
    what I have written for him.” Then Allah caused him to die, and the people 
    buried him, but in the morning they saw that the earth had thrown his body 
    out. They said, “This is the doing of Muhammad and his companions. They dug 
    the grave of our companion and took his body out of it because he had run 
    away 

    from them.” They again dug the grave deeply for him, but in 
    the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They 
    said, “This is the doing of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave 
    of our companion and threw his body outside it, for he had run away from 
    them.” They dug the grave for him as deep as they could, but in the morning 
    they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. So they realized that 
    what had befallen him was not done by human beings and they had to leave him 
    thrown (on the ground).

It is not permissible for you to take the money of other people if they forget or make a mistake. What you have been given does not belong to you and it is not permissible for you to take it. If something is credited to your account by mistake or because of forgetfulness, it is not permissible for you to take it. This is indicated by all the evidence of sharee’ah.

“O you who believe! Eat not up your property among yourselves unjustly except it be a trade amongst you, by mutual consent”

Ahmad (94, 23) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for a man to take his brother’s wealth unlawfully.” That is because Allaah has forbidden the Muslim to take his fellow-Muslim’s wealth. 
According to a report narrated by Ibn Hibbaan (13/317): The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for a Muslim to take his brother’s stick without his consent.” Classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Ghaayat al-Muraam, 456.

Rights of children


 Rights of children before birth


Rights of children after birth","Praise be to Allah.Rights of wife 
These rights have been discussed in detail in the answer to question no. 10680  
Rights of children
Allah has given children rights over their parents just as the parents have rights over their children. 
Ibn ‘Umar said: “Allah has called them abrar (righteous) because they honoured (barru) their fathers and children. Just as your father has rights over you, so too your child has rights over you.” (Al-Adab al-Mufrad, 94) 
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, according to a hadith (prophetic narration) narrated by ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar, “… and your child has rights over you.” (Muslim, 1159)
 Rights of children before birth
The child’s rights over their parents include some that come even before the child is born, for example: 
·        Choosing a righteous wife to be a righteous mother. 
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A woman may be married for four reasons: her wealth, her lineage, her beauty and her religious commitment. Marry the one who is religiously committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4802; Muslim, 1466)
Shaykh ‘Abd al-Ghani al-Dahlawi said: “Choose from among women those who are religiously committed and righteous, and who are of good descent, for if a woman is of illegitimate descent, this bad characteristic may be passed to her children. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“The adulterer — fornicator marries not but an adulteress — fornicatress or a Mushrikah; and the adulteress –fornicatress, none marries her except an adulterer — fornicator or a Mushrik.” [al-Nur 24:3]
Rather Islam recommends compatibility for the purpose of harmony and to avoid a person being shamed if he marries into a family that is not compatible.” (Sharh Sunan Ibn Majah, 1/141)
Rights of children after birth
·        It is Sunnah (recommended) to do tahnik for the child when he is born: 
Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The son of Abu Talhah was sick. Abu Talhah went out and the child died, and when Abu Talhah returned he said, “What happened to my son?” Umm Sulaym (his wife) said, ‘He is quieter than he was.” Then she brought him his dinner and he ate, then he had marital relations with her, and when he finished she said, “They buried the child.” The following morning, Abu Talhah went to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him what had happened. He said, “Did you have marital relations last night?” He said, “Yes.” He said, “O Allah, bless them.” She later gave birth to a boy. Abu Talhah said to me, “Keep him until I bring him to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” He brought him to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and I sent some dates with him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took him and said, “Is there anything with him?” They said, “Yes, some dates.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took some and chewed it, then he took some from his mouth and put it in the child’s mouth (tahnik), and named him ‘Abd-Allah.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5153; Muslim, 2144) 
Al-Nawawi said: 
“The scholars are agreed that it is mustahabb (preferred) to do tahnik with dates for the child when he is born; if that is not possible then to use some similar kind of sweet. The dates should be chewed until they become soft enough to be swallowed, then the child’s mouth should be opened and a little of the dates put in his mouth.” (Sharh al-Nawawi ‘ala Muslim, 14/122-123)
·        The child should be given a good name , such as ‘Abd-Allah or ‘Abd al-Rahman. 
Nafi’ narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The most beloved of your names to Allah are ‘Abd-Allah and ‘Abd al-Rahman.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2132) 
It is mustahabb to give the child a Prophet’s name: 
Anas ibn Malik said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A child was born to me last night and I called him by the name of my father Ibrahim.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2315)
It is mustahabb to name the child on the seventh day, but there is nothing wrong with naming him on the day of his birth, because of the hadith quoted above. 
Samurah ibn Jundub narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every child is in pledge for (a sacrificial animal) which should be slaughtered for him on the seventh day, his head should be shaved and he should be named.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 2838; classed as sahih by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 4541) 
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
“The purpose of naming is to define the thing named, because if there is something whose name is unknown it is difficult to refer to it. So it is permissible to name him (the child) on the day he is born, and it is permissible to delay the naming until the third day, or until the day of the ‘aqiqah, or before or after that. The matter is broad in scope.” (Tuhfat al-Mawlud, p. 111) 
·        It is Sunnah to shave the child’s head on the seventh day and to give the weight of the hair in silver in charity. 
‘Ali ibn Abi Talib said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) slaughtered a sheep as the ‘aqiqah for al-Hasan, and he said, “O Fatimah, shave his head and give the weight of his hair in silver in charity.” So she weighed it and its weight was a dirham or part of a dirham. (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1519; classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 1226.)
·        It is mustahabb for the father to do the ‘aqiqah , as stated in the hadith quoted above, “Every child is in pledge for his ‘aqiqah.” 
Two sheep should be sacrificed for a boy and one for a girl. 
‘Aishah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded them (to sacrifice) two similar sheep for a boy and one for a girl. (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1513; Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 1221; Abu Dawud, 2834; al-Nasai, 4212; Ibn Majah, 3163)
·        Circumcision 
Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The fitrah (natural state) is five things, or five things are part of the fitrah: circumcision , shaving the pubic hairs, plucking the armpit hairs, clipping the nails and trimming the moustache.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5550; Muslim, 257)
·        The child’s rights with regard to education and upbringing 
‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Each of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. The ruler who is in charge of people is a shepherd and is responsible for them. The man is the shepherd of his household and is responsible for them. The woman is the shepherd of her husband’s house and child and is responsible for them. The slave is the shepherd of his master’s wealth and is responsible for it. Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2416; Muslim, 1829)
So parents must take care of teaching their children the duties of Islam and other virtues that are recommended in shari’ah, and worldly matters that they need in order to live a decent life in this world. 
The man should start by teaching them the most important things, then the next most important. So he starts by teaching them correct ‘aqidah (creed), free from shirk (polytheism) and bid’ah (innovation). Then he teaches them the acts of worship, especially prayer. Then he teaches them and trains them in good manners and characteristics, and everything that is good. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) when Luqman said to his son when he was advising him: “O my son! Join not in worship others with Allah. Verily, joining others in worship with Allah is a great Zulm (wrong) indeed.” [Luqman 31:13]
‘Abd al-Malik ibn al-Rabi’ ibn Sabrah narrated from his father that his grandfather said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Teach the child to pray when he is seven years old, and smack him (lightly) if he does not pray when he is ten.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 407; Abu Dawud, 494. Classed as sahih by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 4025)
Al-Rubayyi’ bint Mu’awwidh said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent word on the morning of Ashura to the areas where the Ansar lived (on the outskirts of Madinah), saying: Whoever did not fast this morning, let him not eat for the rest of the day, and whoever started fasting this morning, let him complete his fast. She said: We used to observe this fast after that, and we used to make our children fast and make them toys of wool; if one of them cried for food we would give him that toy until it was time to break the fast. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1859; Muslim, 1136) 
Al-Saib ibn Yazid said: “I was taken for Hajj with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when I was seven years old.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1759) 
·        Training in good manners and characteristics
Every father and mother should train their children in praiseworthy characteristics and good manners, whether towards Allah, His Prophet the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), towards the Quran and their ummah (global community of believers), and with everyone whom they know and who has rights over them. They should not behave badly with those whom they mix with, their neighbours or their friends. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
“The father must discipline his child and teach him what he needs to know about religious duties. This teaching is obligatory upon the father and all those in charge of children before the child reaches the age of adolescence. This was stated by al-Shafi’i and his companions. Al-Shafi’i and his companions said: This teaching is also obligatory upon the mother, if there is no father, because it is part of the child’s upbringing and they have a share of that and the wages for this teaching may be taken from the child’s own wealth. If the child has no wealth then the one who is obliged to spend on him may spend on his education, because it is one of the things that he needs. And Allah knows best.” (Sharh al-Nawawi ‘ala Sahih Muslim, 8/44) 
The father should bring them up with good manners in all things, eating, drinking, dressing, sleeping, going out of the house, entering the house, riding in vehicles, etc, and in all their affairs. He should instill in them the attributes of a good man, such as love of sacrifice, putting others first, helping others, chivalry and generosity. He should keep them away from evil characteristics such as cowardice, stinginess, lack of chivalry, lack of ambition, etc. 
Al-Manawi said: 
“Just as your parents have rights over you, so too your child has rights over you, rather many rights, such as teaching them the individual obligations, teaching them Islamic manners, giving them gifts equally, whether that is a gift, a waqf (endowment), or other gift. If preference is shown with no reason, that is regarded as invalid by some of the scholars and as makruh (disliked) by others.” (Fayd al-Qadir, 2/574) 
He must also protect his sons and daughters from everything that may bring them close to the Fire. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allah, but do that which they are commanded.” [al-Tahrim 66:6]
al-Qurtubi said: 
“Al-Hasan commented on this verse by saying: Command them and forbid them. One of the scholars said: (The phrase) Ward off (or protect) yourselves includes children, because the child is part of him, as it says in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “…nor on yourselves, if you eat from your houses…” [al-Nur 24:61], where the various relatives are not mentioned individually. So he should teach him what is halal (lawful) and what is haram (unlawful), and make him avoid sin, and teach him other rulings.” (Tafsir al-Qurtubi, 18/194-195) 
·        Spending
Spending is one of the father’s obligations towards his children; it is not permissible for him to fall short in that or to neglect this matter, rather he is obliged to do this duty in the fullest sense. 
‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is sufficient sin for a man if he neglects those on whom he is obliged to spend.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1692; classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 4481) 
·        Another of the greatest rights is to give the child a good upbringing and take good care of him or her – especially in the case of girls. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) encouraged this righteous deed. 
‘Aishah, the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), said: A woman came to me with two daughters and asked me for food, and I could not find anything except one date which I gave to her. She shared it between her two daughters, then she got up and went out. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came in and I told him what had happened. He said: “Whoever is in charge of any of these girls and treats them well, they will be a shield for him against the Fire.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5649; Muslim, 2629) 
·        Another important matter which is one of the rights of children to which attention must be paid, is treating children fairly. This right was referred to by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the sahih hadith (authentic narration): “Fear Allah and treat your children fairly.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2447; Muslim, 1623). It is not permissible to show preference to females over males, just as it is not permissible to show preference to males over females. If the father makes this mistake and shows preference to some of his children over others, and does not treat them fairly, this will lead to many evils, such as: 
The harm that befalls the father himself, for the children whom he denies or deprives will grow up to hate him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) referred to this in the hadith narrated by Muslim (1623) when he said to the father of al-Nu’man, “Would you like them to honour you equally?” He said, “Yes.” In other words, if you want them all to honour you equally, then be fair in giving gifts to them. 
Another evil consequence is the children hating one another, and stoking the flames of hatred and enmity between them.

With regard to the celebration of the marriage, announcing it and inviting people to a feast on this occasion as an expression of joy and to publicize the marriage, all of these are things which are mustahabb (encouraged) on the occasion of marriage. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Announce marriage.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 4/5; classed as saheeh by al-Haakim, 2/200; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 1072).

please sir, i beg you, tell me how practically can i get rid of this nasty desire.",,,"Praise be to Allah.we ask Allah to heal you quickly from this serious disease, and to cleanse your heart of all evil, for He is Able to do that. For the harm caused by falling into this great sin is not limited to punishment in the Hereafter, rather it goes beyond that and a part of the punishment may happen in this world; even if it is nothing more than the regret and feelings of guilt that result from it, that is enough, so how about if that is accompanied by incurable fatal diseases which the doctors are agreed are widespread among homosexuals and are caused by these perverted practices? You may find more information on that if you refer to question no. 10050. 
The way to deal with your problem is as follows: 
Firstly: 
You have to repent sincerely from your heart, turn to Allah, regret what you have done, and pray a great deal to Allah, asking Him to forgive you and help you to get rid of this problem. For Allah is most Generous and is Close and always Responsive. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say: ‘O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful’”
[al-Zumar 39:53]
So stand before Allah weeping, beseeching, expressing your need for Him and seeking His forgiveness, and receive the glad tidings from Allah of a way out and forgiveness. 
Secondly: 
Strive to plant the seeds of faith in your heart, for when they grow they will bear fruits of happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. 
Faith in Allah is what – after the help of Allah – protects a person from falling into haraam things. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No adulterer is a believer at the moment when he is committing adultery.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2475; Muslim, 57). So when faith is well established in your heart and fills your heart and emotions, you will not violate His sacred limits, in sha Allah. If the believer stumbles on one occasion he will quickly wake up. Allah describes His slaves as follows (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, those who are Al-Muttaqoon (the pious), when an evil thought comes to them from Shaytaan (Satan), they remember (Allah), and (indeed) they then see (aright)”
[al-A’raaf 7:201]
Thirdly: 
Try to follow the advice which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave to young people, which is to get married if you are able to. Do not pay any attention to the fact that you are young, for being young is not a reason not to get married, far from it, so long as you have the need to get married. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O young men, whoever among you can afford to get married, let him do so, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and protecting chastity. Whoever cannot afford that should fast, for it will be a shield for him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5065; Muslim, 1400). Strive to follow this advice from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), for this is the solution to your problem, in sha Allah. 
There is nothing wrong with telling your father and mother of your need and desire to get married; don’t let shyness stop you from doing that.
 Think seriously about marriage and do not fear poverty, and Allah will grant you independence of means by His bounty. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who has no wife and the woman who has no husband) and (also marry) the Saalihoon (pious, fit and capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid-servants (female slaves). If they be poor, Allah will enrich them out of His Bounty. And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures’ needs, All-Knowing (about the state of the people)”
[al-Noor 24:32]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has told us that the one who gets married with a good intention, Allah will help him. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three who are entitled to Allah’s help: the mujaahid who fights for the sake of Allah, the slave who made a contract of manumission with his master, wanting to buy his freedom, and the one who gets married, seeking chastity.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1655; al-Nasaa’i, 3120; Ibn Maajah, 2518; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb, 1917). 
Fourthly: 
If it is not easy for you to get married, then there is another solution, which is fasting. So why not think of fasting three days of each month, or on Mondays and Thursdays? 
How great is the reward of fasting. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that Allah said, “All the deeds of the son of Adam are for him except for fasting, which is for Me and I shall give reward for it.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1904; Muslim 1151). 
And Allah tells us that He has enjoined fasting on us so that we might become pious: 
“O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)”
[al-Baqarah 2:183]
Fasting – as well as offering protection from following whims and desires and bringing a great reward from Allah – also trains a person to have strong will, patience and forbearance, to rise above the desires and pleasures of the self. So hasten to fast so that Allah may make things easier for you. 
Fifthly: 
Beware of thinking little of looking at haraam things in cheap magazines and nude pictures which lead to committing immoral actions that doom a person to Hell, and have deep and bad effects on the heart – Allah  forbid. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts). That is purer for them. Verily, Allah is All-Aware of what they do”
[al-Noor 24:30]
You should note that if you think little of this evil, this gives the Shaytaan an opportunity to make other actions that lie beyond that seem attractive to you, which is obvious. But he will do that because you gave in to him, even if that only happened once.  
Sixthly: 
Remember, when the idea of sin come to you, or the Shaytaan whispers to you to commit a sin, that the parts of your body will bear witness against you on the Day of Resurrection for this sin. Do you not know that these limbs and this youthful energy are a blessing from Allah to you? So can it be an act of gratitude to Allah that you use them to disobey Allah and rebel against the commands of Allah? 
There is another matter which you should pay attention to. Read with me the following verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Till, when they reach it (Hell-fire), their hearing (ears) and their eyes and their skins will testify against them as to what they used to do.
 
 And they will say to their skins, ‘Why do you testify against us?’ They will say: ‘Allah has caused us to speak.’ He causes all things to speak, and He created you the first time, and to Him you are made to return”
[Fussilat 41:20-21] 
It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: “We were with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he smiled and said, ‘Do you know why I am smiling?’ We said, ‘Allah and His Messenger know best.’ He said, ‘Because of how a person will address his Lord. He will say, ‘O Lord, did You not guarantee me protection against injustice?’ He will say, ‘Yes.’ He will say, ‘I do not deem valid any witness against me but my own self.’ Allah will say, ‘Your own self will be sufficient as a witness against you this Day, and the honourable scribes (recording angels) will also bear witness.’ Then a seal will be placed over his mouth and it will be said to his limbs, ‘Speak!’ And they will speak of his deeds. Then he will be allowed to speak and will say, ‘Away with you! It was for your sake that I argued.’” (Narrated by Muslim, 2969). 
Seventhly:  
Avoid being alone, for this makes you think about your desires. Try to fill your time with things that will benefit you, such as doing righteous deeds, reading Qur’aan, dhikr and prayer. 
Eighthly: 
Avoid keeping company with evil and immoral people who discuss these subjects, talk about things that provoke desire, take the matter of sin lightly and encourage it. You have to look for good friends who will remind you of Allah and help you to obey Him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “A man will follow the religion of his close friend, so be careful about who you make friends with.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2378; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 1937). 
Ninthly: 
If it so happens that you fall into sin in a moment of weakness, do not persist in that, rather be quick to repent to Allah, lest you become one of those of whom Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who, when they have committed Faahishah (illegal sexual intercourse) or wronged themselves with evil, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins; — and none can forgive sins but Allah — and do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:135]
My brother, do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Beware of letting the Shaytaan have any power over you or letting him whisper to you that Allah will never forgive you. For Allah forgives all sins of those who repent to Him. 
I hope that Allah will help you and will make it easy for you to get out of this problem.

20069,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20069,Engagement according to sharee’ah,What is the concept of engagement in Islam. Usually an engagement party is one in which the fiance/fiancee exchange rings. Is this the prescribed method in the shariah?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Engagement according to sharee’ah means that the man asks the woman to marry him. The view of the scholars is that engagement is prescribed for one who wants to get married. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And there is no sin on you if you make a hint of betrothal…” [al-Baqarah 2:235]
and it was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) got engaged to ‘Aa’ishah. (Al-Bukhaari, al-Nikaah, 4793). And in al-Saheeh it also states that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) got engaged to Hafsah. (Al-Bukhaari, al-Nikaah, 4830). 
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) encouraged the one who wants to get engaged to look at the woman to whom he wishes to propose. According to the hadeeth, “When any one of you proposes marriage to a woman, if he can look at that which will encourage him to go ahead and marry her, then let him do so.” (Abu Dawood, al-Nikaah, 2082; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 1832). 
But in Islamic sharee’ah there are no specific practices that must be followed with regard to engagement. What some Muslims do, announcing the engagement, having a party to celebrate and exchanging gifts, all comes under the heading of customs which are permissible in principle, and none of them are haraam except those which sharee’ah indicates are haraam – which includes the exchange of rings between the engaged couple, a custom which is known in Arabic as “dublah.” This custom goes against sharee’ah for the following reasons: 
1 – Some people think that these rings increase the love between the spouses and have an effect on their relationship. This is an ignorant (jaahili) belief and is an attachment to something for which there is no basis in sharee’ah and which does not make sense.  
2 – This custom involves imitating the non-Muslims such as Christians and others. It is not a Muslim custom at all. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned us against that when he said, “You will inevitably follow the paths of those who came before you, handspan by handspan, cubit by cubit, until even if they entered the hole of a lizard, you will follow them.” We said, “O Messenger of Allah,  (do you mean) the Jews and Christians?” He said, “Who else?” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-I’tisaam bi’l-Kitaab wa’l-Sunnah, 6889; Muslim, al-‘Ilm, 6723). 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, al-Libaas, 4031; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 3401). 
3 – This engagement usually takes place before the ‘aqd (marriage contract), in which case it is not permissible for the man to put the ring on his fiancée’s hand himself, because she is still a stranger (non-mahram) to him, and has not yet become his wife. 
Finally, we will quote the words of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) on this matter: 
“ ‘Dublah’ is a word that refers to the engagement ring. In principle there is nothing wrong with rings (i.e., they are permissible), unless they are accompanied by certain beliefs, as some people do when the man writes his name on the ring that he gives to his fiancée, and the woman writes her name on the ring that she gives to her fiancé, believing that this will guarantee the bonds between the spouses. In this case this ‘dublah’ or engagement ring is haraam, because it represents an attachment to something for which there is no basis in sharee’ah and which does not make sense. Similarly it is not permissible for the man to put the ring on the woman’s hand himself, because she is not yet his wife, so she is still a stranger (i.e., non-mahram) to him; she is not his wife until after the marriage contract is done.”

Meaning of the descent of Allah to the lowest heaven


Refuting allegations about the meaning of descending","Praise be to Allah.Degree of the Hadith about the descent of Allah to the lowest heaven
This Hadith is authentic and it  is proven in the soundest two books after the Book of Allah. It was narrated by Al-Bukhari in his Sahih (1145) and by Muslim (1261) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Lord descends every night to the lowest heaven when one-third of the night remains and says: ‘Who will call upon Me, that I may answer Him? Who will ask of Me, that I may give him? Who will seek My forgiveness, that I may forgive him?’” 
This Hadith was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) by approximately twenty-eight of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) and the Ahl Al-Sunnah unanimously agreed that it is to be accepted. 
Meaning of the descent of Allah to the lowest heaven
It should be noted that the descent of the Lord – may He be Exalted – to the lowest heaven is one of the actions that are attributed to Him and has to do with His will and wisdom. It is descending in a real sense, in a manner that befits His Majesty and Might. Allah descends however He wills, whenever He wills. Glory be to Him, there is nothing like unto Him and He is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing. 
Refuting allegations about the meaning of descending
It is not permissible to distort the meaning of the Hadith by saying that what is meant is that His command or mercy descends, or that one of His angels descends. This is false for several reasons: 

This misinterpretation goes against the apparent meaning of the Hadith. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) attributed descent or the act of descending to Allah, and the basic principle is that a thing is attributed to the one who does it, so if it is attributed to someone else, that is a distortion that goes against this basic principle. 

We know that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the most knowledgeable of all people about Allah, and that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the most eloquent of mankind and the most truthful in what he says. There are no lies in his speech and it is impossible for him to attribute something to Allah that is not one of His names or attributes or actions or rulings. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And if he (Muhammad) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allah), We surely would have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might), And then We certainly would have cut off his life artery (aorta).” [Al-Haqqah 69:44-46] 
Moreover the only intention of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was to guide mankind, so if he said, “Our Lord descends” and someone else says something that runs contrary to the apparent meaning of these words, such as saying that His command descends, then we say: Do you have more knowledge about Allah than the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Our Lord descends” but you say His command descends. Or are you more sincere towards the ummah than he was, since he (allegedly) concealed what he was supposed to tell them and told them something different. Undoubtedly the person who tells the people one thing but means something else is not sincere towards them. Or do you think that you are more eloquent than the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)?! Undoubtedly such a misinterpretation implies that one is accusing the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) of some kind of shortcoming that a Muslim can never accept on the part of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).  

The descent of His command and mercy is not restricted to this part of the night, rather His command and mercy descend all the time. If it is said that what is meant is a specific command or specific mercy which does not happen all the time, the answer to that is that if we assume that this interpretation is correct, then the Hadith indicates that where the descent of this thing ends is in the lowest heaven, so what benefit can it be to us if mercy descend to the lowest heaven without reaching us? Why would the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) even tell us about it?
The Hadith indicates that the One Who descends says: “Who will call upon Me, that I may answer Him? Who will ask of Me, that I may give him? Who will seek My forgiveness, that I may forgive him?” No one can say that except Allah, may He be Exalted. (See: Majmu` Fatawa wa Rasa’il Ash-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin, 1/203-210)

Sometimes I ask myself why some of the people died with such tragic. Are they bad or what?
Hope your answer will help me feel better and live happily with my family.",,,"Praise be to Allah.My dear brother, how often we fail to look at things with a balanced view. How often we find problems in our daily lives that stem from the extremes of either concern or negligence. The one who seeks happiness and success in this world has to have a balanced approach without letting the one outweigh the other. In this manner he can strengthen his heart with faith and find peace of mind in doing that which he is required to do. What you are complaining of does not stem from ignorance of the root of the matter, rather it stems from the fact that you are focusing more on fear and the causes of fear and you are forgetting about being optimistic and not paying any attention to it. 
You know that death is an inevitable reality that will come to every living thing, and no one will be spared that, no matter how noble his status before Allah. Allah said to His Prophet, the noblest of all creation (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, you (O Muhammad) will die, and verily, they (too) will die”
[al-Zumar 39:30]
And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Everyone shall taste death. And only on the Day of Resurrection shall you be paid your wages in full. And whoever is removed away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise, he indeed is successful. The life of this world is only the enjoyment of deception (a deceiving thing)”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:185]
And the poet said: 
Every son of a female, no matter how long he lives,
Will one day be carried on the bier. 
The positive kind of fear of death is that which make a person check himself and watch himself, and bring himself to task for bad deeds. This fear is that which makes a man keep away from sin and persist in praying for forgiveness and repenting. As for the kind of fear that makes a person panic, expect the worst and feel helpless, and discourages him from taking any action and prevents him from doing his duties, this is a negative and blameworthy kind of fear. The one who feels this has to strive hard to rid himself of it and put a stop to it. Perhaps this is what the questioner is feeling, and he thinks that this waswasah (whisper from the Shaytaan) is a warning of danger and a sign that the end is near. But this is not the case. All it is, is a whisper from the accursed Shaytaan, to cause distress to the believer and to make his life a misery, and there is nothing real behind it. This is why, when you went to the hospital for tests, they showed that you are in good health, which should make you feel better and give you peace of mind. Perhaps we can help you by telling you how to get rid of this waswasah (whisper from the Shaytaan), in the following ways: 
1 – Firmly implanting in your heart the belief that whatever Allah wills happens, and whatever He does not will does not happen. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And you cannot will unless (it be) that Allah wills the Lord of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists)”
[al-Takweer 81:29]
Death is nothing but the decree of Allah which the son of Adam has no way of warding off or avoiding. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad ): ‘I have no power over any harm or profit to myself except what Allah may will. For every Ummah, there is a term appointed; when their term comes, neither can they delay it nor can they advance it an hour (or a moment)’”
[Yoonus 10:49] 
“Wheresoever you may be, death will overtake you even if you are in fortresses built up strong and high”
[al-Nisa’ 4:78] 
As this is the case, then fear of death will not delay it or bring it forward, all you will get from your fear of death is misery and worries. Your appointed time will never come until Allah wills it, at the time that is known to Him, and you can never bring it forward, whether you fear death or not, whether you think about how your end will be or not. This is contrary to the life of peace, stability and tranquility that Allah wants for the believers. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Whoever works righteousness — whether male or female — while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter)”
[al-Nahl 16:97]
2 – Remembering the kindness and mercy of Allah towards His believing slaves, for He is Loving, Compassionate and Forgiving, the One Whose mercy prevails over His wrath, Who blesses the sinner with abundant forgiveness. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Why should Allah punish you if you have thanked (Him) and have believed in Him. And Allah is Ever All‑Appreciative (of good), All‑Knowing”
[al-Nisa’ 4:147]
The believer is promised Paradise when he dies. There is nothing standing between him and Paradise but death. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no person who bears witness that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, but Allah will forbid him to the Fire.” (Narrated by Muslim, 47). 
3 – Always putting your trust in Allah in all your affairs, and knowing that this trust (tawakkul) will ward off the whispers of the Shaytaan and put an end to them. Once you have resolved to do that, then do not look back. If you feel that these whispers are overwhelming you again, then turn to Allah and seek refuge in Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytaan (Satan), then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He is All-Hearer, All-Knower”
[al-A’raaf 7:200]
4 – Lift your head high and look forward; start your daily life with steadfastness and certainty, and approach all your actions with energy and peace of mind. How many good things there are in this world that fill hearts with contentment and tranquility and fill the heart with hope and certain faith. 
With regard to your question, what is going to happen to you and your family in the future, 
Subhaan-Allah (glory be to Allah)! 
Are you the one who created them? Are you the one who grants them provision? Are you the one who is taking care of their needs? 
No, it is Allah Who does all that, Who is more merciful towards them than you are. Have complete trust that Allah will never cause them to be lost, may He be glorified and praised. This matter is not up to you at all. If all the people thought in this way no one would have any peace of mind. But praise be to Allah Who has guaranteed provision for everyone. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And no moving (living) creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allah. And He knows its dwelling place and its deposit (in the uterus or grave). All is in a Clear Book (Al‑Lawh Al‑Mahfooz — the Book of Decrees with Allah)”
[Hood 11:6]
So cast these thoughts away from your mind. 
5 – You should make a lot of du’aa’ asking Allah to dispel this waswaas (whispers from the Shaytaan) from you. Pray to Him with all humbleness, expressing your weakness and need of Him. And rest assured that He will certainly answer you. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright”
[al-Baqarah 2:186]
With regard to those who die as a result of accidents, the fact that they die in this manner does not mean that they are bad at all. Rather people who are counted among the righteous may die in this manner. Think about this hadeeth which will help you to resolve this matter. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The martyrs are five: those who are stabbed, those who die of a stomach disease, those who drown, those who are crushed by falling walls, and those who die in battle for the sake of Allah.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 615). 
Look at those who die by drowning, or by fire, or who are crushed by falling walls. Are these not frightening things? But that does not indicate that they are bad, rather the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called them martyrs (shuhada’), which is the utmost honour. The way in which a person dies does not indicate that he is bad, but Allah in His wisdom decrees that some people should die in this manner. Perhaps that is in order to raise them in status in Paradise, or to expiate for some of their sins, or for some other reason that we do not know.

Is buying a car on installments from a bank haram?","Praise be to Allah.Common forms of buying and selling by installments
The ruling on a thing is based on the way it is understood, so it is not possible to state whether this purchase is permissible or forbidden without studying the contract and its clauses. 
There are two common forms of buying and selling by installments (leasing): 

Where you buy a car from the owner, whether the owner is an individual or a company, on the basis that you will pay for it in installments. There is nothing wrong with this, even if the price in installments is higher than the price if paid for in cash. Please see question no. 13973 . 
Where you buy the car through a company or person who does not own it , rather they pay the price to the owner on your behalf, on the basis that you will pay off the price in installments with interest. This is haram, because what this contract means is that this company or bank is giving you an interest-based loan, and is not buying anything in such a way that it becomes their property so that they can sell it on to you. 

Is buying a car on installments from a bank haram?
But if we assume that the bank buys the car in real terms and becomes its owner, then sells it to you in installments for a higher price, there is nothing wrong with that; this is akin to the first scenario. 
The Standing Committee was asked: 
A man asked his friend to buy a car for him with cash, then sell it to him for a deferred payment with extra money as a profit. Is this regarded as riba? 
They replied:  
“If a man asks another to buy a specific car for him or a car that meets certain requirements that he stipulates, and promises to buy it from him, and he buys it from the one whom he asked to do that and takes possession of it, it is permissible for the one who asked for it to buy it from him after that for cash or in installments with a specific amount of extra money as a profit. 
This is not a kind of selling what one does not have, because the one who you asked for this product is selling it to the one who asked for it after buying it and taking possession of it. He does not have the right to sell it to his friend, for example, before he buys it, or after he buys it and before he takes possession of it, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade selling goods until the merchant has them in his own possession.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 13/152)

20092,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20092,What is the ruling on seeking Islamic knowledge?,What is the ruling on seeking Islamic knowledge?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Seeking Islamic knowledge is fard kifaayah: if enough people undertake this duty, it becomes Sunnah for the rest of them. Seeking knowledge may become obligatory on each individual, i.e. fard ‘ayn, in the case of knowledge of an act of worship he wants to do or interaction he wants to engage in. In this case he has to know how to worship Allah by this act of worship, or how to engage in this interaction. But knowledge other than this is fard kifaayah, so the seeker of knowledge should have the intention of undertaking something which is fard kifaayah, so that he may attain the reward for one who is doing something obligatory whilst he is seeking knowledge.
 Undoubtedly seeking knowledge is one of the best of deeds; indeed it is a kind of jihaad for the sake of Allah, especially in these modern times when bid’ahs have begun to appear in Muslim societies and are becoming widespread, and ignorance is common among those who issue fatwas without knowledge, and people have started to argue a great deal. These three issues all make it essential that young people be keen to seek knowledge.
 1 – Bid’ahs whose evil is apparent
2 – People who issue fatwas without knowledge
3 – Extensive arguing about issues which may be clear to the scholars but there are people who argue about them without knowledge.
 For this reason we need scholars who have deep and extensive knowledge, who have an understanding of Islam, who are wise in advising the slaves of Allah, because many people nowadays have theoretical knowledge, but they do not focus on finding the best means of reforming and educating people. They do not realize that if they issue a fatwa saying such and such, it becomes lead to greater evil, the extent of which no one knows except Allah.","From Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, Kitaab al-‘Ilm, p. 23"

For details on their beliefs, please see the answer to Question no. 4569. 
With regard to praying behind one who is of this nature, Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
“It is not permissible to pray behind any of the mushrikeen, including those who seek the help of anyone other than Allaah and seek support from him, because seeking help through anyone other then Allaah, such as the dead, idols, the jinn, etc. is shirk, the association of others with Allaah, glorified be He.” 
Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (vol. 2, p. 396)
And he said: one should not pray behind any imaam who is known to exaggerate concerning the Ahl al-Bayt (members of the Prophet’s household). If no such thing is known about him or any other Muslim, then it is OK to pray behind them.

Can we ask you for some advice from you to the students in this university?",,,"Praise be to Allah. My 
          advice to the young people is as follows:
  Make 
          use of the break to seek Islamic knowledge which is lacking in this 
          university; uphold the ties of kinship which you have missed out on 
          because you have been far away from your families; be active in calling 
          your neighbours, relatives and kinsfolk to Islam, as you have missed 
          out on that by being far away in the university residence.
  Keep 
          in touch with good people – “And keep yourself 
          (O Muhammad) patiently with those who call on their Lord (i.e. your 
          companions who remember their Lord with glorification, praising in prayers, 
          and other righteous deeds) morning and afternoon” [al-Kahf 18:28 – interpretation 
          of the meaning]. Do not lose touch with them 
          during the break. It may be useful to take part in programs even if 
          that is with other good people in the area to which you will go if you 
          do not have any of the good people from the university to be with.  
 Beware 
          of haraam things such as traveling to places of immorality or the lands 
          of kufr, or watching haraam channels.
