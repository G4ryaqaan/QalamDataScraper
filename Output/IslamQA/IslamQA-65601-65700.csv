65605,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65605,It is difficult for him to pray qiyaam because of his work situation and because he is a heavy sleeper,"My work situation means that I work all night and I sleep in the day. It is difficult for me to get up and offer the four other prayers, because I get so tired at work. I cannot get up whilst I am sleeping and do the prayers and then go back to sleep. And there is another reason, which is that I am a heavy sleeper, and when I sleep no one can wake me up, even if I intend to get up and pray during the day.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Some of the 
    Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) used to do difficult work such as 
    farming, herding livestock, gathering firewood and so on, but they did not 
    neglect their prayers, rather they used to observe the prayers regularly, 
    not just on time but also in congregation. They were regular in praying and 
    seeking knowledge, and they were not granted any concession allowing them 
    not to pray because of work. 
Hence it is 
    obligatory for those who work and others to offer the prayers on time. 
    Allaah praises the believers who do not let their work distract them from 
    obeying Allaah, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Men whom 
    neither trade nor sale (business) diverts from the remembrance of Allaah 
    (with heart and tongue) nor from performing As‑Salaat (Iqaamat‑as‑Salaat) 
    nor from giving the Zakaah. They fear a Day when hearts and eyes will be 
    overturned (out of the horror of the torment of the Day of Resurrection).
38. That 
    Allaah may reward them according to the best of their deeds, and add even 
    more for them out of His Grace. And Allaah provides without measure to whom 
    He wills”
[al-Noor 
    24:37-38]
Secondly: 
The one who 
    sleeps is excused at the time when he is sleeping, but when he wakes up it 
    becomes obligatory for him to perform the prayer after he has woken up. 
It was 
    narrated that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The 
    Prophet of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Whoever forgets a prayer or sleeps and misses it, the expiation for that is 
    to pray it when he remembers it.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (572) and Muslim 
    (684). 
This hadeeth 
    indicates that the one who sleeps is not accountable during the time of his 
    sleep, and there is consensus on this point. 
The apparent 
    meaning of the hadeeth is that there is no negligence in sleep if a person 
    sleeps before the time for prayer begins or after that but before the time 
    becomes too short. And it was said that if a person deliberately goes to 
    sleep before the time becomes too short and he takes that as a means of not 
    praying because he thinks it most likely that he will not wake up until the 
    time for the prayer is over, then he is sinning. But the apparent meaning is 
    that there is no sin on him because of sleeping, because he did that at a 
    time when it was permissible to do it, so he is included in this hadeeth. 
    But if he did it deliberately in order to miss the prayer, then there is no 
    doubt that he is sinning thereby. End quote. 
Nayl 
    al-Awtaar 2/33, 34. 
Thirdly: 
What a 
    person should do before going to sleep is to be keen to wake up at the time 
    of prayer, and to take the means that will help him to perform the prayer on 
    time. If he does that but does not wake up, then he is excused because he 
    did what he had to, and “Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope” 
    [al-Baqarah 2:286]. That happened to the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) on some of his journeys. 
It was 
    narrated that Abu Qataadah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “We 
    travelled with the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) by night and some of the people said: “Why don’t you let us 
    stop at the end of the night so that we may rest, O Messenger of Allaah?” He 
    said: “I am afraid that you will sleep and miss the prayer.” Bilaal said: I 
    will wake you up.” So they lay down and Bilaal leaned his back against his 
    mount, but his eyes grew heavy and he slept. Then the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) woke up when the sun had risen. And he 
    said: “O Bilaal, what about what you said?” He said: “I have never slept 
    like that before.” He said: “Allaah took your souls when He willed and 
    returned them to you when He willed. O Bilaal, get up and call the people to 
    prayer.” And he did wudoo’ when the sun had risen high and turned white, 
    then he stood and prayed. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (570) and Muslim (681).  
The Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) took the means of waking up 
    by appointing Bilaal to alert them when it was time to pray, but sleep 
    overtook him, and he and the people slept until the sun had risen. They were 
    not negligent, hence the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said, “There is no neglect among the people.” 
As for one 
    who stays up all night because of work etc and does not take the means and 
    prays after the time for the prayer is over, he is regarded as deliberately 
    not praying, and he is not excused because of his sleep. 
Shaykh 
    Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked 
    about someone who stays up all night and is not able to pray Fajr until 
    after the time for it is over – will it be accepted from him? And what is 
    the ruling on the rest of the prayers which he offers on time? 
He replied: 
With regard 
    to Fajr prayer which he delays until the time for it is over when he is able 
    to offer it on time, because he could sleep early, this prayer of his will 
    not be accepted from him, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever does an action that is not in accordance 
    with this matter of ours will have it rejected.” Narrated by Muslim. The one 
    who deliberately delays a prayer until the time for it is over, with no 
    excuse, will have it rejected, because he has done something that is not in 
    accordance with the command of Allaah and His Messenger, so it will be 
    rejected. 
But he may 
    say: I was asleep, and the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “Whoever sleeps and misses a prayer or forgets it, let him 
    pray it when he remembers it, for there is no expiation for it but that.” 
We say: If 
    he could have slept early so that he would wake up early, or he could have 
    set an alarm clock to wake him up, or he could have asked someone to wake 
    him up, then his delaying the prayer and not getting up for it is regarded 
    as deliberately delaying the prayer, so it will not be accepted from him.

Fourthly: 
A man may be 
    a heavy sleeper, and one of two scenarios must apply: 
1 – He 
    sleeps deeply because he has stayed up at night to work, seek knowledge or 
    pray qiyaam. In this case it is not permissible for him to miss performing 
    prayers on time because of that, and he should look for another job that 
    will not cause him to miss the prayers. Similarly it is not permissible for 
    him to let naafil deeds – even seeking knowledge, which is basically 
    obligatory – distract him and cause him to miss the prayers. In this case 
    his not praying is regarded as deliberate, because he could change his job 
    and he could avoid staying up at night. 
Shaykh 
    Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
What our 
    brothers who go on trips should do is thank Allaah for this blessing, as He 
    has made them prosperous and given them a life of comfort and ease, in an 
    atmosphere of safety and freedom from fear, and they should do what Allaah 
    has enjoined on them of praying on time, whether that is Fajr prayer or any 
    other. It is not permissible for them to delay Fajr prayer on the basis that 
    they are sleeping, because in most cases there is no excuse for this sleep, 
    because they can use alarm clocks to wake them up to pray on time, and they 
    can sleep early so that they can wake up refreshed. End quote.

    Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (12/question no.

2 – A person 
    may be a naturally heavy sleeper, and it has nothing to do with work or 
    staying up at night. This is known in the case of some individuals. If that 
    is the case, then he is excused if he takes the means but does not wake up. 
It was 
    narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: A 
    woman came to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    when we were with him and said: “O Messenger of Allaah, my husband Safwaan 
    ibn al-Mu’attal does not pray Fajr until the sun has risen.” Safwaan was 
    with him, so he asked him about what she had said, and he said: “O Messenger 
    of Allaah, we are a family who are known not to wake up until the sun has 
    risen.” He said: “When you wake up, then pray.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 
    2459; classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 
    7/65 
Conclusion: 
    in your case it seems that your sleeping heavily has to do with staying up 
    at night, and you are staying up at night because of work. On this basis, it 
    is not permissible for you to stay in that job, because it is causing you to 
    forsake the most important pillar of Islam after the Shahaadatayn. So look 
    for another job, and Allaah will compensate you with something better than 
    it. You will see a change for the better in your religious commitment, your 
    body and your mental attitude. As for your religious commitment, performing 
    the prayers on time is one of the most important duties, and not doing it is 
    one of the worst of haraam actions. As for your body, the doctors have 
    described many harmful effects suffered by those who work at night; sleeping 
    during the day does not give the body the same rest as sleeping at night 
    does. And all of that has a negative effect on one's mental attitude.

65617,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65617,Is it essential to wash plates after they have been used and washed by non-Muslims?,I am living in a non muslim country where we have to share the kitchen with Non Muslims. After using the plates the non muslims colleaugues wash them but when we want to use these plates can we use them as such or do we have to wash them 3 times so as get their TAHARA ?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The basic principle concerning plates is that they are pure, whether they are used by a Muslim, one of the People of the Book (a Jew or a Christian) or anyone else, unless it is certain that they are naajis (impure). Hence the majority of fuqaha’ are of the view that it is permissible to use the vessels of the kaafirs. They quote a number of things as evidence for that, including the following:  
1 – Allaah has permitted us to eat the food of the people of the Book, i.e., meat slaughtered by them. It is known that it will sometimes come to us cooked in their vessels, which indicates that it is permissible to use their vessels. 
2 – The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was invited to eat some barley bread and other food by a Jewish boy.  Narrated by Ahmad, classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 1/71. 
3 – The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions did wudoo’ from the leather water skin of a mushrik woman. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 337; Muslim, 682.  
This evidence indicates that it is permissible to use the vessels of the kuffaar. 
But if we know that they cook pork or dead meat in their vessels, or they drink wine from them, then it is better to avoid using them unless it is necessary and we can find no alternative. Then we may wash them and eat from them. If they wash them, then we do not have to wash them again, and it is not necessary to wash them three times, rather they should be washed until there are no traces of their food and drink left on them. 
The evidence for that is the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (5478) and Muslim (3567) from Abu Tha’labah al-Khushani who said: I said, “O Prophet of Allaah, I live in a land where there are some of the People of the Book; can we eat from their vessels?” He said: “As for what you said about the People of the Book, if you can find anything else, do not eat from their vessels, but if you cannot find anything else then wash them and eat from them.” 
***** 
This may be understood as referring to those among them who use their vessels for haraam things, because of the report from Abu Dawood (3839): “We live next to some of the People of the Book who cook pork in their vessels and drink wine in their vessels.” The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If you can find anything else, eat from them and drink from them, but if you cannot find anything else, then wash them with water and eat and drink.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
Al-Khattaabi said: 
The basic principle in this matter is that if it is known that the mushrikeen cook pork in their pots and drink wine from their vessels, then it is not permissible to use them until after they have been washed and cleaned.” 
End quote from ‘Awn al-Ma’bood. 
The phrase “If you can find anything else, eat from them and drink from them” means eat and drink from those other vessels. This command means that it is mustahabb, according to the majority of fuqaha’, i.e., it is mustahabb to avoid these vessels, and it is makrooh to use them even if they are washed, unless there are no others available in which case it is no longer makrooh. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim (13/80): 
The reason why it is better not to eat from them even after washing is because they are regularly used for naajis things.” End quote. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 1/68: 
The hadeeth of Abu Tha’labah al-Khushani according to which the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do not eat from them unless you cannot find anything else, in which case wash them and eat from them” indicates that it is better not to use them, but many of the scholars interpreted this hadeeth as referring to people who are known to handle naajis things, such as eating pork and so on. They said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade eating from their vessels unless we cannot find anything else, in which case we should wash them and eat from them. This is a good interpretation, and is implied by the basic principles of sharee’ah. End quote. 
To sum up: 
If these people do not use those vessels for drinking wine or eating pork or dead meat, then it is permissible to use them. If they do use them for haraam or naajis kinds of food and drink, then it is better not to use them if you can find something else. If you cannot find something else then you can use them after they have been washed, whether it is you or they who wash them.

65620,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65620,He is outwardly Muslim but he rarely attends the mosque; should we think badly of him?,"There is a man who claims to be a Muslim. He is from a European country and lives in a Muslim country. He rarely attends the mosque to pray, and when I say to him, “I do not see you observing the prayers on time,” he says that he prays at home. It should be noted that his residency visa and passport still show him as a Christian, but he says that he has a certificate which proves that he is a Muslim. What are our duties towards this man?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Those who claim to be Muslim should publicly practise the 
    rituals of Islam and adhere to its laws as much as they can. If a Muslim 
    claims that he is doing acts of worship such as prayer and giving zakaah, he 
    should be believed and what he says should be accepted. 

    All we know is what people show outwardly, and our Lord has 
    not commanded us to look into people’s hearts, because no one can do that. 

    The basic principle is that everyone who utters the 
    Shahaadatayn should be regarded as a Muslim, so long as he does not do 
    anything that nullifies his Islam. 

    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) said: When the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    died and Abu Bakr was appointed as caliph, and some of the Arabs reverted to 
    kufr, ‘Umar said: “O Abu Bakr, how can you fight the people when the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    ‘I have been commanded to fight the people until they say Laa ilaaha 
    ill-Allaah (There is no god but Allaah), and whoever says Laa ilaaha 
    ill-Allaah, his wealth and his life are protected from me except in cases 
    dictated by Islamic law, and his reckoning will be with Allaah’?” Abu Bakr 
    said: “By Allaah, I will most certainly fight those who separate prayer and 
    zakaah, for zakaah is what is due on wealth. By Allaah, if they withhold 
    from me a young goat that they used to give to the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), I will fight them for 
    withholding it.” ‘Umar said: “By Allaah, when I saw that Allaah had opened 
    Abu Bakr’s heart to the idea of fighting, I knew that he was right.” 

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6924; Muslim, 20. 

    Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    Al-Khattaabi said: This hadeeth indicates that whoever 
    appears outwardly to be a Muslim, the outward rulings of Islam apply to him, 
    even if he is inwardly a kaafir. 
The difference of 
    opinion has to do with one whose corrupt beliefs are discovered and he shows 
    that he has recanted; can that be accepted from him or not? As for the one 
    whose position is unknown, there is no dispute that the outward rulings 
    apply to him. End quote. 

    Fath al-Baari, 12/279, 280 

    Since you do not know whether this man holds any corrupt 
    beliefs and he has not done anything that nullifies Islam, no one has the 
    right to accuse him of not being a Muslim. The basic principle is that he is 
    as he appears to be. 

    Read the following hadeeth and ponder the discussion that 
    took place between the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) and Khaalid ibn al-Waleed (may Allaah be pleased with him): 

    It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: A man with sunken eyes, high cheekbones, a prominent 
    forehead, a thick beard, a shaven head and a waist-wrapper that was tucked 
    up, stood up and said: “O Messenger of Allaah, fear Allaah!” The Messenger 
    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Woe to 
    you! Am I not the most entitled of all the people of earth to fear Allaah?” 
    Then the man turned away. Khaalid ibn al-Waleed said: “O Messenger of 
    Allaah, shall I strike his neck (cut off his head)?” He said, “No, for 
    perhaps he prays.” Khaalid said: “How many are there who pray and say with 
    their tongues what is not in their hearts?” The Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I have not been ordered 
    to search people’s hearts.” 

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4351; Muslim, 1064 

    It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Utbah said: I heard 
    ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) say: “People used to 
    be judged by the wahy (revelation) at the time of the Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but now the wahy has 
    ceased. Now we will judge you according to what we see of your outward 
    deeds. Whoever appears good to us, we will trust him and draw close to him, 
    and what is in his heart has nothing to do with us. Allaah will call him to 
    account for what is in his heart. And whoever appears bad to us, we will not 
    trust him and we will not believe him, even if he says that inwardly he is 
    good.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2641. 

    Undoubtedly prayer is the best of a person’s deeds, so if you 
    have seen him praying – even if that is only rarely – then he has shown you 
    that he is Muslim, so he should be trusted and believed. You should honour 
    this man and help him to apply the teachings of Islam and teach him the 
    rulings of sharee’ah, including the importance of prayers and of offering 
    prayer in congregation in the mosque. Show him the good attitude of Islam, 
    and if he is not sincere then perhaps he will be influenced and will become 
    sincere both outwardly and inwardly.

65621,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65621,Does Allah Forgive All Sins?,"I am a Muslim woman, but the Shaytan has been controlling me for a while. I committed major sins, but now I regret it. I have turned to Allah and repented to Him, but I heard that no fasting or prayer will be of any benefit to me because I have committed the worst of major sins. Is that true? Will Allah really never accept my repentance?","The Quran and Sunnah indicate that Allah forgives all sins no matter how great or how many, for the one who repents to Him.","Repentance is a blessing from Allah


Does Allah forgive all sins?


Does Allah forgive shirk?","Praise be to Allah.Repentance is a blessing from Allah
We praise Allah for having guided you to repent, and we ask Him to make you steadfast in adhering to His religion, and to grant you a good end. You should note that you have been greatly blessed and must give thanks to Allah. How many sinners die without having repented? How many of those who are astray die before turning back to their Lord? Undoubtedly the fact that Allah has enabled you to repent is a great event in your life, and this should be a time when you start to obey Him and strive harder in worshipping Him. 
Does Allah forgive all sins?
You should realize that what you have heard about repentance , prayer and fasting not being accepted from one who has committed major sins is false, and it is speaking about Allah without knowledge. There is a great deal of evidence in the Book of Allah and the sunnah (teaching) of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to indicate that Allah accepts His slave’s repentance from all sins, no matter how great they are, and it is not permissible for anyone to try to stop a person from repenting, no matter how great and how heinous his sins. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say: O ‘Ibadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [39:53] 
Allah says, stating that He forgives the greatest of sins (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who invoke not any other ilah (god) along with Allah, nor kill such a person as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.
The torment will be doubled for him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace;
Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [25:68-70] 
Does Allah forgive shirk?
This clearly indicates that Allah forgives all sins – even shirk – and it tells us of an immense bounty, which is that bad deeds are turned to good deeds. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“No sin is too great for Allah to forgive for the one who repents, rather He forgives shirk and other sins for those who repent, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say: O ‘Ibadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [39:53] 
This verse is general in meaning because it is addressed to all those who repent.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa)
Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated from Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There was among the people who came before you a man who killed ninety-nine people. Then he asked about the most knowledgeable person on earth, and was directed to a hermit, so he went to him, told him that he had killed ninety-nine people, and asked if he could be forgiven. The hermit said, ‘No,’ so he killed him, thus completing one hundred. Then he asked about the most knowledgeable person on earth and was directed to a scholar. He told him that he had killed one hundred people, and asked whether he could be forgiven. The scholar said, ‘Yes, what could possibly come between you and repentance? Go to such-and-such a town, for in it there are people who worship Allah. Go and worship with them, and do not go back to your own town, for it is a bad place.” So the man set off, but when he was halfway there, the angel of death came to him, and the angels of mercy and the angels of wrath began to argue over him. The angels of mercy said: ‘He had repented and was seeking Allah.’ The angels of wrath said: ‘He never did any good thing.’ An angel in human form came to them, and they asked him to decide the matter. He said: ‘Measure the distance between the two lands (his home town and the town he was headed for), and whichever of the two he is closest to is the one to which he belongs.’ So they measured the distance, and found that he was closer to the town for which he had been headed, so the angels of mercy took him.” 
Al-Tirmidhi narrated that Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, said: ‘O son of Adam, so long as you call upon Me and ask of Me, I shall forgive you for what you have done, and I shall not mind. O son of Adam, were your sins to reach the clouds of the sky and were you then to ask forgiveness of Me, I would forgive you and I would not mind.’” [Sahih al-Tirmidhi] 
Ibn Majah narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who repents from sin is like one who did not sin.” [Sahih Ibn Majah]
These verses and hadiths (prophetic traditions) indicate that Allah forgives all sins, no matter how great or how many, for the one who repents to Him. 
So strive in worship and obedience, regret the negligence and sins of the past, and note that Allah has no need of His slaves yet despite that He rejoices in their repentance, and even turns their bad deeds into good deeds . 
We ask Allah to help you to remember Him, give thanks to Him and worship Him properly.

    [al-Baqarah 2:185]

    It makes no difference whether the journey is difficult or 
    easy. 

    The scholars differed concerning the definition of what makes 
    a person a traveller and thus entitled to the concessions granted to 
    travellers, one of which is that a fasting person may break his fast. 

    The majority of scholars define it in terms of distance, 
    which is approximately 80 kilometers. 

    Others – and this is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn 
    Taymiyah – are of the view that what counts is ‘urf (custom – what is 
    customarily regarded as travel), and not the distance. 

    So whatever people customarily regard as being travel is 
    travel, and comes under the rulings on travel in sharee’ah. 

    Undoubtedly travelling from Amsterdam to Paris is something 
    that people would customarily regard as travel, even if one comes back the 
    same day. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ 
    (4/257) concerning a man who travelled a long distance in a short period: “A 
    short period for a long distance, such as one who travels from al-Qaseem to 
    Jeddah and back in one day – this is called travel, because people prepare 
    themselves for it and they think that they are travelling.” End quote. 

    The distance between al-Qaseem and Jeddah is approximately 
    900 kilometers.  

    Based on this, if a person travels from Amsterdam to Paris 
    and comes back the same day, he is travelling according to both scholarly 
    opinions, whether we base it on the distance or on what is customarily 
    regarded as travel. 

    Is it better for him to fast or not to fast? 

    The answer is: 

    It is better for him to fast unless he finds it difficult, in 
    which case it is better for him not to fast. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    It is better for the traveller to fast, unless he finds it 
    too difficult, in which case he may break his fast. The evidence that it is 
    better for him to fast is as follows: 

    1 – This is what the Messenger  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) did. Abu’l-Darda’ (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: 
    We were with the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on 
    a hot day, such that one of us would lay his hand on his head because it was 
    so hot, and there was no one among us who was fasting except the Messenger 
    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and ‘Abd-Allaah 
    ibn Rawaahah. Narrated by Muslim. 

    2 – If he fasts it will be easier for him, because making up 
    the fast may be more difficult – in most cases – than doing it at the proper 
    time. That is because if he fasts in Ramadaan he is fasting at the same time 
    as other people, and that will be easier for him. When Allaah enjoined 
    fasting on His slaves, He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“ Allaah intends for you ease, 
    and He does not want to make things difficult for you”

    [al-Baqarah 2:185]

    3 – If he fasts Ramadaan whilst travelling, he will discharge 
    his duty more quickly, because no one knows what will happen to him after 
    Ramadaan, so fasting will discharge his duty more quickly. 

    There is a fourth benefit, which is that if he fasts in 
    Ramadaan he will have fasted at the best time, which is Ramadaan. 

    But if it is too difficult he should not fast when he is 
    travelling, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) saw a crowd around a man who was shaded from the sun. He said: “What is 
    this?” They said: “One who is fasting.” He said: “It is not righteousness to 
    fast when travelling.” He said that to one who fasted whilst travelling 
    although it was difficult for him. One day when the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) made a stop during a journey, those who 
    were fasting fell down because they were exhausted, whilst those who were 
    not fasting put up the tents and gave water to the travellers and animals. 
    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Today 
    the reward has gone only to those who are not fasting.” Narrated by Muslim.

Will my fast be invalidated by that?","Being given medicine via injection does not break the fast, whether it is intramuscular or intravenous, so long as the injected substance does not provide nutrition.",,"Praise be to Allah.Being given medicine via injection does not break the fast , whether it is intramuscular or intravenous, so long as the injected substance does not provide nutrition, because in that case it is like food and drink which are forbidden to the one who is fasting. 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah (10/252): 
“It is permissible to be given medicine via injection into the muscles or veins when fasting during the day in Ramadan. But it is not permissible for the fasting person to be given nutrients during the day in Ramadan, because that comes under the same rulings as consuming food and drink, and this injection is regarded as a means of breaking the fast in Ramadan. If it is possible to give the injection into a muscle or vein during the night, that is preferable.”
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the spread of anaesthesia through the body – does that break the fast? And what about the flow of blood when a tooth is extracted? 
He replied: 
“Neither of these breaks the fast, but the blood that flows after removal of a tooth should not be swallowed.” (Fatawa Ramadan, p. 525) 
It makes no difference whether it is a local or general anaesthetic . Many of the jurists have stated that if a person who is unconscious is awake for even a moment of the day, his fast is valid, so long as he formed the intention to fast from the night before.” 
Imam al-Shafi`i said in al-Umm (8/153): 
“If a man loses consciousness for a day or two days during the month of Ramadan, and he did not eat or drink anything, then he has to make up for those days. But if he was awake for part of the day, then he is regarded as having fasted on that day.”
Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni (4/343): 
“If he was unconscious for the whole day and did not wake up at all, then his fast is not valid, according to the view of our imam (i.e., Imam Ahmad) and al-Shafi`i… 
If the person who was unconscious woke up for a part of the day, his fast is valid, whether that was at the beginning or the end of the day.”

Allah has prescribed fasting and made it easy, hence Allah says in the verses on fasting (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you.” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
Allah has permitted those who are sick not to fast in Ramadan. 
Can sick people skip fasting?
The sick person for whom that is permissible is the person who has a real illness for whom there is the fear that it may be made worse or that his recovery may be delayed, or a sickness that is expected to occur because of fasting. We have explained that in the answer to question no. 12488 . 
Based on this, if fasting causes the questioner to vomit or become dizzy because of physical weakness, there is nothing wrong with her not fasting in Ramadan, but she has to make up the fasts, if she is able to. If she is not able to, then she must feed one poor person for each day. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
What is the ruling on one who breaks the obligatory fast because of thirst? 
He replied: 
""The ruling is that it is haram for one who is observing an obligatory fast – whether in Ramadan or making up a missed fast, or observing an expiatory fast, or fidyah – to break this fast. But if his thirst is so intense that he fears that he may be harmed or may die, then it is permissible for him to break the fast and there is no sin on him, even if that is in Ramadan, if it is so bad that he fears he may be harmed or may die.

While he was fasting during the day in Ramadaan, he reached puberty. Does he have to make up that day? What about a kaafir who becomes Muslim, or a menstruating woman who becomes pure, or an insane person who regains his sanity, or a traveller who comes back home and was not fasting, or a sick person who recovers and was not fasting? What do these people have to do with regard to refraining from eating and drinking for the rest of that day and making up the fasts?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The people mentioned in the question do not all come under the same ruling. We have mentioned the difference of opinion among the scholars and some of their words in the answer to question no. 49008. 
We can divide the people mentioned in the question into two categories: 
The boy who reaches puberty, the kaafir who becomes Muslim and the insane person who regains his sanity come under the same ruling, which is that they must refrain from eating and drinking for the rest of the day, but they do not have to make up the fast. 
As for a menstruating woman who becomes pure, the traveller who settles and the sick person who recovers, they come under one ruling, which is that they do not have to refrain from eating and drinking, and they do not benefit at all from doing so, but they have to make up the fast. 
The difference between the first and second groups is that the first group attains the conditions of being obliged to fast, namely being an adult, being a Muslim and being sane. Once it is proven that they are obliged to fast, then they must refrain from eating and drinking, but they do not have to make up the fast because they refrained when it became obligatory for them to refrain, and before that they were not obliged to fast. 
As for the second group, the command to fast is addressed to them so it was obligatory in their case, but they had excuses which made it permissible for them not to fast, namely menses, travel and sickness, so Allaah granted them a concession and allowed them not to fast. The sanctity of the day was waived in their case, but when their excuses ceased to exist during the day, they would not benefit from refraining from eating and drinking, but they have to make up that day after Ramadaan ends. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
If a traveller reaches home and he is not fasting, then he is not obliged to refrain from eating and drinking, and he may eat and drink for the rest of the day, because refraining will not benefit him in any way, as he is required to make up this day. This is the correct view and it is the view of Maalik and al-Shaafa’i, and it is one of the two views narrated from Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him). But he should not eat and drink openly.

If a woman who is menstruating or bleeding following childbirth becomes pure during the day, she does not have to refrain from eating and drinking, and she may eat and drink, because refraining will not benefit her in any way, as she is obliged to make up that day. This is the view of Maalik and al-Shaafa’i, and it is one of the two views narrated from Imam Ahmad. It was narrated from Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he said: “The one who ate at the beginning of the day, let him eat at the end of it” i.e., if it was permissible for him to eat at the beginning of the day, it is permissible for him to eat at the end of it too.

If a person does not fast during the day in Ramadaan for a legitimate excuse, is it permissible for him to eat and drink for the rest of the day? 
He replied: 
It is permissible for him to eat and drink, because he broke the fast for a legitimate excuse, and if he broke the fast for a legitimate excuse, then the sanctity of the day does not apply in his case, and he is allowed to eat and drink, unlike a man who breaks the fast during the day in Ramadaan with no excuse; in his case we say that he is obliged to refrain from eating and drinking, even though he is obliged to make it up. Attention must be paid to the difference between these two cases. End quote. 
Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 19/question no. 60. 
He also said: 
During our discussion on fasting, we stated that if a woman is menstruating then she becomes pure during the day, the scholars differed as to whether she is obliged to refrain from eating and drinking, or whether it is permissible for her to eat and drink for the rest of the day. We say that two views have been narrated concerning that from Imam Ahmad, one of which – which is the well-known view of the madhhab – is that she must refrain from eating and drinking. The other view is that she does not have to refrain, and it is permissible for her to eat and drink. We say that the second view is the view of Maalik and al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on them), and this is what is narrated from Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him), because he said, “The one who ate at the beginning of the day, let him eat at the end of it”. And we say that what the seeker of knowledge must do with regard to matters concerning which there is a difference of opinion is to look at the evidence, and to adopt the view which he believes to be most correct and not to pay attention to any other opinion so long as he has evidence, because we are enjoined to follow the Messengers, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And (remember) the Day (Allaah) will call to them, and say: ‘What answer gave you to the Messengers?’”
[al-Qasas 28:65]
With regard to quoting as evidence the saheeh hadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) issued the command to fast ‘Ashoora’ during the day, and the people refrained from eating and drinking for the rest of the day, we say: they have no evidence in this hadeeth, because fasting the day of ‘Ashoora’ is not like a case when the reason for not fasting ceases to exist. Rather it is confirming the obligation of fasting. There is a difference between the cessation of a reason not to do something and confirmation that something is obligatory, because what confirming that something is obligatory means is that the ruling that it is obligatory was not there before, whereas the cessation of a reason not to do something means that the ruling is established but there is a reason not to follow it. 
A similar case would be if a kaafir became Muslim during the day. If a person becomes Muslim the obligation is confirmed for him. And a similar case is if a boy reaches puberty during the day when he is not fasting; the obligation is confirmed for him. So we say to the one who became Muslim during the day: you have to refrain from eating and drinking, but you do not have to make up this day. And we say to the boy who reached puberty during the day: you have to refrain from eating and drinking, but you do not have to make up this day. This is unlike a menstruating woman who becomes pure; in that case the scholars are unanimously agreed that she has to make up that day. If a menstruating women becomes pure during the day, the scholars are unanimously agreed that if she refrains from eating and drinking for the rest of the day, that will not benefit her and it will not count as fasting, and she has to make up that day. Hence we can see the difference between confirmation of the obligation and the cessation of a reason not to do something. If a menstruating woman becomes pure, this comes under the heading of the cessation of a reason not to do something, and if a boy reaches puberty or, as the questioner mentioned, the fasting the day of ‘Ashoora’ was enjoined before fasting Ramadaan was enjoined, this comes under the heading of confirmation of obligation. And Allaah is the Source of strength. End quote.

65641,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65641,‘Umrah on Behalf of Someone Else Who is Alive?,Is it permissible to do ‘Umrah on behalf of living people who are able to do it?,"It is not permissible to do Hajj or ‘Umrah on behalf of any living person who is able to do that, but in the case of one who is not able, if it is the obligatory Hajj then it is permissible, but if it is nafl then it is the subject of a difference of scholarly opinion.",,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to do Hajj or ‘Umrah on behalf of anyone who is able to do them himself. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“With regard to appointing others to do Hajj or ‘Umrah on their behalf, this is something that, unfortunately, people at present have taken to extremes, that may be invalid according to Islam. 
That is because there are two reports from Imam Ahmad as to whether it is permissible to appoint someone else to perform a nafl duty on one's behalf. 
One report says that it is not permissible for a person to appoint someone else to do a nafl duty such as Hajj or ‘Umrah on his behalf, whether he is sick or healthy. This report seems to be more correct, because acts of worship should be done by a person himself, so that he may attain whatever worship and humility before Allah he can attain. 
You can see the difference between a man who does Hajj for himself and a man who gives money to someone else to perform Hajj on his behalf. The latter does not gain the benefits of worship such as reforming his heart and humbling himself before Allah.
It is more like a financial transaction whereby he appoints someone else to buy and sell on his behalf. 
If he is sick and wants to delegate someone to do a nafl deed on his behalf, we say that this is not something that is taught in the Sunnah. Rather the Sunnah is to appoint someone to do things on one's behalf with regard to fard (obligatory) actions only. The difference between fard and nafl is that the fard deed is binding upon a person, and if he cannot do it then he may appoint someone to do Hajj and ‘Umrah on his behalf. But nafl deeds are not obligatory, so it is said: So long as you are sick and you have done the obligatory action, then give praise to Allah for that, and spend the money that you wanted to give to someone to do Hajj or ‘Umrah on your behalf in other ways; use it to help a poor man who has not done the obligatory Hajj yet. That is better for you than saying, “Take this and do Hajj on my behalf,” even if you are sick.
As for the obligatory Hajj, people are not negligent about it, praise be to Allah. You can hardly find anyone who appoints someone else to do the obligatory Hajj on his behalf unless he is unable to do it. 
This is something that is mentioned in the Sunnah, as in the hadith of Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which a woman came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, the command of Allah to His slaves to perform Hajj has come when my father is an old man who cannot sit firmly in the saddle. Can I perform Hajj on his behalf?” He said: “Yes.” 
Conclusion: There are two reports from Imam Ahmad about appointing someone else to perform a nafl duty on one's behalf. One of them says that it is not valid, and the other says that it is valid whether one is able or not. 
But in my view it is undoubtedly more correct to say that it is not valid to appoint someone to do a nafl deed on one's behalf, whether one is able to do it or not. With regard to obligatory Hajj, the Sunnah says that the one who is unable to do it and has no hope that the situation will change may send someone on his behalf.” (Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 21/140) 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah (11/68): 
“The Muslim who is able to perform Hajj should hasten to do it and in this case it is not permissible for him to appoint someone else to do Hajj on his behalf, and the Hajj of someone else will not suffice for him so long as he is able to perform Hajj himself.”
“The scholars of the Standing Committee favoured the view that one may perform Hajj and ‘Umrah on behalf of a living person who is unable to do them, even if it is nafl.” 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 11/81 
“If you have done ‘Umrah on your own behalf, it is permissible for you to do ‘Umrah on behalf of your mother and father if they are unable to do it because of old age or sickness for which there is no hope of recovery.”
This was also the view favoured by Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him), who was asked: I want to perform Hajj on behalf of my mother. Is it essential to ask her permission, knowing that she has already performed the obligatory Hajj? 
He replied: 
“If your mother is unable to perform Hajj because of old age or sickness from which there is no hope of recovery, there is nothing wrong with your performing Hajj on her behalf, even if that is without her permission. It is proven that a man asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for permission saying: O Messenger of Allah, my father is an old man who cannot do Hajj or ‘Umrah. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do Hajj and ‘Umrah on behalf of your father.” 
And a woman asked him for permission, saying: “O Messenger of Allah, my father is an old man and he cannot perform Hajj or travel. Shall I perform Hajj on his behalf?” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do Hajj on behalf of your father.” Hajj may also be performed on behalf of the deceased, because of the sahih hadiths that have been narrated to that effect, and because of these two hadiths.” (Fatawa Ibn Baz, 16/414)
To conclude, it is not permissible to do Hajj or ‘Umrah on behalf of any living person who is able to do that, but in the case of one who is not able, if it is the obligatory Hajj then it is permissible, but if it is nafl then it is the subject of a difference of scholarly opinion.

Abu Haneefah, al-Shaafa’i and Ahmad were of the view that he should do wudu for each prayer after the time for it begins. 
Maalik was of the view that it is permissible for the one who is suffering from incontinence to do wudu once and offer all his prayers with it, so long as his wudu is not broken by something other than that ongoing incontinence. 
The first view is more on the safe side and is the view of the majority. 
See the answer to question no. 22843 for more information. 
But if the person who suffers from incontinence breaks his wudu in a manner other than his ongoing problem, then he must repeat wudu, and it is not permissible for him to offer any prayer, obligatory or naafil, without doing wudu. Al-Bukhaari (6954) and Muslim (225) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah does not accept the prayer of any one of you if he breaks his wudu until he does wudu.” 
The scholars are unanimously agreed that purification from minor impurity is a condition of prayer being valid, and it is not valid without it. See al-Majmoo’ by al-Nawawi (3/139); Majmoo’ al-Fatawa by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (22/99). 
As for what your intention should be in this situation: 
You should intend to purify yourself in order to perform the prayer.

Does this also include the sins one may have knowingly committed against the rights of other Muslim brothers and sisters which he or she now deeply regrets doing but cannot admit his or her guilt to the victims as this may create even more problems?",,,"Praise be to Allah.There are many things which expiate for sins, including repentance, seeking forgiveness, doing acts of worship, carrying out hadd (Islamically prescribed) punishments on those who have done acts for which such punishments are due, and so on. But righteous deeds such as prayers, fasting, Hajj, etc. only expiate for minor sins, according to the majority of scholars, and they only expiate for transgressions against the rights of Allah. With regard to sins that have to do with the rights of other people, they can only be expiated by repenting from them. One of the conditions of repenting from them is restoring the rights of those who have been wronged. 
Muslim narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The martyr will be forgiven for all his sins except debt.” 
Al-Nawawi said in Sharh Muslim: 
The words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) “except debt” draw attention to all rights owed to other people. Jihad (fighting for Allah’s cause), martyrdom and other righteous deeds do not expiate for transgressions against the rights of other people, rather they only expiate for transgressions against the rights of Allah. End quote. 
Ibn Muflih said in al-Furoo’.
Martyrdom expiates for everything except debt. Our Shaykh (i.e., Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, may Allah have mercy on him) said: and except sins against other people such as murder and oppression. End quote. 
It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah: Repentance in the sense of regretting what one has done and resolving not to do it again is not sufficient to waive the rights that are owed to other people. Whoever has stolen another person’s wealth, or seized it by force, or has wronged him in any other way, will not have finished with the matter by simply regretting it, giving up the sin and resolving not to do it again. Rather he has to restore those rights. This is a principle on which the fuqaha (jurists) are unanimously agreed. End quote. 
This has to do with material possessions, such as wealth that has been taken by force or by deceit. With regard to intangible rights such as in cases of slander and backbiting, if the person who has been wronged knows about it, then it is essential to apologize to him and ask for his forgiveness. If he does not know, then he should not be told; rather the one who wronged him should pray for him and pray for forgiveness for him, because telling him may upset him and create enmity and hatred between the two. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: According to the saheeh hadith (authentic narration): “Whoever has wronged his brother with regard to his blood, his wealth or his honour, let him come and set matters straight before there comes a Day on which there will be no dirhams and no dinars, only good deeds and bad deeds, and if he has good deeds (they will be taken and given to the one whom he wronged), otherwise some of the bad deeds of the one whom he wronged will be taken and added to his burden, then he will be thrown into the Fire.” This has to do with cases where the one who was wronged was aware of it; but if he was gossiped about or slandered and he does not know, then it was said that one of the conditions of repentance is telling him, or it was said that this is not essential, which is the view of the majority; both views were narrated from Ahmad, but his view on such matters is that one should do good deeds for the one who was wronged, such as praying for him, praying for forgiveness for him and doing good deeds to be given to him, to take the place of that backbiting and slander. Al-Hasan al-Basri said: The expiation for gossip is to pray for forgiveness for the person about whom you gossiped. End quote. 
Majmoo’ al-Fatawa. 
The scholars of the Standing Committee said, concerning a man who stole money from a slave: 
If he knows the slave or he knows someone who knows him, he can tell him to look for him and give him the money in silver or the equivalent, or whatever he agrees upon with him. If he does not know who he is and he thinks that he will never find him, he should give it or the equivalent in cash to a charity on behalf of its owner. If he finds him after that, he should tell him what he did; if he accepts that, all well and good, but if he objects and demands his money, then he should give it to him, and the money he gave in charity becomes an act of charity on his own behalf. He also has to ask Allah for forgiveness and repent to Him, and pray for the other person.

65670,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65670,Can a woman whose fast is broken because of menstruation in Ramadaan eat?,When a woman has her monthly period it is well known that she cannot fast. Is it permissible for her to eat during the day in Ramadaan? Are there any guidelines?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.When women who are menstruating or bleeding following childbirth become pure during the day in Ramadaan (i.e., the bleeding stops), and when a traveller arrives at his destination, and when a sick person who stopped fasting recovers, they do not gain anything by refraining from eating during the day. They broke their fast for a reason, and making them refrain from eating is a matter which requires a shar’i text as proof. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked:  
If a woman who is menstruating or bleeding following childbirth becomes pure during the day in Ramadaan (i.e., the bleeding stops), does she have to refrain from eating and drinking? 
He replied: 
If a woman who is menstruating or bleeding following childbirth becomes pure during the day in Ramadaan, she does not have to refrain from eating and drinking, and she may eat and drink, because refraining from doing so will not benefit her in any way, as she has to make up that day anyway. This is the view of Maalik and al-Shaafa’i, and is one of the two views narrated from Imam Ahmad. It was narrated that Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “Whoever eats at the beginning of the day, let him eat at the end,” i.e., if it was permissible for him not to fast at the beginning of the day, it is permissible for him not to fast at the end of it. End quote. 
Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 19/question no. 59 
As for the guidelines on that: 
Some of the scholars said that those who are permitted not to fast in Ramadaan, such as the sick, travellers and menstruating women, should not show that they are not fasting, lest they be accused of lacking in religious commitment by those who do not know that they are excused.  
Others are of the view that if the reason for the excuse is obvious, there is nothing wrong with them showing that they are not fasting, but if the reason is invisible, then they should break their fast in secret. The second view is more correct. 
Al-Mardaawi said in al-Insaaf (7/348): 
Al-Qaadi said: The one who eats openly in Ramadaan is to be denounced, even if there is an excuse. It says in al-Furoo’: It seems that it is not allowed in any case. It was said to Ibn ‘Aqeel: Should travellers, the sick and menstruating women be prevented from breaking their fast openly lest they be accused? He said: If the reason is invisible, they should not be allowed to break the fast openly, such as one who is sick with no outward signs of sickness and a traveller on whom there is no sign of travelling.” End quote.

    Firstly: 

    We congratulate you for the blessing of Islam, and we ask 
    Allaah to make you steadfast and to help you and strengthen your faith. And 
    we ask Him to guide all your family and your siblings, so that you will be a 
    means of their success. 

    Secondly: 

    If you are afraid to declare your Islam and fear that some 
    harm may be befall you, or if you want to delay telling people until you 
    have learned more about Islam and are able to call your family to Islam, 
    there is nothing wrong with you doing that. There is also nothing wrong with 
    your stopping the prayer if you are afraid that someone will see you. 

    The basic principle is that when the Muslim has started an 
    obligatory prayer, he is obliged to complete it, and it is haraam for him to 
    stop it, unless he has an excuse. 

    The fuqaha’ have listed some excuses which make it 
    permissible to stop the prayer. These include: 

    -Fear of being harmed by an 
    enemy or a wild animal.

    -Fear for one's wealth or 
    property, such as if a person is praying and someone comes who wants to take 
    his property, or he fears that his mount will run away.

    -Stopping the prayer in order to 
    save someone from a fire or from drowning, or fear that a blind man may fall 
    into a well.

    See Radd al-Muhtaar, 1/654; al-Mabsoot, 3/2; 
    Kashshaaf al-Qinaa’, 1/380. 
If you fear harm to 
    yourself if any of your family see you praying and find out that you are a 
    Muslim, there is no sin on you if you stop praying at that time, then pray 
    after the danger has passed, which is what you did.

     Thirdly: 

    You should strive to learn the rulings of Islam and keep 
    company with good believing women, who will help you to obey Allaah. Think 
    about the best way to call your family to Islam and strive to do that, for 
    they are the most entitled of all people to your good treatment and da’wah. 

    May Allaah help us and you to do that which He loves and 
    which pleases Him.

65683,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65683,"She drinks wine in front of him and he is afraid that if he divorces her, she will take the children, and she is a kaafir",I'm married to a christain women & I have two kids from her In Ramadan while I'm eating breaking my fast she drink wine with the food & I can't say no cause if I keep pushing her for that she might get a divorce & take the kids then it will be hard to make them Muslims. Is it haram for me in ramadan to set with her while she's drinking & her family too & I don't drink.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Although marriage to a kitaabi woman – a Jewish or Christian 
    woman – is permissible, there is a great deal of risk involved in that, the 
    most serious of which is the danger to the religious commitment of the 
    children and offspring, because she may try to corrupt their religious 
    commitment, especially if she lives in a non-Muslim country. 

    How can you convince your children that drinking alcohol is 
    haraam, when they see their mother drinking it? 

    Many scholars are of the view that if a Muslim man marries a 
    kitaabi woman, he may stop her drinking wine and eating pork. This is the 
    view of the majority of Shaafa’i and Hanbali fuqaha’ and it is the view of a 
    number of Hanafis. 

    It says in al-Bahr al-Raa’iq (3/111), quoting from 
    some of the Hanafis: The Muslim may forbid his dhimmi wife from drinking 
    wine, as he may prevent his Muslim wife from eating garlic and onions if he 
    dislikes that. This is the truth as is obvious. End quote. 

    It says in Mughni al-Muhtaaj (4/314): The kitaabi 
    woman who is married is like a Muslim woman with regard to spending, 
    division of time (in the case of plural marriage) and divorce. She should be 
    made to do ghusl after menses, nifaas and janaabah, and she should not eat 
    pork according to the more correct (scholarly) opinion. Both she and a 
    Muslim wife should be forced to wash off any impurity that gets onto their 
    bodies. End quote. 

    It says in al-Insaaf – a Hanbali book – (8/352): The 
    dhimmi wife should be prevented from drinking any intoxicant to the point of 
    intoxication, but he does not have the right to forbid her to drink amounts 
    that do not intoxicate, according to the correct view. This was stated by 
    Imam Ahmad. And it was narrated from him that she should not be allowed to 
    drink it at all. It says in al-Targheeb: the same applies to her 
    eating pork. End quote. 

    The Maalikis are of the view that he does not have the right 
    to stop her drinking wine or eating pork, as it says in al-Taaj 
    wa’l-Ikleel (5/134). 

    If you are not able to stop her, because of what you said 
    about the fact that she may ask for a divorce and take the children, then 
    you must explain to your wife that it is part of kindness and good treatment 
    among spouses not to drink wine openly in front of you. If she insists, then 
    you should keep away from their gatherings, as a sign of denouncing evil, as 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And it has already been revealed to you in the Book (this 
    Qur’aan) that when you hear the Verses of Allaah being denied and mocked at, 
    then sit not with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if 
    you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them. Surely, 
    Allaah will collect the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:140]

    This general principle applies to everyone who is unable to 
    take action against an evil; he must leave the place where the evil is being 
    committed if he is able to, otherwise he will be a partner in the sin. 

    You have to be patient and do everything you can to call your 
    wife to Islam; make her love Islam by your attitude and actions. We advise 
    you to make du’aa’ for it is the greatest of weapons. May Allaah guide her 
    and her family at your hands.

65685,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65685,Is it permissible to make a player-place in which women will be in front of the imam?,"What is the ruling on making a place for women to pray (Taraweeh) in front of the mosque (i.e., the prayer-place will be in front of the imam and they will be separated by the wall of the mosque)? There is no other place for the women to pray.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    It is better for a woman to pray in her house. It was 
    narrated from Umm Humayd,  the wife of Abu Humayd al-Saa’idi, that she came 
    to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: “O 
    Messenger of Allaah, I love to pray with you.” He said: “I know that you 
    love to pray with me, but your praying in your room is better for you than 
    your praying in your house, and your praying in your house is better for you 
    than your praying in your courtyard, and your praying in your courtyard is 
    better for you than your praying in the mosque of your people, and your 
    praying in the mosque of your people is better for you than your praying in 
    my mosque.” So she gave orders that a ‘mosque’ be built for her in the 
    innermost and darkest part of her house, and she used to pray there until 
    she met Allaah (i.e., died).  

    Narrated by Ahmad, 26550; classed as saheeh by Ibn Khuzaymah, 
    1689; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 340. 

    ‘Abd al-‘Azeem Abaadi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    The reason here is that women's praying at home is better so 
    as to avoid fitnah, and that was more strongly emphasized after the 
    tabarruj (wanton display) that women introduced. 

    ‘Awn al-Ma’bood, 1/193. 
However, if a woman 
    wants to go to the mosque to pray, it is not permissible for anyone to stop 
    her, if she adheres to the conditions stipulated for her to go out, because 
    the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do not 
    stop your womenfolk from going to the mosques if they ask you for 
    permission.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 865; Muslim, 442. 

    See also question no. 9232. 

    Secondly: 

    The basic principle concerning prayer in congregation is that 
    the members of the congregation should be behind the imam. The scholars 
    differed concerning the ruling on one who prays in front of the imam. The 
    most correct of the views is that it is permissible when there is an 
    excuse. 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    was asked: 

    Does prayer count if one prays in front of the imam or behind 
    him in the mosque with a barrier between them, or not? 

    He replied: 

    If a person prays in front of the imam, there are three 
    scholarly views: 

    1 – The prayer is valid in all cases, even though it may be 
    makrooh. This is the well-known view of the madhhab of Maalik, and is the 
    former view of al-Shaafa’i. 

    2 – It is not valid in all cases, as is the view of Abu 
    Haneefah, and of al-Shaafa’i and Ahmad according to the well-known views of 
    their madhhabs. 

    3 – It is valid if there is an excuse, but not otherwise, 
    such as if there is crowding and a person cannot offer Friday prayer or the 
    funeral prayer except by standing in front of the imam. In that case, 
    praying in front of the imam is better than not praying at all. 

    This is the view of a number of scholars, and it is an 
    opinion in the madhhab of Ahmad and others. It is the fairest view and is 
    the most likely to be correct, because the most that can be said about not 
    standing in front of the imam is that it is one of the obligatory duties of 
    praying in congregation, and all the obligatory duties may be waived when 
    there is an excuse, even if they are essential parts of the prayer. So it is 
    more appropriate to say that the obligatory duties that are specific to 
    prayer in congregation prayer may be waived. Hence things that the 
    worshipper is unable to do are waived in his case, such as standing, 
    reciting, clothing himself, purity (tahaarah) and so on. 

    In the case of prayer in congregation, he may sit in the 
    odd-numbered rak’ahs for the purpose of following the imam (i.e., he may sit 
    after the first and third rak’ahs – this applies to one who joins the prayer 
    late, after one rak’ah). If he does that deliberately when he is praying 
    alone, his prayer is invalid. If he catches up with the imam when he is 
    prostrating or sitting, then he should say takbeer and prostrate with him or 
    sit with him, in order to follow him, even though that will not count for 
    him. And he should do the prostration of forgetfulness with the imam, even 
    though he is not the one who forgot. 

    Also, during the fear prayer, he does not have to face 
    towards the qiblah, and he does many actions, and he leaves the imam before 
    the salaam, and he makes up the first rak’ah before the imam says the 
    salaam, and he does other things that are done in order to be part of the 
    congregation. But if he does them with no excuse, then his prayer is 
    invalid.  

    The point here is that one prays in congregation according to 
    what one is able to do. If the member of the congregation cannot follow the 
    imam except by standing in front of him, the most that can be said is that 
    he has not stood where he should in order to be part of the congregation, 
    and this is less serious than other options. 
The same applies to 
    praying behind a row standing alone. If a person cannot find someone to join 
    him, and he did not pull someone out of the row to stand with him, then he 
    should pray standing alone behind the row; he should not leave the 
    congregation. Similarly, if a woman cannot find another woman to stand with 
    her, then she should stand on her own behind the row. This is according to 
    the consensus of the imams, because standing with another person in a row is 
    enjoined when it is possible, not when it is not possible. 

    Al-Fataawa al-Kubra, 2/331-333 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was 
    asked: Is it permissible for a member of the congregation to stand in front 
    of the imam? 

    He replied: 

    The correct view is that it is obligatory for the imam to 
    stand in front, and it is not permissible for a member of the congregation 
    to stand in front of the imam, because the imaam is supposed to be an 
    example and his place is in front of the members of the congregation, so it 
    is not permissible for a person to pray in front of the imam. The Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray in front of 
    the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them), and based on that, the 
    prayer of those who pray in front of the imam does not count, and they have 
    to repeat their prayer. But some scholars made an exception in cases of 
    necessity, such as if the mosque is small and there is not enough room for 
    everyone; in that case they may pray to the right and the left of the imam, 
    and in front of him and behind him, because of necessity.  End quote. 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 
    13/44 
Based on this, you should try hard to make the place for women behind the imam; if there is no place and you cannot bring the imam forward, then there is no sin in it, in sha Allaah.

Is that riba?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This partnership is known to the scholars as a mudaarabah partnership (limited or silent partnership), which is where one person gives his money to another to do business with it, and the profit is shared between them according to whatever agreement they make. The one who does the business is called mudaarib. 
See al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 8/116 
In order for this to be permissible, it is essential that the division of profits be according to a set share of the profit, such as one-half, one-third, and so on. 
It is not permissible for that share to be a fixed share of the capital, such as if he took some money to do business with it and they agreed that he would give him – for example – ten percent of the capital on the basis that this is profit. 
Similarly it is not permissible for the profit to be a set amount of money – such as one thousand dirhams every year or every month. Rather it must be a share of the profit, according to whatever they have agreed upon. 
If a specific amount of money or a specific percentage of the capital is stipulated, then the partnership contract is haraam and invalid. 
All of this has been agreed upon by the scholars, and there is no dispute among them concerning that, praise be to Allah. 
Ibn al-Mundhir said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that an agent may stipulate to the owner of the money that he will get one-third of the profit, or half, or whatever they agree upon, provided it is a known percentage (of the profit). End quote from al-Mughni. 7/136 
Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni (7/146): 
If the share of one of the partners is set as a specific amount of money, or a sum of money is set along with his share – such as if he stipulates that he will have a percentage plus ten dirhams, the partnership becomes invalid. Ibn al-Mundhir said: All of the scholars from whom I learned are agreed that the mudaarabah partnership is invalidated if one or both of them stipulate that they will have a certain amount of money. Among those from whom we learned that are Maalik, al-Awzaa’i, al-Shaafa’i, Abu Thawr and Ashaab al-ra’y… That is not valid for two reasons. The first is that if a specific amount of money is stipulated, it is possible that they may not make any other profit, so that person will take all of the profit. And it is possible that they may not make a profit at all, so it would be taken from the capital. Or they may make a great deal of profit, and the one for whom a specific amount of money was stipulated will lose out. The second reason is that the share of the agent should be a known percentage, because it is not permissible for it to be a set amount of money. If the percentages are unknown, it is invalid. End quote. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
If it stipulates in the mudaarabah contract that the owner of the money will get a certain amount of money, this is not permissible, according to scholarly consensus. That is because transactions should be based on fairness, and these transactions are a kind of partnership, and it can only be a partnership if each partner gets a percentage, such as one-third or one-half. If one of them is given a specific amount, that is not fair, rather it is unjust. End quote from Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 38/83 
The Standing Committee was asked about two men, one of whom gave the other a sum of money with which to do business for him, and they agreed that he would give him 3% of the capital as a profit each month.

Your giving the money to the trader to do business with it and his giving you a set amount, three percent of the money, is not permissible, because it is a kind of guaranteed profit. End quote from Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 14/318 
They were also asked about a company that takes money from people to do business with it, and gives them a share of 30 percent of the capital every year, and claims that it makes a profit of 100 percent. 
They replied: 
If the company mentioned gives the partners a set, guaranteed amount of profit, this transaction is not permissible, because it is riba.

However, it was narrated from a number of the Companions that there is nothing wrong with praying Witr after the Adhan of Fajr until the Iqamah is given.","When does the time for Witr end?


Can you pray Witr after fajr?","Praise be to Allah.When does the time for Witr end?
The time for praying Witr ends when dawn comes , because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: `The night prayers are two by two, then when you fear that dawn is about to break, then pray one (Rak`ah) and make the prayers that you have offered odd-numbered.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhaari, 472) 
Muslim (754) narrated from Abu Sa`id (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Pray Witr before dawn comes.”
Can you pray Witr after fajr?
“If the Adhan for Fajr is given and a person has not yet prayed Witr, he should delay it until the forenoon, after the sun has risen high, then he should pray whatever he can, two or four Rak`ahs or more, two by two. If his habit is to pray three and he did not pray them at night, he should pray them in the forenoon with four Rak`ahs and two Taslims. If his habit is to pray five and he was not able to do them at night because he was sick or he was asleep and so on, he should pray them in the forenoon with six Rak`ahs and three Taslims, and so on, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do that. He used to pray Witr with eleven Rak`ahs, but if sickness or sleep kept him from doing that, he would pray them during the day with twelve Rak`ahs. This is what `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said according to the report narrated from her by Al-Bukhari and Muslim, and this is what is prescribed for the Ummah, following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz, 11/300) 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was also asked: Should the last of Witr prayer be done when the Adhan begins for Fajr or at the end of the Adhan? If a person sleeps and misses it, should he make it up and how? 
He replied: 
“It is prescribed for every believer, male and female, to pray Witr every night . The time for it is between `Isha’ prayer until dawn begins. It is narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim from Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The night prayers are two by two, then if one of you fears that dawn is about to break, let him pray one Rak`ah to make what he has prayed odd-numbered.” Muslim narrated that Abu Sa’id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Pray Witr before dawn comes.” 
Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi narrated, in a report that was classed as authentic by Al-Hakim, from Kharijah ibn Hudhafah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has blessed you with a prayer that is better for you than red camels.” We said: O Messenger of Allah, what is it? He said: “Witr, between `Isha’ prayer and the break of dawn.” And there are many Hadiths on this topic, which indicates that Witr ends with the break of dawn. 
If a worshipper does not know when dawn is, he may rely on a Mu’dhdhin who is known to pay attention to the right time [when giving the Adhan]. If the Mu’dhdhin who pays attention to the right time gives the Adhan, then he has missed Witr. 
As for the one who gives the Adhan before dawn breaks, he has not missed Witr when he gives the Adhan and this does not mean that it has become prohibited for one who is fasting to eat and drink, and the time for Fajr prayer has not begun with this Adhan. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Bilal gives the Adhan at night, so eat and drink until Ibn Umm Maktum gives the Adhan.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). Ibn Umm Maktum (may Allah be pleased with him) was a blind man who did not give the Adhan until he was told that dawn had come. From what we have mentioned it is clear that the time for Witr ends with the first Adhan if the Mu’dhdhin pays attention to the correct time of dawn, but if the Mu’dhdhin gives the Adhan when the Muslim is in the final Rak'ah of Witr, he should complete it because he cannot be certain that dawn has come just from hearing the Adhan, and there is nothing wrong with that in sha Allah. 
If a person misses Witr, it is prescribed for him to pray what he usually prays during the day, but he should make it even-numbered by adding one Rak`ah. If he usually prays three, he should make it four, and if he usually prays five, he should make it six, and so on, saying the Taslim after each two Rak`ahs. 
It is narrated by Muslim that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: If the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) missed Witr at night because he was sick or sleeping, he would pray twelve Rak`ahs during the day. And he usually prayed eleven Rak`ahs, but if sickness or sleep kept him from doing that, he would pray twelve Rak`ahs as `Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said, saying the Taslim after each two Rak`ahs, as `Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray ten Rak`ahs at night, saying the Taslim after each two Rak`ahs, and praying Witr with one.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The prayers of the night and day are two by two.” Narrated by Imam Ahmad and the authors of As-Sunan with an authentic Isnad (chain of narration) from the Hadith of Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). It is narrated in the books of Al-Bukhari and Muslim with the wording, “The night prayers are two by two,” as we stated at the beginning. And Allah is the Source of strength.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz, 11/305-308)

He replied: 
“If dawn breaks and you have not prayed Witr, then do not pray Witr, rather pray four Rak`ahs during the day if you usually pray Witr with three, and six if you usually pray Witr with five, and so on. 
Because if the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) missed the night prayers, he would pray twelve Rak`ahs during the day.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, 14/114) 
It was narrated from a number of the Companions that there is nothing wrong with praying Witr after the Adhan of Fajr until the Iqamah is given – such as Ibn Mas`ud (as was narrated by An-Nasa’i, 1667; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih An-Nasa’i), Ibn `Abbas (as narrated by Malik in Al-Muwatta’, 255) and `Ubadah ibn As-Samit (as narrated by Malik in Al-Muwatta’, 257) 
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a person who sleeps and misses Witr prayer. 
He replied: 
“He may pray between dawn and Fajr prayer, as `Abdullah ibn `Umar, `Aaishah and others did. Abu Dawud narrated in his Sunan that Abu Sa’id (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever sleeps and misses Witr or forgets it, let him pray it when morning comes or he remembers.” There are different reports from Ahmad as to whether he should make up the even-numbered Rak`ahs too. The correct view is that he should make up even-numbered Rak`ahs too. 
It is narrated in an authentic report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever sleeps and misses a prayer or forgets it, let him offer it when he remembers it, for that is the time for it.” This includes obligatory prayers, Qiyam Al-layl , Witr and regular Sunnah prayers .” (Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra, 2/240) 
If the Muslim does either of these two things, there is no sin on him in sha Allah.

Thus it is like eye drops, and eye drops do not invalidate the fast, according to the correct scholarly opinion. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“There is nothing wrong with a fasting person using kohl , or putting drops in his eyes , or putting drops in his ears ; even if he notices the taste of that in his throat, that does not invalidate his fast, because it is not food or drink, and is not like food or drink. The evidence forbids eating and drinking, and that does not include things that are not like food or drink. What we have mentioned is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) and it is the correct view.” (Fiqh al-'Ibadat, p. 191)

65694,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65694,He vowed to break the fast in Ramadaan,What is the ruling if a man vows to break the fast during the day in Ramadaan?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: fasting Ramadaan is obligatory for adult, sane Muslims who are able to fast. If a person meets those criteria, it is haraam for him to break the fast with no excuse. It is also haraam for him to swear to do that, because by swearing such an oath he is resolving to do something haraam. 
Secondly: 
If a Muslim swears to commit a sin, it is not permissible for him to do what he swore to do, rather he must break his vow and offer expiation for breaking an oath (kafaarat yameen), because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever vows to do something then sees that something else is better than it, let him do what is better and offer expiation for his vow.” Narrated by Muslim, 1650. 
Kafaarat yameen (expiation for breaking an oath) means feeding ten poor persons, or clothing them, or freeing a slave. If a person cannot do any of these things, then he must fast for three days, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allaah will not punish you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He will punish you for your deliberate oaths; for its expiation (a deliberate oath) feed ten Masaakeen (poor persons), on a scale of the average of that with which you feed your own families, or clothe them or manumit a slave. But whosoever cannot afford (that), then he should fast for three days. That is the expiation for the oaths when you have sworn. And protect your oaths (i.e. do not swear much). Thus Allaah makes clear to you His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) that you may be grateful”
[al-Maa’idah 5:89]
See also question no. 45676
Thirdly: 
The one who has done that must repent to Allaah, for it is very repugnant for a Muslim to swear to break the fast in Ramadaan. This indicates that he is careless about the sacred limits set by Allaah, and that he takes them lightly. In the answer to question no. 38747 we stated that it is very dangerous to break the fast in Ramadaan with no excuse, and that the one who does that is regarded as a hypocrite, Allaah forbid. 
Al-Dhahabi said in al-Kabaa’ir (p. 64): 
Among the believers it is well established that the one who fails to fast in Ramadaan although he is not sick and he has no excuse that would permit that, is worse than an adulterer or one who is addicted to alcohol; indeed they would have doubts about his Islam and would think that he is a heretic and a deviant.

65698,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65698,Can You Say `I Love You’ while Fasting?,"My fiancé is Muslim. I have researched and learned the meaning and purpose of Ramadan. Please advise me on what is permitted, and not permitted regarding affection (holding hands, saying I love you, etc.) during this time of fasting.","•	It is permissible for a fasting person to exchange affectionate and loving words with his wife and it is permissible for him to do some affectionate actions such as kissing his wife or hugging her or holding her hand, if he can control his desire.
•	As for a fiancée, before the marriage contract is done, the fiancé does not have the right to speak words of affection to his fiancée, or to hold her hand, because he is still a stranger (non-Mahram) to her and is like any other non-Mahram man.",,"Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for a fasting person to exchange affectionate and loving words with his wife (with whom he has done the marriage contract), and it is permissible for him to do some affectionate actions such as kissing his wife or hugging her or holding her hand, if he can control his desire. That is because `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to kiss (his wife) when he was fasting, and touch (his wife) when he was fasting, but he was the most able of you to control his desire.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1792 and Muslim, 1854)
Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:  
“A man may kiss his wife, joke with her and touch her without having intercourse when he is fasting. All of that is permissible and there is no sin in it, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to kiss (his wife) when he was fasting, and touch (his wife) when he was fasting. But if one fears that he may do that which Allah has forbidden because he is quickly aroused, it is disliked for him to do that. If he ejaculates , he has to refrain from eating and drinking for the rest of the day and make up for that day, but no expiation is required of him according to the majority of scholars. As for Madhiy (prostatic fluid) , that does not invalidate the fast according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, because the basic principle is that the fast remains valid and is not invalidated, and because it is difficult to guard against it. And Allah is the Source of strength.” (Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 4/202) 
This applies only to a man and his wife. As for a fiancée, before the marriage contract is done, the fiancé does not have the right to speak words of affection to his fiancée , or to hold her hand, because he is still a “stranger” (non-Mahram) to her and is like any other non-Mahram man.  No one should take this matter lightly, and it makes no difference if the fiancée is a Muslim or a Christian. 
We are happy to read your question about fasting among the Muslims, because it indicates that you have a love for knowledge and are keen to learn the rulings of this religion. We congratulate you for that and encourage you to learn more. We ask Allah to guide you to that which Allah loves and is pleased with, and we ask Him to create harmony between you and your fiancée, and to help you to marry him.
