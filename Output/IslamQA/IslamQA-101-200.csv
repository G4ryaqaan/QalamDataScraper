101,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/101,"Paying zakat on total wealth not just the amount greater than 
nisaab","Should the Zakat be paid from the WHOLE money you 
have (if more than elnisab) or from the amount you have 
beyond elnisab (the remains from subtracting the nisab 
from the whole money) ?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillah (all praise be to Allah). 
  Al-Khiraqi (rahimahullah) said: ""If it (nisaab al-zakaat) is reached then 
  a quarter of 1/10 is due upon it and upon whatever exceeds it, no matter how 
  small."" Ibn Qadama (rahimahullah) in explaining this statement said: ""Meaning 
  that if the amount of silver has reached 200 (which is the nisaab of silver 
  in dirhams as has been discussed in question # 
  64) and 
  the dinars 20 (which is the nisaab for gold in the units of mathaqeel [ 
  see also question #64]) 
  then one is obligated to pay zakaat upon it one quarter of 10 percent, as this 
  has been established by his (the Prophet's  , peace 
  be upon him) saying 'for silver, one fourth of one tenth' "" (Al-Mughni 
  ma'a al-sharh il-kabeer, 2/600)
As for the meaning of the rest of the statement 
  that what exceeds the nisaab no matter how small, it means that 1/4 of 1/10 
  (i.e. 2.5%) is also due upon this surplus difference. Thus, the overall meaning 
  is that if monetary wealth surpasses the amount of nisaab, then zakaat is due 
  upon it all, and not upon the surplus only, nor upon the amount of nisaab only, 
  but on the total. Note that zakaat must be paid on the excess amount over nisaab, 
  regardless of how small. This is the opinion taken by Malik and al-Shaafi'i

103,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/103,Permissibility of eating meat slaughtered by Christians and Jews,"I have read several articles on what foods are halal and what foods are haraam. But when I 
go to a restaurant I still [doubt] if what I am eating is halal. I know that the meat needs to be 
slaughtered in the name of Allah, and it shall be done by the people of the book. Currently 
in the United States, the Christians and the Jews don't follow the true Bible and the Torah. 
The Christians call Isa (may Allah be pleased with him) the son of God. Is the meat cut by 
these people halal, can it be eaten?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillah (praise be to Allah).al-hamdu lillah (all praise be to Allah). The Christians and the Jews of 
the People of the Book in our times are indeed those People of the Book that are mentioned in the texts 
of shari'ah in the Qur'an and sunnah, and they are the kuffar (unbelievers) of the Jews and Christians that 
existed at the time of the Prophet  (peace be upon him). They are the people of the corrupted Torah 
and corrputed Injeel, as evidenced by the fact that Allah (swt) addressed them and named them ""People 
of the Book"" despite their being kuffar and their books being corrupted, as indicated in the following 
interpretations of the meanings of the aayaat:
Aala 'imran: 70:
O People of the Book! why do you reject the Signs of Allah, of which you are (yourselves) witnesses?
Al-maa'ida: 15:
O People of the Book! there has come to you Our Messenger, revealing to you much that you used to 
hide in the Book, and passing over much (that is now unnecessary): There has come to you from 
Allah a (new) light and a perspicuous Book.
Al-hashr: 2: (in regards to the Battle of Bani al-Nadeer):
It is He Who got out the Unbelievers among the People of the Book from their homes at the first 
gathering (of the forces)
These kuffar among the People of the Book have certain abrogating qualities distinguishing them from 
the rest of the kuffar, by virtue of the fact that they are recipients of heavenly guidance and are people of 
previously revealed divine bookseven though they corrupted themunlike the remainder of the kuffar 
who have neither a previous book nor messenger, such as the Hindus, the Sikhs, the Buddhists, the 
communists, and others.
Because of this distinguishing quality, the shari'ah has specified special rulings particular to the People of 
the Book, and exceptions specific to them in some rulings, such as allowing marriage to the the chaste 
and virtuous (whether virgins or previously married) among their women and the permissibility of eating 
their slaughtered meat, as indicated in the following ayah (interpretation of the meaning):
Maa'ida: 5
This day are (all) things Good and pure made lawful unto you. The food of the People of the Book is 
lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them. (Lawful unto you in marriage) are (not only) chaste 
women who are believers, but chaste women among the People of the Book, revealed before your 
time, when you give them their due dowers, and desire chastity, not lewdness, nor secret intrigues
The preceding discussion is in regards to the general ruling with respect to slaughtered meat of the 
People of the Book; as for the specifics, the slaughtered meat of People of the Book can be one of 
several cases:
That he slaughters it via the known way specified by shari'ah and he speaks the name of Allah upon 
it. In this case there is no problem in the permissibility of eating it.

That he does not slaughter it by the way specified by shari'ah as is the case if he chokes it or 
electrocutes it until it dies or drowns it in water until it dies or kills it by a bullet, etc. In this case 
there is no doubt that eating it is forbidden since it is maita (meat of an animal that has died without 
properly being slaughtered) and Allah has forbidden it in the Qur'an (interpretation of the meaning): 
"" and forbidden unto you is maita"" (al-Maa'ida:3)

That he mentions the name of someone or something other than Allah upon it as he is slaughtering, 
such as the Messiah or otherwise. Likewise there is no doubt that the meat in this case is haraam, 
since it is among what has been dedicated to other than Allah, which is specifically forbidden in the 
ayah in surat al-Maa'ida: 3 (interpretation of the meaning): ""Forbidden to you (for food) are: maita, 
blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which has ben invoked the name of other than Allah; that 
which has been killed by strangling or by a violent blow""

That we receive their meat and we don't know if it has been slaughtered properly or not. In this 
case the rule of thumb is that if we don't know the way of slaughter, the default is that it is 
permitted if it has been slaughtered by Muslims or Ahl il-Kitaab (Fatawa Islamiyya, Sheikh 
Abdel-Aziz Bin Baz, 3/404), as per the generally encompassing ayah (interpretation of the meaning) 
""and the food of the people to whom have been revealed the Book is permitted for you."" 
(al-Maa'ida:5) If it becomes evident to us that they have not slaughtered it properly then it would 
not be permisible.

That we receive their meat and we don't know what they have mentioned upon it, and in this case 
likewise the preferrable and recommended opinion is the permissibility of eating it, as per the hadith 
in Sahih al-Bukhari via Aa'isha (may Allah be pleased with her) that some people said to the 
Prophet  (peace be upon him) that a people come to them with meat which they do not know 
whether they have mentioned the name of Allah upon it or not. The Prophet  replied ""Mention 
the name of Allah upon it and eat it.""",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
105,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/105,Ruling on Cousin Marriage in Islam,Is it correct that our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) discouraged marrying cousins? Should marrying cousins be the last resort?,"There is nothing wrong with marriage to cousins in Islam, as cousins are not included in the maharim.","Can you marry your cousin?


Should marrying cousins be the last resort?","Praise be to Allah.Can you marry your cousin?
There is no objection whatsoever in the Islamic religion for a man to marry any of his relatives except al-maharim (those forbidden for marriage ) whom Allah mentioned in Surat Al-Nisa, 4:23 (interpretation of the meaning):
“Prohibited to you (for marriage) are: your mothers, daughters, sisters; father's sisters, mother's sisters; brother's daughters, sister's daughters; foster-mothers (who breast-fed you), foster-sisters (who breast-fed from the same woman as you); your wives' mothers; your step-daughters under your guardianship, born of your wives with whom you have consummated marriage, no prohibition if ye have not consummated; (those who have been) wives of your sons proceeding from your loins; and two sisters in wedlock at one and the same time, except for what is past; for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”
Thus, when Allah mentioned for us the relatives to whom marriage is forbidden, we then come to know that there is no objection for the remainder of the family relations. 
Should marrying cousins be the last resort?
Furthermore, there is no condition that it be the last resort as indicated in the question. Among the most prominent evidence of this fact is that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) married his daughter Fatimah to ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with them) and he is the son of her father's uncle, as well as the marriage of the Prophet himself to Zainab bint Jahsh (may Allah be pleased with her) and she is his aunt's daughter (i.e. his cousin); and there are many other such examples.
However, a different question may be asked, namely: ""Is it better or preferable for a Muslim to marry someone he is not related to rather than a relative?""
The answer to this question varies from case to case, and perhaps it may be preferable to marry people who are non-relations, for example if one aspires to form new social ties or bonds, and regards the existence of a marriage relationship with a different family as constructive in widening the circle of social bonds.

110,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/110,Ruling on smoking,Is smoking cigarettes Haraam?,,,"Praise be to Allah.And peace and blessings be on His Prophet.
Smoking is one of the things which has caused a lot of problems and harm these days and it has spread like wild fire. Before we discuss this topic in detail, we should know that Allaah the Almighty has divided things in the world into two types, good or permissible (al-tayyibaat, al-halaal) and evil or prohibited (al-khabaa'ith, al-haraam), and there is no third type. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning) in surat al-A'raaf (7:157):
""And He makes good things halaal for them and bad things haraam.""
Considering this fact, smoking can either be permissible and good or prohibited and evil.
Thus, we present some of its characteristics and let the person asking the question see himself in which type lies smoking.

There is no disagreement among the physicians and sane people that smoking is harmful for health. It is one of the major causes of lung cancer and other diseases. It is also one of the major causes of death. Since, it is known that the Islamic law prohibits everything that is harmful for a human being. Allah said (interpretation of meaning):
	""Do not kill yourself. Allah is Merciful unto you."" (Surat al-Nisaa' 4:29)
In addition, His Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said:
""There is no harm or causing of harm (in Islaam)."" (Arabic ""laa darar wa laa diraar"")
He (peace and blessings be upon him) also said:
""A person will not be able to move on the Day of Judgment until he is asked about ... his body as to what he engaged it in.""
Smoking also goes against the saying of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him):
""Your body has a right on you.""

There is no disagreement among the physicians and sane people that smoking is harmful for the health of others who inhale the polluted breath of the smoker. Medical research has proven the harmful effects of smoking mothers on their children.
The offensive smell caused by smoking is a source of pain to the worshippers of Allah among humans and angels. The angels are offended and suffer from the same things that the human beings suffer from. Allah said (interpretation of the meaning):
	""Those who cause harm to believing men and women without any reason do a great sin."" (Surat al-Ahzaab, 33:58)

The money that is spent on cigarettes is used on buying a harmful thing and is therefore an extravagance. Allah said (interpretation of the meaning):
	""… and do not be extravagant wasters. Those who are extravagant are kinsmen of Satan."" (Surat al-Israa' 17:26-27)
Extravagance (in Islam) means spending on something haraam.
Spending money on cigarettes is a waste of resources as well. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said:
""A person will not be able to move on the Day of Judgment until he is asked about ..... what he owned as to how he spent it.""


Considering all that has been presented, it can be clearly seen that smoking is an evil among many others. It is not permissible to indulge in it, or buy and sell it, or even to offer it to others. It is incumbent on a person who is addicted to it that he must make all efforts and get whatever necessary treatment to stop it. If the unbelievers have understood the harm caused by smoking and made laws regarding it, the Muslims should be even more eager to stop it and treat those who are addicted to it.
We ask Allah the Almighty to cure everyone indulging in this evil and help him in giving it up. Allah is the Best Guide to the Right Path.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Respected questioner (may Allah protect you from every evil), 
Please accept from me a well-intentioned greeting!
I commend and appreciate your wise and mature sense of judgment in supporting your friend's decision to accept Islam. It shows admirable wisdom and a balanced sense of sagacity and understanding of this blessed event.
How to embrace Islam
Regarding the procedure for embracing the religion of Islam, it is actually an extremely simple process, without complication or prolongment. This is because it is something between a person and his Lord and there are no other parties involved. 
All that is required of a person in order to embrace Islam is that he or she pronounces the two testaments of belief in the Islamic creed, believing in their meaning, then to take a complete bath with the intention of (ritual) purification in order to start performing prayers (note to ensure complete cleanliness one should shave pubic and under-arm hair, and a man should be circumcized if he is not already--Islam places great emphasis on proper hygiene and personal cleanliness).
The meaning of the shahadah
As for the two testimonies of creed, the first is ""ash-hadu an la ilaha illa Allah"" (I testify that there is no deity other than Allah), which means that one believes and confirms that there is nothing to be worshipped other than Allah and that one is prepared to implement His divine rulings and guidelines (Shari`ah) for all aspects of life. 
The second is ""ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasool ullah"" which means the belief that Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) is the seal of the prophets (i.e. the final one), whom Allah has sent with the Islamic religion to supercede all other previous religions and that it is obligatory to comply with what he has enjoined, and to abstain and renounce all that he has prohibited and restrained.
Convert to Islam NOW before it is too late
I tend to gather from your question that there is a degree of pondering on your part or inclination towards embracing the Islamic religion, joining the example of your friend. I would invite you to carry through with it without excessive delay and reluctance , for one does not know when one's fate will come. 
So why not meet one's unavoidable fate as a believer in Allah (God) and the Hereafter, a member of the religion of Islam? It is the religion which Allah has specified that He will not accept any other religion besides it, and He will not save anyone from Hell besides its followers. Undoubtedly, this step will be the greatest thing that you will ever have experienced in your life. Surely you will not regret it at all and Allah will help you to surmount the difficulties you perhaps may face in your path after accepting Islam, such as the scorn of some relatives or family members or the alientation of some friends. However, the step in fulfilling your destiny is much more important and significant than all this.
We pray for you to be bestowed with grace, and may Allah guide you to success.
Waiting for glad tidings in the near future, may Allah guard and protect you.

Is dating haram in Islam?
I was extremely pleased to receive your questions regarding the nature of the relationship between men and women in Islam.
Regarding the issue of dating in Islam , one must first define what is meant by ""dating."" If dating is understood to mean how a man and a woman get to know each other for the purpose of marriage, then there are certain guidelines and established procedures which can be discussed. 
However, if dating is understood to refer to casual relationships between men and women for the purpose of ""fun"" or ""going out"" and such, then there is no provision for this in Islam. 
Such a situation is not considered respectful for either the man or the woman, nor is it constructive for the concept or the building of the family or society or social responsibility. Opening the door to relationships of love and infatuation and passion and pre-marital sex is categorically prohibited in Islam. It does not lead to the establishment of a family nor to proper and virtuous upbringing of children nor to stability and mutual care and tranquility and peace of mind between a man and woman.
Rather, dating leads to disorder, the disgracing of one's honor and dignity, and to a lifestyle similar to that of animals, and to that of illegitimate children who are subjected to a life of vagrancy and loss. (Please see question # 61 which addresses the issue of prohibition of pre-marital relationships).
How to approach a woman for marriage in Islam
As for the former case, regarding how a man and a woman come to know each other for the purpose of marriage , it varies from circumstance to circumstance. Normally if a man has the desire to marry and has the ability to accept the responsibility, and he does not have anyone in mind, he will ask his friends, family, and relatives if there is a lady that may be suitable for him and his expectations among their acquaintances and relatives. 
If someone is suggested, he normally asks about her extensively, about her religious observance, her personality, her knowledge, strengths, weaknesses, suitability as a wife willing to accept all the relevant responsibilities, etc. 
If preliminary information seems appealing, then normally she is told that there is someone interested in meeting her and she is likewise given relevant information about him.
At this point, assuming the man and the woman as well as both families involved agree that there is potential, then the man usually visits the woman's family, often accompanied by members of his own. They are given the opportunity to see each other and sit and talk together, to converse modestly (but not in complete solitude) regarding whatever is relevant to making an informed judgment. 
The intention for this meeting should be for them to be able to make a decision whether or not they feel they are mutually suitable. Afterwards, they each evaluate their own and their families' reactions, and pray to Allah that He guides them to what is in their best interest, and to make them accept the outcome. 
When both sides feel comfortable and feel they know everything they need to, based on all that has been mentioned such as asking about the other person, knowing their family, meeting in person, etc., they can make a final decision whether to carry on with marriage or not.

what He has said regarding the marriage of a kafir (unbeliever) to a Muslim woman and 
vice versa: (interpretation of the meaning).
They are not lawful (wives) for the unbelievers, nor are the unbelievers lawful

Muslim woman for whom he is a guardian to a kafir.
Islam must be exhalted and cannot be subjugated, so how could a Muslim woman be 
put under the care of a kafir man, when the man is normally naturally in a stronger 
position? In such a situation he could cause her to corrupt the practice of her religion or 
force her into subdual by causing her to live a life of oppression with him. He could also

It is her duty to invite him to Islam and to attempt to convince him via various approaches in the hope 
that Allah may accept her efforts and give her the great reward for his guidance through her. The 
prophet   (peace be upon him) once told Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) when he sent him to a 
people who were idol-worshippers:
""Invite them to Islam and inform them what is required of them, for (I swear) by Allah, that Allah 
guides a man through you is better than if you had humr un-na'am (a particular kind of camel 
which is the most sought-after wealth among the Arabs)"" (Al-Bukhari, Fath il-Baari 3009).
As for the course of the marriage, and what she should do if her husband accepts Islam or doesn't, 
Ibn ul-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy upon him) said: What is indicated by evidence of his   (i.e., 
the prophet's) ruling is that the marriage is mawqoof, or in abeyance (i.e. suspension); if her husband 
accepts Islam before the elapsing of her 'iddah (waiting period), then she remains his wife. If her 
'iddah elapses then she has the right to marry whom she pleases or if she likes she may wait (in the 
hope he may still accept Islam). If he then accepts Islam, she becomes his wife without need of 
renewing the marriage. (Zaad ul-Ma'aad, Vol 5 p.138).

Our Imam has been leading the efforts in gathering the donations from local sources and out of town resources.  The Imam is on a bi-weekly salary and it is not in his contract to collect donations for the masjid.  The Imam has suggested the idea of building or purchasing a masjid, and he also suggested collecting the donations.  It has been suggested to us by one of the brothers that the Imam should get a percentage of the donations he collects according to Surah 6 Tawbah #60 ""Alms are for the poor and the needy, and those employed to administer the (funds)""

Dear brothers:
As-salaamu alaikum wa-rahamat ullaahi wa-barakaatuh, I ask Allah ta'ala that this message finds you all in good health and that He brings you success in all that is good. Before answering your most recent question, the following point must be made clear: Performing the duties of a mufti, a judge, an imam, a khateeb, or a mu'adhin is considered a duty of shari'ah, associated with the Hereafter, which must be rooted in one's volunteering and seeking the reward from Allah.  It is not a worldly employment for profit or attaining income, and thus one cannot apply the principle of identifying a remuneration or compensation for specifically defined duties as one would do in the case of a worldly employment contract. If one cannot find those who are willing to volunteer to fill these duties without compensation, then it is permissible to arrange a payment for he who will execute these tasks and free himself up for them, since his duties as an imam or judge or mufti or similar functions may occupy his time such that he may not find the opportunity to gain his income through other means.  Note that this payment is appointed for him for the purpose of freeing him up for his duties vis-a-vis shari'ah, and it is NOT a ""fee for hire"", i.e. NOT a salary compensating for work done.  Thus, the correct case is that he accepts money so that he can be free to make fataawa (for a mufti), NOT that he makes fataawa so that he can make money; likewise, he accepts money so that he can be free to be an imam, NOT that he works as an imam so as to make money, etc.  Both the correct and invalid cases are a means to an end; what makes one correct and the other invalid is what comprises the means and what comprises the end. The accepting of money must be the means, i.e. an instrument, aiding a person to the end, which is to establish and conduct acts of worship and pleasing Allaah, and to free himself up for this.  Acts of worship cannot be the means to the end of achieving an income. Now we come to your question regarding giving the imam a portion of the zakaat which he is gathering for the purpose of the charitable project.  This suggestion is based on the fact that he is among those who administer the funds, a category mentioned in the aayah regarding eligible parties that may receive from the zakaat funds.  This category must be identified by its definition according to shari'ah, and it is:  those officials appointed by the khalifah of the Muslims and their Imam for collecting zakaat, keeping account of it, guarding it, and distributing it among those who deserve it.  Among the prerequisites required of those who collect zakaat are:  that they are Muslim; that they are respected and trusted and don't betray; that they are reliable, trustworthy, and impartial, not inclined to favor anyone; fair and not liable to deal unjustly; knowledgeable in the required Islamic fiqh, aware of what is to be taken and what is not; disciplined and able to perform the duties. It is permissible for to give such persons a compensation from the zakaat itself or a salary from bait ul-maal from other funds.  However, the official cannot take anything from the zakaat other than what the imam gives him, nor is he allowed to accept any gifts from those from whom he is collecting zakaat, as has been indicated by authentic ahaadeeth. If there is no khalifah of the Muslims to appoint those who will collect the zakaat or the khalifah has not sent someone to collect it (in a particular, perhaps remote, location), it becomes an obligation upon those who have wealth to pay it themselves and distribute it to those who deserve it.  Further, the venerable Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Baaz has given us a fatwah indicating that it is permissible when necessary for the president of the Islamic center, or whoever is responsible for the matters of the Muslims, in non-Muslim countries, to appoint someone to collect zakaat and to give them an appropriate portion of it as a compensation, as they would be considered as among those employed to administer it. Important observation: If the person collecting zakaat is already receiving a salary from bait ul-maal such as a judge (qaadi), mufti, imam, etc., then he does not receive anything (additional) from the zakaat because he already has an income taken from bait ul-maal.  In addition, the duties of anyone in such a position includes general work for the good of the Muslims (see Al-Mughni ma'al-Sharh al-Kabeer, Vol 7, p. 319, and al-Majmoo' lil-Nawawi, Vol 6, p.188). If what he receives does not cover his needs then he would be classified as being among the poor (al-fuqaraa'), and thus would be entitled to be given enough to meet his needs.  Note, again, that he should not take anything himself unilaterally, so as not to compromise his impartiality and sincerity.

been together for 5 years and planned to be wed soon. The problem is she is the eldest 
in her family and by tradition has to look after her parents who are non-muslim.I have 
tried to convert them to the islamic faith but they refused to submit to islam.As a muslim, 
i respect their decision but will i be doing a sin if they continued to livewith my girlfriend 
and I after we wed.I deeply love and respect them even though they rejected our religion 
as they are my girlfriend's parents. They however were understanding enough to not 
keep idols and dieties in the house after we wed but they love to eat pork (just like any 
other chinese) What am i supposed to do? My girlfriend doesn't eat pork anymore and 
she has submitted to islam willingly but she is concerned about changing her name as her 
parents want her to keep her original name(ie Wong Wan Pei). Can this be allowed?",,,"Praise be to Allah.All praise is due to Allah.
First of all, we praise Allah the most glorified that He guided 
  this woman to Islam and that you are now allowed to marry her under Islamic 
  law (shari'ah). May Allah the Almighty help you to remain firm toward your faith. 
  Out of compassion and caring for your sake, please allow me to reproach a particular 
  aspect of your question, which is that you did not indicate any regret on your 
  part regarding the sinful and forbidden relationship of taking a girlfriend 
  and continuing with her in a friendship that angers and displeases Allah regardless 
  of the extent of that friendship.
Your question focused on a secondary issue regarding the ruling 
  on changing one's name which is not as serious as what you have practiced for 
  the past five years. Allah the most glorified has forbidden such an indecent 
  relationship in the Qur'an (interpretation of the meaning, ) 
""not committing fornication, nor taking them as 
  lovers (i.e. girlfriends)"" (Al-Maa'ida, 5:5) 
So, it is obligatory upon you to repent to Allah and to regret 
  what has passed and to have the firm will not to return to the same action again, 
  and to do good deeds and perform acts of worship to expiate the evils of that 
  sin, and Allah is surely forgiving and merciful. (Please see also similar discussion 
  of this issue in question #61) 
As for your statement: ""I deeply love my girlfriend's parents 
  even though they rejected our religion,"" by Allah it is extremely astonishing 
  how a Muslim man that believes in Allah and the last day can love people who 
  are non-believers that don't believe in Allah and the last day and don't forbid 
  what Allah forbids and don't practice the religion of truth and also refuse 
  the religion of Islam??! Is this not a clear violation of Allah's statement 
  in the Qur'an in surat al-Mujadlilah 58:22 (interpretation of the meaning): 
  
""You will not find any people who believe in Allah and 
  the Last Day, making friendship with and loving those who oppose Allah and His 
  Messenger (Muhammad- 
  Peace and Blessings of Allah be Upon Him), even if they are their fathers or 
  their sons or their kindred"" 
We are not saying to you curse them or pick up arms against them; 
  however, it is obligatory upon you to abhor them for their disbelief and their 
  denial of the Lord of the worlds and to hate the invalid and untruthful religion 
  that they are practicing. On the other hand, there is no objection for you to 
  treat them with kindnesswhile disliking them in your heartand to 
  be amicable towards them so that perhaps Allah will guide them through you. 
  You will find no conflict or contradiction between these two ideas if you consider 
  them carefully.
Furthermore, there is no objection to her parents living with 
  you after marriage if they do not perform forbidden acts in the home (e.g., 
  eating pork, drinking alcohol, etc.)
As for the question raised at the end of your letter regarding 
  changing her name, the answer is: if the name of the person has a forbidden 
  meaning, like the name of an idol or one of their deities or a name that means 
  worshipping other than Allah, such as Abdul-Maseeh (worship per of Jesus the messiah) or Abdul-Hussain (worshipper of Hussain) 
  then it is mandatory to change it. However, if its meaning is permissable and 
  not objectionable, e.g. if it means one of the colors such as red or green or 
  a vocation like carpenter or baker, then it is OK and it is not obligatory to 
  change it. However, if changing the name in official documents would cause the 
  person much distress or harm, then it suffices to change it amongst his family 
  and acquaintances.
Finally, I ask Allah to give you and this woman a halaal (lawful 
  and good) and blissful life, full of imaan (faith) and taqwa (piety - God-fearing) 
  and enriched with righteous posterity. All success is from Allah.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
126,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/126,"Conditions for performing forbidden act under necessity and engaging in 
riba transactions","Here in Singapore, the Muslims have very little, if not any, chance to participate in 
non-interest based transactions. What advice can you give to us who have no choice but 
to be involved in these transactions for our basic needs?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah: 
Every Muslim has to implement Islamic law, with all possible means, in all affairs, being social, 
economical, etc., in accordance with the verse: (interpretation of the meaning) ""Say: My prayer, my 
sacrifice, my life and my death are for Allah"". 
On certain occasions Muslims may be ruled by a non-Islamic system, which makes it very difficult 
for them to practice their religion. Their example may be similar to that predicted by the prophet,  (peace be upon him):
"" There will come a day where a Muslim holding fast to his deen (religion) is like he who is 
gripping a hot coal"" (Al-Tirmidhi, sahih). 
When a Muslim is faced with such a situation, he should hold fast to the teachings of the Qur'an, 
keep himself within a good Muslim community, and strive his best to implement Islam, asking Allah's 
forgiveness for things he could not implement. Allah, the Merciful, has stated that (interpretation of 
the meaning): 
""Allah does not require from a soul more than what it can bear"". 
When the situation becomes too difficult and over-bearing, a Muslim enters in a state of ""adversity"" 
or ""necessity"" (al-dharoorah) where unlawful things (al-mahdhooraat) become permissible. This is a 
great rule in Islam which reflects its mercy and appreciation to its followers. However, this issue is 
very sensitive as many Muslims, out of their ignorance, mistreat this rule. For example they neglect 
the corollary which says: ""The state of necessity should be dealt with in proportion to its measure."" 
Therefore it is very important to mention the constraints and conditions under which the rule of 
necessity is applicable. Some of these are:
That the level of harm associated with the unlawful action be less than that caused by the state 
of dharoorah.
That the permissible degree or amount of the unlawful action he is allowed to commit be just 
enough to get him out of the state of dharoorah.
That there is no other alternative in facing the state of dharoorah other than committing the 
unlawful act.
That the duration of the concession be restricted to the duration of its cause.
That the dharoorah is actually existing and not only anticipated or expected. 
When someone is faced by dharoorah and all its conditions and constraints are observed then 
the unlawful thing becomes lawful to him.
Here are few practical examples to illustrate the above:
It is permissible for the Muslim to eat from the dead animal if he finds nothing halaal to eat, and 
he will die if he doesn't eat
It is permissible for a Muslim to utter the words of kufr (disbelief) when he is under a painful 
torturing that he cannot bear.
It is permissible to deposit the money at the banks to save them from being lost or stolen, 
although that is considered to be helping the banks in their haraam interest transactions.
It is permissible to enroll in car insurance (considering that most of the forms of car insurance 
are not acceptable in Islam) if he is in bad need to have a car and he is not allowed to drive one 
without insurance.
It is permissible to complain to the ""civil courts"" (although they may not be implementing the 
Islamic law) to obtain one's rights if they is no other means to do so, provided one has the 
sound belief that there is no judgment except that of Allah.
Since the question inquires about transactions in particular, it is worth noting the following:
It is never permissible to ask for riba nor to accept it under any circumstances. Such unlawful 
action is not permissible under any need.
Minimizing the risk, or having more convenience are not valid excuses to enter into unlawful 
contracts, like those involving riba.
Improving the income or promoting the profits are also not valid excuses to adopt unlawful 
ways of earning. Let's remember that a little blessed halaal earning is better than many folds of 
haraam earning.
Finally we have to say that it is the duty of Muslims everywhere to strive to find lawful alternatives to 
alleviate the state of dharoorah and save themselves from the need to adopt unlawful ways.
We ask Allah to give us of His bounties what keeps us sufficed and satisfied, and not to make us in 
need of anyone other than Him. Ameen.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
127,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/127,Permissibility of women visiting graves,Our extended family seem to de divided on the issue of women visiting graves. Some say it is perfectly okay and do so and some say it is not permitted and do not visit graves. Please let me know if it is permissible for women to visit graves.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Paying visits by Muslim men to cemeteries is a practice of the sunnah, and it reminds one of his destiny so that he may strive for it. As the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:
""I [once] had forbid you from visiting graves, [and I now enjoin] you to do so, so that the visit may serve as a beneficial reminder."" (related by Muslim and others)
and in the version of al-Haakim:
"" for [such visits] soften the heart, bring tears to the eyes, and serve as a reminder of the Hereafter, [but be careful] not to speak forbidden expressions [i.e. while visiting]."" (Sahih al-Jaami' 4584)
Concerning visits to cemeteries by women, scholars have varied opinions on this issue:


it is allowed or preferred and their case is similar to that of men


it is makrooh (reprehensible), which is the opinion of jumhoor ul-'ulemaa' (the majority of the scholars)


it is forbidden, this one probably being the strongest opinion, as indicated by al-hadith al-sahih in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:


""Allah has cursed women who frequent graves,"" related by Ahmed and Tirmidhi and Ibn Maajah and in one version,
""Allah has cursed women who visit graves and those who build mosques and place lights upon them."" (related by Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi, al-Nisaa'i and al-Haakim)
This condemnation would warrant the validity of the argument against women visiting cemeteries as the lawmaker (i.e. Allah) would not condemn something that is permissible or reprehensibleonly that which is forbidden completely.
Regarding what would be the reason for this condemnation, the scholars have cited two main arguments:


Firstly, that women for the most part are emotionally weaker in accepting calamities and perhaps being in sight of her dear one's graves may break into wailing and loud weeping, which would be detrimental to her religious character and harmful for her body as well.


Secondly, cemeteries are oftentimes isolated places which may not be safe for someone being alone, possibly exposing a woman to people of corrupt or loose moral character.


In summary, the rationale behind this prohibition is that women are often not as strong emotionally in the face of calamities, and not visiting graves prevents them from the trial and from being exposed to unnecessary fitnah.

Some change their names to names of angels like Jibril or Mikail, etc. According to the 'aqidah of Ahl-us-Sunnah, angels are neither male nor female. If one says they are male, this is bid`ah and if one says they are female, this is kufr. 
So, I would like to know in light of all of this, what is the proper status of changing one's name to the name of an angel. Is it haram, makruh, mubah, etc.? Please help me with this answer for I have been asking and I have yet to receive a response. May Allah reward you for your answer! What advice would you give someone who has changed his or her name to the name of an angel?","It is preferable not to use the names of the angels, and that we follow the rightly-guided forefathers in the naming of our children and in the naming of those who accept Islam among the non-believers.",,"Praise be to Allah.Ibn al-Qayyim said in his book ""Tuhfat al-Mawdud fi Ahkam al-Mawlud"" in the second chapter under ""What is preferred among the names and what is considered reprehensible among them"" said:
“... and among them are the names of the angels such as Jibrail and Mikail and Israfil, it is makruh to name human beings with these names. Ash'had said: Imam Malik (may Allah have mercy upon him) was asked regarding naming someone the name Jibril; he abhorred it and it didn't please him; al-Qai `Iyad said: ""... and others allowed it."" Abdul-Razzak said in al-Jami' via Ma`mar: ""I said to Hammad ibn Abi Sulayman what would you say regarding a man whose name is Jibril or Mikail, and he responded, 'There is no objection.' (la bas bi-hi)""
Regarding the hadith: ""la tusammow bi-asma al-malaikah"" (""don't name yourselves with the names of the angels ""),  al-Bukhari has said that the validity of its chain of narration is questionable. This means that the hadith would not be considered sahih.” (""Tuhfat al-Mawdud,  p. 83)
In al-Mawsu'ah al-Fiqhiyya most of the scholars have ruled that using the names of the angels like Jibril and Mikail is not makruh (disagreeable or reprehensible). Imam Malik, on the other hand, has ruled that it is makruh.” (Al-Mawsu'ah al-Fiqhiyya, al-Kuwait, Vol 11:334)
Some have stated that the meaning of Jibril is Abdullah and likewise Mikail. See Tafsir Ibn Kathir under verses numbers 97-98 in Surat al-Baqarah.
Thus, based on what has been presented, it is preferable not to use the names of the angels, and that we follow the rightly-guided forefathers in the naming of our children and in the naming of those who accept Islam among the non-believers. The most preferred names, no doubt, are ‘Abdullah and ‘Abdul-Rahman as has been related in the sound hadith.

The Beast","Praise be to Allah.Three major signs of the Day of Judgement 
There follows a brief description from the Quran and authentic Sunnah narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about Gog and Magog, the Antichrist, and the Beast which are three major signs that will precede the Hour and will come at the end of time just before the Day of Resurrection.
The Antichrist (Al-Dajjal)
The Dajjal – a man created by Allah, who will appear at the end of time because of something that makes Allah angry. He will spread corruption on earth and will claim divinity, calling on people to worship him. 
People will be tested by the extraordinary powers that Allah will grant him, such as causing rain to fall, reviving the earth with vegetation and extracting the treasures of the earth. 
The Antichrist will be a young man with a ruddy complexion, short of stature, with curly hair. He will be one-eyed; his right eye will be flat and his other eye will have a thick piece of flesh over it. Written between his eyes will be the word “Kafir” (disbeliever). Most of those who follow him will be Jews. He will meet his end at the hands of ‘Isa ibn Maryam (Jesus the son of Mary) who will kill him with a spear in Lod, which is in Palestine.
Gog and Magog
Yajuj and Majuj are two disbelieving tribes from among the sons of Adam. They have wide faces and small eyes. They used to spread mischief on earth, so Allah gave Dhu’l-Qarnayn the power to build a barrier to detain them. They will keep on digging at it until Allah gives them permission to come out at the end of time, after ‘Isa (peace be upon him) has killed the Dajjal. 
Gog and Magog will emerge in huge numbers and will drink up the lake of Tiberias (in Palestine). They will spread mischief on earth and no one will be able to resist them. Jesus (peace be upon him) and the believers with him will take refuge in Mount Tur until Allah destroys Yajuj and Majuj by sending worms that will eat their necks. Then Allah will send rain to wash away their bodies into the sea and cleanse the earth of their stench.
The Beast
Al-Dabbah is a great creature which Allah will cause to emerge when the people become corrupt. It will speak to mankind and exhort them, having the ability to reason and speak.

Second of all, regarding the ruling on eating the meat found in non-Muslim countries, please refer to question # 103 .
Thirdly, a Muslim should be clever and sagacious in choosing the appropriate words and gentle-mannered approach to inform such a kind person of the place where one can buy ""halaal"" meat.  Since he is already spending money on the meat whether he buys Islamically-slaughtered meat or otherwise, your guiding him to the appropriate place preserves the benefits and interests from all facets, i.e.:  not refusing his gift; and achieving the permissibility of eating the meat.  In fact, it would be a wise idea even for the meat he buys for himself and his house, as it will be better and healthier.  Perhaps you could approach him with the idea as a suggestion and not as a firm requirement, explaining to him the reasons behind it both from the point of view of the Islamic shari'ah as well as health reasons.  Thus, it would not be something you are presenting as forcing your opinion upon him; rather, you would express the importance of the issue for you, while at the same time complimenting and praising him for his generosity, expressing your embarrassment for having opened the subject.  I would expect such a generous man to accept a well-mannered approach, don't you think?",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).  Examples of such linking are in the adhan for salaat and in the iqaamah for it.  Additionally, in a hadith the prophet 
 
(peace be upon him) teaches:

“Islam was built upon five pillars:  to witness that there is no deity except Allah, and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah… .”  

It represents what a mukallaf (one who is legally capable, liable for one’s actions, and obliged to perform required acts, which in Islamic law, shari’ah, starts at puberty) is required to believe.  It must be understood together, and are pronounced together as a testimony of belief.  As for writing it interwoven, nothing is available neither in the Book of Allah nor in the Sunnah of the Prophet 
 
(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).  As a result, there is great danger in this.  For it has a resemblance to the false precept in the Christian faith of trinity, and the concept that the father and the son and the holy spirit are one deity.  Further, it could be construed as an emblem representing the false faith of the unity of existence.  In addition, it may be used as support for the extremism in the Prophet 
 and worshipping him with Allah.  

Therefore, writing the name of Allah (the Most High) with the name of his prophet Mohammed 
(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in this way, i.e. making the letters of their names interwoven and the crossing of the letters of each of their names with the other, must be prevented.

Bearing witness “la ilaha illa Allah” and that “Muhammadun Rasul Allah” is the first pillar of the five pillars of Islam. And the meaning of “la ilaha illa Allah” is that nothing worshipped is worthy of worship except Allah—it is simultaneously a denial and affirmation. “la ilaha” is denial of all worship other than that of Allah. “illa Allah” is affirmation that all worship is for Allah Alone without partners.
Meaning of “Muhammad Rasul Allah”
As for the declaration, “Muhammadun Rasul Allah ,” its meaning is the assertion of the message of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and to believe in it and to adhere to it by speech, action and faith, and to avoid all that is against it, whether it be sayings, actions, or intentions.

Is their Shirk considered shirk al-akbar (great and serious act of disbelief by associating other beings with Allah’s supremacy)? Is alliance with them treated the same as alliance with true non-believers?,,,"Praise be to Allah.If the condition of those with whom you live is as you mentioned, appealing for help from other than Allah, such as appealing for help from the dead and the non-living or the trees or stones or planets and the like, then they are committing the greatest shirk which causes expulsion from the community and faith of Islam.  It is not allowed to ally with them just as it is not permissible to ally with non-believers.  Praying behind them is not valid. It is not allowed to mix socially with them nor to reside amongst them except for the one who calls them to the truth with knowledge, and sees hope that they will accept and that their religious condition will become correct due to his efforts.  Otherwise, it becomes obligatory for him to abandon them and to join a different community in which he can work with on establishing the fundamentals of Islam and its branches and reviving the example of the Prophet 
 (peace be upon him).  If he is not able to find the proper community, he should seclude himself from all communities, even if he experiences harshness, as has been related by Huthaifa (may Allah be pleased with him), who said:

So I said, O Messenger of Allah, we used to be in ignorance and evil but Allah gave us this goodness, so is there evil after this goodness?  He said: “Yes”.  So I said is their goodness after this evil?  He said “Yes and it has some darkness”  I said what is its darkness?  He said: “A people following an example other than my example and calling to a guidance other than my guidance; you would agree with some of what they do and disagree with some.”  So, I said is there any evil after that goodness?  He said: “Yes, callers on the doors of Jahanam  (the Hellfire); whoever answers their call to it are thrown in it.”  So, I said:  O Messenger of Allah describe them to us.  He said: “They are from amongst us and they speak with our tongues”  I said: O Messenger of Allah, what do you command me to do if this happens in my time.  He said: “Adhere to the community of Muslims and their leader.”  So, I said: What if there weren’t a community of Muslims nor a leader?  He said: “Then seclude yourself from all the communities, even if you were to bite on the root of a tree until death”

182,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/182,Ruling on loving non-Muslims,"Assalamu'alaikum. I am very in love with my girlfriend, a Chinese non-Muslim.We've 
been together for 5 years and planned to be wed soon. The problem is she is the eldest 
in her family and by tradition has to look after her parents who are non-Muslim.I have 
tried to convert them to the Islamic faith but they refused to submit to Islam. As a 
Muslim, I respect their decision but will I be doing a sin if they continued to live with my 
girlfriend and I after we wed. I deeply love and respect them even though they rejected 
our religion as they are my girlfriend's parents. They however were understanding 
enough to not keep idols and deities in the house after we wed but they love to eat pork 
(just like any other Chinese) What am I supposed to do? My girlfriend doesn't eat pork 
anymore and she has submitted to Islam willingly but she is concerned about changing 
her name as her parents want her to keep her original name(i.e. Wong Wan Pei). Can this 
be allowed?",,,"Praise be to Allah.All praise is due to Allah. First of all, we praise Allah the most glorified that He guided this woman to 
Islam and that you are now allowed to marry her under Islamic law (shari'ah). May Allah the Almighty 
help you to remain firm toward your faith. Out of compassion and caring for your sake, please allow 
me to reproach a particular aspect of your question, which is that you did not indicate any regret on 
your part regarding the sinful and forbidden relationship of taking a girlfriend and continuing with her 
in a friendship that angers and displeases Allah regardless of the extent of that friendship. 
Your question focused on a secondary issue regarding the ruling on changing one's name which is 
not as serious as what you have practiced for the past five years. Allah the most glorified has 
forbidden such an indecent relationship in the Qur'an (interpretation of the meaning, ) 
""not committing fornication, nor taking them as lovers (i.e. girlfriends)"" (Al-Maa'ida, 5:5) 
So, it is obligatory upon you to repent to Allah and to regret what has passed and to have the firm will 
not to return to the same action again, and to do good deeds and perform acts of worship to expiate 
the evils of that sin, and Allah is surely forgiving and merciful. (Please see also similar discussion of 
this issue in question #61) 
As for your statement: ""I deeply love my girlfriend's parents even though they rejected our religion,"" 
by Allah it is extremely astonishing how a Muslim man that believes in Allah and the last day can love 
people who are non-believers that don't believe in Allah and the last day and don't forbid what Allah 
forbids and don't practice the religion of truth and also refuse the religion of Islam??! Is this not a 
clear violation of Allah's statement in the Qur'an in surat al-Mujadlilah 58:22 (interpretation of the 
meaning): 
""You will not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, making friendship with and 
loving those who oppose Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad- 
 Peace and Blessings of 
Allah be Upon Him), even if they are their fathers or their sons or their kindred"" 
We are not saying to you curse them or pick up arms against them; however, it is obligatory upon 
you to abhor them for their disbelief and their denial of the Lord of the worlds and to hate the invalid 
and untruthful religion that they are practicing. On the other hand, there is no objection for you to 
treat them with kindnesswhile disliking them in your heartand to be amicable towards them so 
that perhaps Allah will guide them through you. You will find no conflict or contradiction between 
these two ideas if you consider them carefully. 
Furthermore, there is no objection to her parents living with you after marriage if they do not perform 
forbidden acts in the home (e.g., eating pork, drinking alcohol, etc.) 
As for the question raised at the end of your letter regarding changing her name, the answer is: if the 
name of the person has a forbidden meaning, like the name of an idol or one of their deities or a name 
that means worshipping other than Allah, such as Abdul-Maseeh (worshipper of Jesus 
 the 
messiah) or Abdul-Hussain (worshipper of Hussain) then it is mandatory to change it. However, if its 
meaning is permissible and not objectionable, e.g. if it means one of the colors such as red or green 
or a vocation like carpenter or baker, then it is OK and it is not obligatory to change it. However, if 
changing the name in official documents would cause the person much distress or harm, then it 
suffices to change it amongst his family and acquaintances. 
Finally, I ask Allah to give you and this woman a halaal (lawful and good) and blissful life, full of 
imaan (faith) and taqwa (piety - God-fearing) and enriched with righteous posterity. All success is 
from Allah.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
183,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/183,Ruling on a menstruating woman entering rooms etc. attached to the mosque,"In America there is a mosque which
      consists of three levels or floors. The top floor is the women’s prayer hall, the
      floor beneath it is the main prayer hall, and the floor beneath that is a kind of
      basement, in which there are washrooms, a room for Islamic magazines and publications, and
      classrooms for women; there is also an extra place for women to pray.Is it permissible for menstruating women to enter this lower level?Also, there are pillars in the mosque which interrupt the rows of
      worshippers, splitting a row into two halves. Does this break the row or not?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If the building you describe was intended as a mosque,
    and the people on the higher and lower floors can hear the voice of the Imaam, then the
    prayer of all of them is valid. In this case it is not permissible for menstruating women
    to sit in the place that is prepared for prayer in the lower level, because it is part of
    the mosque. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
“I do not make the mosque permissible for menstruating women and
    those in a state of ritual impurity.” 
As for a menstruating woman passing through the mosque for some
    purpose, as long as she takes care to ensure that no blood leaks, then there is nothing
    wrong with this, because Allâh says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… Approach not As-Salaah (the prayer)… when you are
    in a state of Janaabah (i.e., when you are in a state of sexual impurity and have not yet
    taken a bath) except when travelling on the road (without enough water, or when passing
    through a mosque)…” [al-Nisa’ 4:43]
And it was reported that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) told ‘Aa’ishah to fetch his prayer rug from the mosque, and
    she said that she was menstruating. He SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    told her: “Your menstruation is not in your hand.”
But if it was not the intention of those who established this mosque
    that the lower floor was to be part of the mosque, but it was to be a storeroom or to
    serve some other purpose, as mentioned in the question, then it does not come under the
    rulings governing mosques. It is permissible for menstruating woman and those who are in a
    state of impurity to sit there. There is nothing wrong with praying there in the places
    that are pure (taahir) and are not part of the washrooms, as it is permissible to pray in
    all clean places where there is no shar’i reason not to pray. But anyone who prays
    there cannot be considered to be following the imaam who is praying on the upper floor, if
    he cannot see him or any of the people who are praying behind him, and because this is not
    a part of the mosque, according to the more correct scholarly opinion.
With regard to the pillars which interrupt the rows, they do not
    adversely affect the prayer, but if it is possible to form the rows in front of or behind
    the pillars so that the row will not be interrupted, this is better. And Allaah is the
    source of strength.","Shaykh Ibn Baaz Fataawa Islamiyyah, p. 241, 242"

“Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write (i.e. Muhammad) whom they find written with them in the Tawraat (Torah) (Deut, xviii 15) and the Injeel (Gospel) (John, xiv 16), — he commands them for Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained); and forbids them from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); he allows them as lawful At‑Tayyibaat (i.e. all good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), and prohibits them as unlawful Al‑Khabaa’ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), he releases them from their heavy burdens (of Allaah’s Covenant with the children of Israel), and from the fetters (bindings) that were upon them. So those who believe in him (Muhammad), honour him, help him, and follow the light (the Qur’aan) which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful

Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary (tafseer) on this verse:
“ ‘Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write whom they find written with them in the Tawraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)’ – this is a description of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the books of the Prophets who gave their nations the glad tidings of his coming and commanded them to follow him. This description is still there in their books and their scholars and rabbis know it. Imaam Ahmad narrated: Ismaa’eel told us from al-Jareeri from Abu Sakhr al-‘Aqeeli, a man from among the Bedouin told me, I brought a milch-camel to Madeenah during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). When I had sold her, I said, “Let me meet this man [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)] and listen to him.” I met him walking between Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, and I followed them until they came to a Jewish man who was reading from a scroll of the Torah, consoling himself for the plight of his son who lay dying, a boy who was very handsome and good looking. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ‘I ask you by the One Who revealed this Torah, do you find any mention in this book of yours of my attributes and my coming?’ The man gestured with his head to indicate ‘No’. But his son said, ‘Yes indeed, by the One who revealed the Torah, we do find mention of your attributes and your coming in our book, and I bear witness that there is no god except Allaah and that you are the Messenger of Allaah.’ [The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)] said, ‘Keep this Jew away from your brother.’ Then he took care of shrouding him and praying [the funeral prayer] over him.” This is a qawiy jayyid hadeeth.
 It was narrated that ‘Ataa’ ibn Yassaar said: “I met ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr and said, ‘Tell me about the attributes of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) described in the Torah.’ He said, ‘Yes, by Allaah he is described in the Torah as he is described in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad) as a witness, as a bearer of glad tidings, and as a warner” [al-Fath 48:8] – and as a saviour to the unlettered; you are My slave and My messenger; your name is al-Mutawakkil; you are not harsh and aggressive; Allaah will not take him (in death) until He has straightened a crooked nation through him so that they will say that there is no god except Allaah, and has opened hard hearts, deaf ears and blind eyes.’”  ‘Ataa’ said: “Then I met Ka’b (who was one of the People of the Book who had become Muslim) and I asked him about that, and he told me exactly the same, not even one letter was different…” 
Al-Bukhaari narrated in his Saheeh that ‘Ataa’ ibn Yassaar said: “ I met ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas (may Allaah be pleased with him) and said, ‘Tell me about the description of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the Torah. He said, ‘‘Yes, by Allaah, he is described in the Torah in some of the same terms as he is described in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad) as a witness, as a bearer of glad tidings, and as a warner” [al-Fath 48:8] – and as a saviour to the unlettered; you are My slave and My messenger;  your name is al-Mutawakkil; he is not harsh and aggressive, and he does not make a noise in the market-place; he does not repay evil with evil, rather he overlooks and forgives; Allaah will not take him (in death) until He has straightened a crooked nation through him so that they will say that there is no god except Allaah, and has opened hard hearts, deaf ears and blind eyes.’”
(al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 2125)
 Allaah did not send any Prophet without taking from him the covenant and promise that if the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) were to appear during his lifetime, he would follow Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).
 Allaah says in Soorat Aal ‘Imraan (which no Christian reads with an open mind but he will become Muslim) (interpretation of the meaning):
“And (remember) when Allaah took the Covenant of the Prophets, saying: ‘Take whatever I gave you from the Book and Hikmah (understanding of the Laws of Allaah), and afterwards there will come to you a Messenger (Muhammad) confirming what is with you; you must, then, believe in him and help him.’ Allaah said: ‘Do you agree (to it) and will you take up My Covenant (which I conclude with you)?’ They said: ‘We agree.’ He said: ‘Then bear witness; and I am with you among the witnesses (for this).’”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:81] 
Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary (tafseer) on this verse:
It is said that Allaah took the covenant from the Prophets that they would confirm one another, and He commanded them to believe in one another. This is the meaning of believing and helping (‘you must, then, believe in him and help him’)… Taawoos said: Allaah took the covenant from the first Prophets that they would believe in the Message of the later Prophets…
The Messenger here is Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), according to the view of ‘Ali and Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them).
Allaah took the covenant from all the Prophets that they would believe in Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) if they met him, and He commanded them to take the same covenant from their nations.
