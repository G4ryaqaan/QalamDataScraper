I have been told by some people that while having intercourse with one’s wife, the room should be completely dark and one cannot take all the clothes off while copulating. Is it true?
May Allah guide us to the right path.","It is permissible for a husband and a wife to bathe together and to look at each other’s private parts. For evidence, see the detailed answer.","Can a husband see his wife's private parts?


Can husband and wife bathe together?","Praise be to Allah.Can a husband see his wife's private parts?
It is permissible for a woman to see all of her husband’s body and for a man to see all of his wife’s body, with no need to go into details, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those who guard their chastity (i.e., private parts, from illegal sexual acts), except from their wives or (the captives and slaves) that their right hands possess, - for then, they are free from blame; but whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.” [al-Muminun 23:5-7] (Fatawa al-Mar’ah by Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 121)
Can husband and wife bathe together?
Al-Bukhari reported in his Sahih (no. 250) that ‘Aishah said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and I used to bathe from one vessel.”
Al-Hafiz said in al-Fath: “Al-Dawudi interpreted this to mean that it is permissible for a man to look at his wife’s ‘awrah and vice-versa. This is supported by the report narrated by Ibn Hibban via Sulayman ibn Musa, who was asked about a man looking at his wife’s private parts. He said: ‘I asked ‘Aishah, and she referred to this hadith.’ This is evidence in this matter. And Allah knows best.”
I say: as for the words that some people attribute to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), that it is makruh (disliked) for a man to look at his wife’s private parts, this is not sahih. This includes the reports narrated from Ibn 'Abbas and Abu Hurayrah according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “When any one of you has intercourse with his wife , let him not look at her private parts, because this causes blindness, and let him not speak, because this causes muteness.” Ibn al-Jawzi said: “(This is) mawdu’ (fabricated).” (See al-Mawdu’at by Ibn al-Jawzi, 2/271-272).

We believe that adultery is not permissible not only in Islam, but also in all religions of Allah (God). I believe that the gentleman of nationality Xyz whom you are seeing is not serious in getting married, because if he were, he would have married you from the very beginning. In Islam, a man must respect the will of his parents, and in some cases he must obey them. You, in your present status, are not a member of his family. When you become his wife, then you are considered to be his family. Yet even then, if a father orders his son to divorce his wife because, for example, she has bad reputation or she is not a good Muslim, he must obey his father. My advice to you is to think seriously in embracing Islam, not for the sake of this man, but for the salvation of your soul and body from Hellfire. I believe by now, you have a good idea what Islam is, putting aside the bad example this gentleman has been setting. Therefor, you should stop seeing this man and you should become Muslim. If his love to you is genuine, he will propose to you. If he doesnt, then be sure that Allah will not leave you alone, and as He guided you to his religion, He will send you a good Muslim who will cherish you and give you a decent life as a wife not as a mistress.

      threatening to go ahead with the marriage whether they support him or not. Consequently my
      parents have threatened to cut off all ties from him, and cut off his inheritance.MY question is is my brother right to marry this girl with who he is
      intimately involved against my parents wishes?And is it right for my parents to disagree
      to the marriage on the terms i have stated and cut him off his inheritance?",,,"Praise be to Allah.With regard to the question of marriage, if you have any
    authority or influence over your brother and can convince him to give up the idea of
    marrying this woman, then remember that the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) commanded the Muslim to marry the woman who is religious. This woman
    is sinful and goes against the religion, she is not modest in her dress and she drinks
    wine, so he should not marry this woman.
With regard to the issue of his disobedience towards his parents, this
    sin is more serious than the one mentioned above. They have told him to obey Allah and to
    keep away from sin, so he must obey them and avoid going against their wishes. Your
    familys rejection of this marriage is quite correct according to shareeah,
    because they are enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and seeking to
    control one who is insane.
It is permissible, indeed it is necessary, to forsake him if doing so
    will stop him from going ahead, because marriage to this woman will keep him away from his
    religion. In America and in other kaafir countries there are many individuals in the
    Indian, Pakistani and Arab communities who have forsaken their religion and are no longer
    Muslim in anything but name.
As regards depriving him of his inheritance, this should not be done
    unless he becomes an apostate (leaves Islam). So long as he is within the pale of Islam,
    and does not do anything to put him outside of Islam or to make him a kaafir, then it is
    not permissible to deprive him of his inheritance, because this is something prescribed by
    Allaah, and as such it is not permissible to change it. And Allaah knows best,",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

    woman should see imam.....and u do understand that most of the women's area in mosque is
    arranged that it impossible to see imam but to hear from speakerswhich sometimes can break so that we cannot hear......or also one time happened to me thaty during traveling with my husband we
    stopped to pray at mosque and we were running a bit late so what happened was that when i
    went into prayer area there were no one there at all..and imam was saying takbir and i had
    no idea to which part of salah that takbir was reffered so i ended up confusing the oreder
    of salah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.When a woman prays behind an imaam, it is not essential
    for her to see him or some of the people who are praying behind him, but the rows have to
    be straight and the women who are praying should be within the boundaries of the mosque
    and be able to hear the voice of the imaam, so that they can follow him. If women are
    unable to hear the imaams voice for some reason, then they should pray individually,
    or in a jamaaah with other women, if they cannot hear the imaams voice or
    follow him. If a woman enters the mosque and hears the imaam saying takbeer, she should
    not follow him in saying takbeer until she knows whether he is in sujood or rukoo
    etc. The way out of this dilemma  if she cannot see the imaam or any members of the
    congregation  is to wait until the imaam says sami Allaahu liman
    hamidah, then she can pray with him. Ibn Abd al-Barr said in al-Kaafi
    (1/212): Everyone who can see or hear the imaam, and knows where he is in the
    prayer, and is behind him, it is permissible for him to follow him in prayer. This is the
    Maaliki view. And Ibn Qudaamah said: If there is a barrier between the imaam
    and the person who is following him, which prevents him from seeing the imaam or the
    people praying behind him, then there are two views narrated from Ahmad, one of which says
    that it is not valid for him to pray behind him and the second view is: it is valid
    because he can follow the imaam without seeing him, as a blind person does. But for his
    following the imaam to be valid, he has to be able to hear him. (al-Mughni,
    2/208)
In conclusion, if you are inside the mosque and you can hear the
    imaams voice and you know where he is in the prayer, then follow him, otherwise pray
    by yourself or with a group of women after the imaam finishes the prayer. 
    With regard
    to whether your prayer is valid or not, we asked Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih
    al-Uthaymeen, and he replied that to be on the safe side you should repeat the

3839,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3839,"Are physical medicines better, or ruqyah and spiritual medicine?","Modern medicine treats disease with physical medicine only. Is this sufficient, or should we use ruqyah? Which of them is better?",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is no doubt that man suffers psychological diseases, such as anxiety about the future and grief for the past. Psychological diseases may have a greater impact on the body than physical diseases. Treating these diseases by means of something prescribed in sharee’ah – i.e., ruqyah – is more successful than treating them by means of physical medicines, as is well known.
Among the means of treating them: the saheeh haseeth narrated from Ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him): “There is no believer who is stricken by anxiety, distress or grief, and he says, ‘Allahumma inni ‘abduka ibnu ‘abdika ibnu amatika, naasiyati bi yadika, maadin fiyya hukmuka, ‘adlun fiyya qadaa’uka, as’aluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw ‘allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw anzaltahu fi kitaabika aw asta’tharta bihi fi ‘ilm il-ghaybi ‘indaka an taj’ala al-Quran al-‘azeem rabee’a qalbi wa noora sadri wa jalaa’a huzni wa dhahaaba hammi wa ghammi (O Allah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave, son of Your maidservant. My forelock is in Your hand, Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You which You have named Yourself with, or taught to any of Your creation, or revealed in Your Book, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You, that You make the Holy Quran the life of my heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety and distress)’, but Allah will relieve him.” This is one of the medicines prescribed in sharee’ah.
Similarly, one may say, “Laa ilaaha illa anta, subhaanaka, inni kuntu min al-zaalimeen (none has the right to be worshipped but You (O Allah), Glorified (and Exalted) be You [above all that (evil) they associate with You]! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers)” [cf. al-Anbiyaa’ 21:87]
If you want to know more, please refer to the writings of the scholars on the topic of adhkaar (dhikr, remembering Allah), such as al-Waabil al-Sayyib by Ibn al-Qayyim, al-Kalim al-Tayyib by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, al-Adhkaar by al-Nawawi, and Zaad al-Ma’aad, by Ibn al-Qayyim.
But when faith grows weak, the soul’s acceptance of remedies prescribed in sharee’ah also grows weak. People nowadays have begun to rely on physical medicines more than on the spiritual remedies prescribed in Islam. But when faith is strong, the spiritual remedies prescribed in Islam have a more complete effect; their effect may be faster than that of physical medicines. We are all aware of the story of the man whom the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent on a campaign. He camped near some Arabs, but those people near whom he camped did not show him any hospitality. Allah willed that their chief should be stung by a snake, and they said to one another, “Go to those people who are camped (near us), maybe you will find a raaqi (one who recites ruqyah, i.e., incantations or prayers for healing) with them.” The Sahaabah said to them, “We will not recite ruqyah for your chief until you give us such and such number of sheep.” They said, “We agree.” Then one of the Sahaabah went and recited over the one who had been stung; he recited Soorat al-Faatihah only, then that person who had been stung got up as if he was released from a chain. 
This recitation of al-Faatihah had such an effect in this man because it came from a heart that was filled with faith. When they came back, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “How did you know that it is a ruqyah?”
But in our own times there is this weakness of religious commitment and faith, and people have started to rely on outward physical matters, and this is causing them further suffering.
On the other hand there are those who cheat people and deceive them,  claiming to be pious reciters of Quran, but they consume people’s wealth unlawfully. People are of two extremes, one which thinks that recitation of Quran has no effect at all, and the other extreme composed of cheaters who deceive people by reciting devious recitations, and some are moderate.
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, Fataawa Islamiyyah, 4/465, 466
But as there is no contradiction between using permissible physical medicines as prescribed by doctors and using spiritual medicines such as ruqyah and seeking refuge with Allah and other du’aa’s that are proven in sound reports, the two may be combined, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did. It was proven that he used both kinds of treatment, and he said, “Strive to pursue that which will benefit you and seek refuge with Allah, and do not feel helpless.” And he said: “Seek treatment, O slaves of Allah, but do not seek treatment with things which are haram.”",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

What does Islam say about begging for money?


Can we give charity to someone to do something haram?","Praise be to Allah.Can we give sadaqah to non-Muslims?
It is permissible to give charity – other than the obligatory charity (zakah etc.) – to poor non-Muslims, especially if they are relatives, on condition that they do not belong to people who are in a state of war against us and have not committed acts of aggression that would preclude our treating them kindly. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Allah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion nor drove you out of your homes. Verily, Allah loves those who deal with equity. It is only as regards those who fought against you on account of religion, and have driven you out of your homes, and helped to drive you out, that Allah forbids you to befriend them. And whosoever will befriend them, then such are the Zalimun (wrongdoers those who disobey Allah.” [Al-Mumtahinah 60:8-9]
 Asma bint Abi Bakr (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “My mother came to me when she was still a mushrikah – at the time when there was a peace treaty between Quraysh and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – accompanied by her father. I consulted the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), saying, ‘O Messenger of Allah, my mother has come to me and she is asking for help. Should I uphold the ties of kinship with her?’ He said, ‘Yes, uphold the ties of kinship with her.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, no. 2946)
 It was narrated that a Jewish woman came begging to `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) and she gave her something. The Jewish woman said to `Aishah, “May Allah protect you from the punishment of the grave.” `Aishah did not like that, and when she saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) she asked him about it and he said “No.” `Aishah said: “Then later on, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘It has been revealed to me that you will be tried in your graves.’” (Musnad Ahmad, no. 24815)
These two hadiths indicate that it is permissible to give charity to the non-Muslims. But it is not permissible to give zakah funds to the poor among the kuffar, because zakah can only be given to Muslims to spend on the poor and needy among them as mentioned in the ayah of zakah.
Imam al-Shafi`i said: “There is nothing wrong with giving charity to a mushrik as a nafilah (supererogatory) action, but he has no right to charity from the obligatory (zakah). Allah praised people who, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘… they give food, in spite of their love for it (or for the love of Him), to the Miskin (the poor), the orphan, and the captive’ [al-Insan 76:8].” (Kitab al-Umm, part 2)
Giving charity to poor Muslims is preferable and more befitting, because spending on them helps them to obey Allah, and it helps them in both their worldly and spiritual affairs. This helps to strengthen the bonds among Muslims, especially nowadays when the poor among the Muslims far outnumber the rich. And Allah is the One Whose help we seek.
What does Islam say about begging for money?
If the person who is asking for the money is Muslim and is definitely in need, then give him what you can in charity. The same applies even if he is not Muslim. But it is better for Muslims who are in need to refrain from begging in the streets. If they have no other choice, they should go to Islamic charity organizations which exist to channel charitable donations to the poor and needy. By the same token, those who want to give charity can also contact reliable charitable organizations so that their charity will reach those who deserve it.
Can we give charity to someone to do something haram?  
If the person who is asking for money –regardless of whether he is a Muslim or a non-Muslim – is asking for it in order to commit sin and buy something that is haram, or he is going to use the money to help him to do something haram, then it is not permissible to give that charity to him, because by doing so, one is helping him to commit that haram action. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression.” [Al-Maidah 5:2]

       Narrated by Abu Hurayrah the hadith doesn't say ""humans were alive
      before being born"". Only the souls were in heaven. This heaven is not the one people with good deeds go to in the hereafter.
      It is somewhere that we do not know. It's in the Lohmahfuz....only Allah knows. In simple
      words this place is like a ""bank"" where the souls created by Allah were placed.
      So when a woman is pregnant, at the point where Allah gives the soul to the creation in
      the womb, He will take one of these souls. So, there were good and bad souls. Let say, the
      bad soul is given to the creation, the baby is born and become a bad person. However, this
      grown up person can have a change in his/her destiny due to his/her deeds in his life.
      This is where the du'a plays a major role. The du'a and the inten",,,"Praise be to Allah.Imaam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him)
    reported in his Saheeh that Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with her)
    said: I heard the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saying:
    Souls are like conscripted soldiers; those whom they recognize, they get along with,
    and those whom they do not recognize, they will not get along with. (Saheeh
    al-Bukhaari, Kitaab Ahaadeeth al-Anbiyaa, Baab al-Arwaah junood mujannadah).
    Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his
    commentary on the hadeeth: Concerning the phrase Souls are like conscripted
    soldiers al-Khattaabi said: This may refer to their similarity as
    regards good or evil, righteousness or corruption. Good people are inclined towards other
    good people, and evil people are similarly inclined towards other evil people. Souls feel
    affinity with others according to the nature in which they were created, good or evil. If
    souls natures are similar, they will get along, otherwise they will not be on good
    terms with one another. It could be that what is being referred to is the beginning of
    creation in the realm of the unseen when, it is reported, souls were created before
    bodies, and used to meet one another and express their pessimism about the future. When
    souls have entered bodies (come to the physical realm) they may recognize one another from
    the past, and may be on friendly terms or otherwise based on that past experience.
Someone else said: What it means is that when souls are created,
    they are made in two parts, and when the bodies in which the souls reside meet in this
    world, they either get along together or do not, based on the way in which these souls are
    created in this world.
I say that this is not contradicted by the fact that some people who do
    not like one another at first may get along well later on, because the hadeeth is probably
    speaking about the moment of first meeting, which has to do with the original creation and
    nothing else. If they dislike one another at first but later come to like one another, it
    is because of something new, a new quality that makes them love one another after the
    initial dislike, such as a kaafir becoming a Muslim or a sinner being reformed. 
The phrase conscripted soldiers refers to different types
    or classifications, or groups brought together. Ibn al-Jawzi said: What we learn
    from this hadeeth is that when a person finds that he feels dislike towards someone who is
    known to be virtuous or righteous, he should try to find out the reason for that so that
    he can make the effort to rid himself of something undesirable. The opposite (if a person
    finds himself liking someone who is known to be evil) also applies. Al-Qurtubi said:
    Although they are all souls, they differ in different ways, so a person will feel an
    affinity with souls of one kind, and will get along with them because of the special
    quality that they have in common. So we notice that people of all types will get along
    with those with whom they share an affinity, and will keep away from those who are of
    other types. [Birds of a feather flock together  Translator]. We may
    also note that within any given group or type, people may get along with some and dislike
    others, and this is in accordance with issues or qualities that form the basis of love or
    hate.
We have narrated a mawsool report in Sunan Abi Yalaa, at
    the beginning of which is the story narrated from Amrah bint Abd al-Rahmaan,
    who said: There was a woman in Makkah who liked to joke, and she came and stayed
    with a woman in Madeenah who was like her. When Aaishah heard about this, she
    said, My beloved spoke the truth. I heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) saying and mentioned a similar hadeeth.
The hadeeth was also narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh, 4773.
    Al-Nawawi said: With regard to the words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him), Souls are like conscripted soldiers; those whom they recognize,
    they get along with, and those whom they do not recognize, they will not get along
    with, the scholars said that the meaning is groups gathered together, or different
    types. As for them getting along, this happens because of something in common between them
    that Allaah has created. It was said that they are similar attributes that Allaah has
    created in them, or that they were created in a group and then dispersed in their bodies,
    so people who have similar characteristics will like one another, and those who do not
    have similar characteristics will not like one another. Al-Khattaabi and others said: this
    getting along with one another has to do with what Allaah decreed from the outset about
    the ultimate destiny of souls, whether they will be among the blessed [in Paradise] or the
    doomed [in Hell]. Souls are of two opposing kinds, and when they meet in this physical
    world, they will either love or hate one another depending on the way they were created.

    towards other evil souls. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Some companies give away promotional gifts to other companies with whom
    they have connections, and some of these promotional gifts may be of high value, such as
    watches, and some may be of lesser value, such as ordinary pens, diaries, calendars or
    t-shirts with the company logo. What is the ruling on such things?
Let us suppose, for example, that a company is trying to market a specific
    product, such as lumber etc., so they go to other construction companies who buy lumber
    and give their employees items promoting the lumber company, so that this company will
    gain a reputation and be known to the employees of the construction company. These gifts
    may vary in value. Is it permissible for the employees of the construction company to
    accept these gifts?
He answered, may Allaah preserve him:
“I am afraid that this may involve toying with the market or that it
    may lead to treachery on the part of those who take these gifts. I think that it is not
    allowed.”
Question:
Could we say that if these gifts that the company gives out as advertising
    are given to the general public, such as calendars, for example, then they may take them,
    but if they are given exclusively to these employees or they are of high values, they
    should not take them?
The Shaykh said:
“This is our fatwa, but there is still the fear that this is done in
    order to toy with the market, for example, if there is a company working with you and they
    give you a gift like those they give to the general public, then this is OK, because it
    does not affect anyone. But if the gift is given in an attempt to win customers and make

      prayer, then it is not permissible. The scholars said: it is obligatory to
      stop one's prayer in order to save a negligent person from a fatal
      accident. For example, if you are praying and you see a snake approaching
      a man who is sitting down and has not noticed it. If it is heading for
      him, you have to stop your prayer and tell him so that he will not be
      bitten, possibly fatally. Or if you see a blind man walking in front of
      you whilst you are praying, and he is heading towards a well, and you are
      afraid that he may fall into it, then you have to stop your prayer and
      save him from that fatal accident, even if this means stopping your
      prayer. The same applies in cases of fire, etc. 
      
      
      But
      if the siren goes off for a minor matter which can be dealt with after
      completing the prayer and it will not be too late if you complete the
      prayer first, then it is not permissible to stop your prayer before you
      have completed it, because this accident can be dealt with after
      completing the prayer, without anyone coming to further harm. And Allaah
      knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
3895,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3895,Ruling on doing dangerous sports,"What is the ruling on doing dangerous sports, such as walking across tightropes in high places, jumping down from high places and staying in a cage with snakes?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Just as Islam has commanded the Muslim to 
          take care of his physical wellbeing, so too it forbids him to do any 
          kind of harm to his body. The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There should be no 
          harming or reciprocating harm.” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, Kitaab 
          al-Ahkaam, 2332; Ahmad, 2719; Maalik, 1234).
 The scholars have discussed the matter 
          of doing dangerous sports.
 The author of al-Durr 
          al-Mukhtaar said: “According to the Hanafi fiqh, ‘… all kinds 
          of dangerous sports are permitted to the one who is skilled and is most 
          likely to be safe from harm, such as archery/shooting, or hunting snakes. 
          Watching these sports is permitted in such cases.’” (See al-Durr 
          al-Mukhtaar, 6/404) 
 The first condition:
Complete skill and proficiency 
          in these kinds of sports. That cannot be achieved without a lot of repeated 
          practice and training, until that level of proficiency is achieved. 
          If this training results in neglecting obligatory duties or ignoring 
          Sunnah or recommended actions, then the view that it is haraam is applicable 
          in this case. But if no such neglect results from this practice and 
          training, then the view that it is permitted is applicable, and it is 
          also permitted to watch.
 The second condition:
That it is most likely that 
          the person will be safe. If there is the slightest possibility that 
          he will not be safe, or there is doubt that he will be safe, then the 
          sport is haraam, because it may lead to his death. We are forbidden 
          to reach towards such things, because Allaah says (interpretation of 
          the meaning):
“…and 
          do not throw yourselves into destruction…” 
[al-Baqarah 2:195] 
          
 The third condition.
The sport should not be done for money. It is haraam 
          to take payment for such sports, because this is regarded as consuming 
          people’s wealth unlawfully, as there is no benefit in it.
See Bughiyat al-Mushtaaq 
          fi Hukm al-Lahw wa’l-La’b wa’l-Sibaaq, p. 156-157. 
 I say: these things should be limited 
          to special occasions and celebrations, provided that they comply with 
          the conditions mentioned above. The soundness of this opinion is based 
          on the reports about the Ethiopians playing in the mosque, so these 
          matters should be restricted to the days of Eid. By analogy they may 
          also be done on other special occasions and celebrations. Similarly, 
          such sports are regarded as permissible on the condition that there 
          is no mixing of men and women, and that the ‘awrahs of the players are 
          not visible, and that no games of magic are involved.","See Qadaayaa al-Lahw wa’l-Tarfeeh, p. 295"
