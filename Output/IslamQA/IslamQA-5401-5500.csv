5410,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5410,What to Do If You Cannot Read Al-Fatihah in Prayer,"I am a native English speaker trying to learn Arabic, In Sha Allah. When I, Alhamdu lillah, embraced Islam, I memorized Surah Al-Fatihah from a transliteration of the Arabic. This fall I began to study more about salah (prayer) and in a book of fiqh I read that if a person omits or mispronounces 1 letter or vowel of Al-Fatihah in salah, his recitation is invalid. When I read this I became so worried, because although I am studying Arabic, there are some Arabic letters I still cannot pronounce at all, and some I cannot pronounce well. I started to listen to a taped recitation of Al-Fatihah and I love to hear it recited, but I feel discouraged because my recitation is so poor compared to the Qari's. Since I read that ruling, I have become so nervous in my recitation of Al-Fatihah in salah that instead of focusing on the meaning, I think about how poor my pronunciation is. When I hear myself mispronouncing letters, I go back over the ayat, trying to correctly pronounce them again. But what happens is that I either make the same mistakes again or make new ones! Often I end up reciting Al-Fatihah more than once or a certain ayah more than once because I feel so worried that my prayers are not being accepted because I can't pronounce some of the letters. I have become so nervous that sometimes I even mispronounce letters I usually can pronounce during my recitation. What should I do? May Allah reward you for any help you can give me.","Whoever is unable to pronounce al-Fatihah properly because of some defect in his tongue or because he is not an Arabic-speaker must learn to correct his pronunciation as much as he can.

What to do if you are unable to pronounce al-Fatihah properly


Ruling on one who is unable to recite al-Fatihah at all


Does a mistake in reciting al-Fatihah invalidate prayer?","Praise be to Allah.Is reciting al-Fatihah essential in prayer?
Reciting Surat al-Fatihah is a pillar or essential part of prayer – according to the correct scholarly view – and it is obligatory upon the imam who leads the prayer, the one who prays behind an imam and the one who prays on his own. 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever offers a prayer in which he does not recite Umm al-Kitab (i.e., al-Fatihah), it is defective” – and he said it three times. It was said to Abu Hurayrah, (What if) we are behind the imam? He said, Recite it to yourself, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, “Allah said: I have divided prayer between Myself and My slave into two halves, and My slave shall have what he has asked for. When the slave says: Al-hamdu lillahi rabbi l-alamin (All the praises and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of the ‘Alamn (mankind, jinn and all that exists), Allah says: My slave has praised Me.
And when he says: Ar-Rahman ir-Rahim (The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful), Allah (mighty and sublime be He) says: My slave has extolled Me
and when he says: Maliki yawm id-din (The Only Owner (and the Only Ruling Judge) of the Day of Recompense (i.e. the Day of Resurrection)), Allah says: My slave has glorified Me - and on one occasion He said: My slave has submitted to My power.
And when he says: Iyyaka na’budu wa iyyaka nasta’in (You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything)), He says: This is between Me and My slave, and My slave shall have what he is asking for.
And when he says: Ihdina’s-sirata’l- mustaqim, sirat alladhina an’amta alayhim ghayril-maghdubi alayhim wa la’ d-dallin (Guide us to the Straight Way. The way of those on whom You have bestowed Your Grace, not (the way) of those who earned Your Anger, nor of those who went astray), He says: This is for My slave, and My slave shall have what he has asked for.” (Narrated by Muslim) 
So the worshipper must recite Surat al-Fatihah properly in Arabic, because we are commanded to read and recite the Quran as it was revealed. 
What to do if you are unable to pronounce al-Fatihah properly
Whoever is unable to pronounce al-Fatihah properly because of some defect in his tongue or because he is not an Arabic-speaker must learn to correct his pronunciation as much as he can. 
If he cannot, then he is relieved of this obligation, because Allah does not burden people with more than they are able to bear. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.” [Al-Baqarah 2:286]
Ruling on one who is unable to recite al-Fatihah at all
If a person is unable to recite al-Fatihah at all or is unable to learn it, or he has just become Muslim and the time for prayer has come and there is not enough time for him to learn it, then he is given a way out in the following hadith: 
It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Abi Awfa said: “A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, teach me something of the Quran that will suffice me, for I cannot read.” He said, “Say: Subhan-Allah wa’l-hamdu Lillah wa la ilaha ill-Allah wa Allahu akbar wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah (Glory be to Allah, praise be to Allah, there is no god except Allah and Allah is Most great, there is no god except Allah and there is no power and no strength except with Allah).” The man made a grabbing gesture with his hand (indicating that he had learned a lot) and said, “This is for my Lord, what is there for me?” He said, “Say: Allahumma ighfir li warhamni wahdini warzuqni wa ‘afini (O Allah, forgive me, have mercy on me, guide me, and grant me provision and good health).” He made another grabbing gesture with his other hand and stood up.” (Narrated by al-Nasai, 924; Abu Dawud, 832. Its isnad was classed as jayyid by al-Mundhiri in al-Targhib wa’l-Tarhib, 2/430. al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar indicated that it is hasan in al-Talkhis al-Habir, 1/236) 
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“If a person does not know any Quran, and he cannot learn it before the time for prayer is over, then he must say Subhan-Allah wa’l-hamdu Lillah wa la ilaha ill-Allah wa Allahu akbar wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah (Glory be to Allah, praise be to Allah, there is no god except Allah, Allah is Most great and there is no power and no strength except with Allah), because Abu Dawud narrated that a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, “I am not able to learn anything of the Quran, so teach me something that will suffice me.” He said, “Say, Subhan-Allah wa’l-hamdu Lillah wa la ilaha ill-Allah wa Allahu akbar wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah.” The man said, “This is for my Lord, what is there for me?” He said, “Say: Allahumma ighfir li warhamni warzuqni wahdini wa ‘afini (O Allah, forgive me, have mercy on me, grant me provision, guide me, and give me good health).” But he does not have to do more than say the first five phrases, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) only said that, and he only told him more when he asked for more.” 
But if a person is able to recite part of al-Fatihah only, he should recite that which he is able to recite. And he has to repeat what he can recite well (i.e., so that the total number of what he recites will be seven verses, equivalent to the number of verses in al-Fatihah). 
Ibn Qudamah said: 
“It may be sufficient for him to say alhamdu-Lillah (praise be to Allah), la ilaha ill-Allah (there is no god but Allah) and Allahu akbar (Allah is most great), because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whatever you know of Quran, recite it, otherwise praise Allah, proclaim His Oneness and magnify Him.”  (Narrated by Abu Dawud)” (Al-Mughni, 1/289, 290) 
What you have read about the prayer being invalid if the worshipper mispronounces a single letter of al-Fatihah cannot be taken as general in meaning. Not every mistake in al-Fatihah invalidates the prayer; rather it cannot be invalidated unless something is omitted from al-Fatihah, or the pronunciation is changed in a way that distorts the meaning. Moreover, this ruling on the prayer becoming invalid applies to those who are able to recite al-Fatihah correctly or who are able to learn it but do not.
 As for those who are unable to do so, they should recite it as best as they can, and that does not affect them, because Allah does not burden a soul beyond its scope. One of the basic principles established by the scholars is that nothing is obligatory when a person is unable to do it. (See al-Mughni, 2/154) 
In this case, a person should recite al-Fatihah as best as he is able, and then glorify Allah, praise Him, magnify Him and proclaim His Oneness (by saying Subhan-Allah wa’l-hamdu Lillah wa Allahu akbar wa la ilaha ill-Allah), so that this will make up for whatever he has missed out of al-Fatihah. (See al-Majmu’, 3/375) 
Does a mistake in reciting al-Fatihah invalidate prayer?
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
Is the prayer of one who mispronounces al-Fatihah valid or not? 
He replied:  
“If a person mispronounces al-Fatihah in a way that does not distort the meaning, his prayer is valid, whether he is leading others in prayer or is praying alone. 
But with regard to the kind of mispronunciation that distorts the meaning, if the person knows the meaning, such as if he says ‘Sirat alladhina an’amtu ‘alayhim [meaning “The way of those on whom I have bestowed my grace”, instead of the correct version an’amta (The way of those on whom You have bestowed Your Grace)], and he knows that this verbal form is wrong, then the prayer is not valid. But if he does not know that he is distorting the meaning, and he thinks that this form is second person singular rather than first person, then there is a difference of scholarly opinion on this point. And Allah knows best.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa 22/443) 
He was also asked about when a person ends a word with –i that should end in –a when praying (or renders it genitive when it should be accusative). 
He replied: 
“If he is aware of what he is doing and he does it deliberately, then his prayer is invalid, because he is playing about in his prayer. But if he is unaware of that, then his prayer is not invalid, according to one of the two scholarly views.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 22/444) 
So you must try hard and keep practising it. You can do this by reciting it to another Muslim sister who can recite it well, and by listening to surahs recited by skilled reciters on tapes or broadcasts. 
There is no need to feel nervous and anxious, because Allah knows what is in people’s hearts, and He knows who is trying hard and making the effort, and who is lazy and heedless. 
The difficulty that you find in reciting Quran will increase your hasanat (good deeds) and rewards. It was narrated that ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who is skilled in reciting Quran will be with the noble and obedient scribes (i.e., angels) and the one who reads the Quran and struggles with it because it is difficult for him will have two rewards.” (Narrated by Muslim, 798) 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The one who struggles with it is the one who is hesitant in his recitation because he is not able to memorize it well. He will have two rewards: the reward for reciting it and the reward for his efforts in reciting it.  
There is no need to repeat verses more than once, because this is not what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did or taught. Rather that opens the door to waswas (whispers from the Shaytan), detracts from the prayer, makes you lose your focus, distracts you from pondering the meaning of the verses and makes the Shaytan happy, because from that he can find a way to make you suffer so that you will ultimately give up praying. But Allah is Most Gracious and Most Merciful, and He is more merciful towards us than we are to ourselves, and He does not burden us with more than we can bear.”

    inherit half of what the man does? I said because the man is supposed to support her financially. She said what if she were the one who
    is working? I said in any circumstance it is the male who is supposed to support her, and
    when he inherits wealth, then he supports her even if she has an independent income.) she
    would also ask what happens to souls when you sleep? I said Allah takes them.according to
    what I have read, she said so sometimes we wake up during the night, doesn't this
    contradict? I said NO!, and I told her that I am not knowledgeable about those things, and
    that there are more important things to know, such as matters of Aqeedah, worship, fiqh
    and so on.She said so how are you supposed to know that you are on the right path? All these discussions make me feel she is drifting away from Islam. I try
    to give her books, but she does not read.Yet she always wants me to tell her things. Also, my mother is trying to

Invite (mankind, O Muhammad) to the way of your Lord (i.e.
    Islam) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Quraan) and fair
    preaching [al-Nahl 16:125].
You have to bear your mothers insults with patience, as Allaah
    commanded His Prophet Muhammad 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to do, when He
    said (interpretation of the meaning):
So bear patiently (O Muhammad) what they say, and glorify the
    praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun, and before its setting

As for your answers to her questions, they are correct. With regard to
    waking up at night, although Allaah takes peoples souls when they sleep, there is no
    contradiction between the two, for the One Who is able to take the soul is able to put it
    back. This is why it is mustahabb for the person who wakes up from sleep to say:
    Al-hamdu Lillaah illadhi radda alayya roohi wa afaani fi jasadi wa
    adhina li bi dhikrihi (Praise be to Allaah Who has returned my soul to me, kept my

    to pay the mahr and provide accommodation for their womenfolk, etc. Women wait for someone
    else to take the initiative, unlike men. So it is not fair for them to receive the same
    share in the case of inheritance. Allaah is the most just of those who are just and the
    most wise of those who pass judgement.
I ask Allaah to make you steadfast (in Islam) and to reward you for
    your dawah. You have to be gentle with them and not do anything to provoke them. Do

My question is about wudu/ablution I am unable to grip with my hands. I have a health care provider in the morning after fajr who gives me a full bath daily. Is this sufficient for the whole day? I tried clean dust or sand but could not wipe my face completely and had a hard time putting hands in sand/dust. Please give advice.","If you cannot perform wudu, you can do taymmum. But if it is too difficult to do tayammum, then it is permissible to pray without wudu and tayammum.","Can you pray without wudu and tayammum?


Evidence for the permissibility to pray without wudu or tayammum","Praise be to Allah.Can you pray without wudu and tayammum?
Islam came to make things easy for people and not to burden them with things they cannot do. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned.” [Al-Baqarah 2:286]
Allah has enjoined wudu upon the Muslims, but because He knows that some of them are weak and unable to do it, He has granted them a concession and has prescribed tayammum as an alternative to water, and made it a means of purification for the Muslim. 
But if it is too difficult to do tayammum , then it is permissible to pray without wudu and without tayammum . This is like the case of one who cannot find a garment to cover his ‘awrah in prayer; it is permissible for him to pray without a garment. 
If someone can help you to do ghusl or wudu , then all well and good, and that will suffice you for the rest of the day so long as you do not break that wudu in any way. 
If you do tayammum for yourself or if someone else does it for you, it is sufficient to pass your hand over the dust, and wipe whatever you can of your face. 
You may also – because of hardship and sickness – put two prayers together if it is difficult for you to do wudu at the time of the second prayer. 
If it is not easy for you to do wudu or tayammum until the time for the prayer is nearly over, then you have to pray even if you did not purify yourself with either water or dust. 
Evidence for the permissibility to pray without wudu or tayammum
The evidence that it is permissible for a man to pray even if he cannot purify himself is as follows: 
It was narrated that `Aishah borrowed a necklace from ‘Asma and lost it. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent a man to find it, then the time for prayer came but they did not have any water, so they prayed then complained about that to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Then Allah revealed the verse of tayammum. Usayd ibn Hudayr said to A’ishah, “May Allah reward you with good, for by Allah there has never happened to you anything that you dislike but Allah brought something good for you and for the Muslims through it.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 329; Muslim, 367) 
In a report narrated by al-Tabarani and Abu ‘Awwanah, it states clearly that they prayed without wudu. 
`Aishah said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent Usayd ibn Hudayr and some others to look for a necklace that ‘Aishah had lost. The time for prayer came and they prayed without wudu. When they came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) they complained to him about that, then the verse of tayammum was revealed.” Al-Nufayli added: And Usayd ibn Hudayr said: “May Allah reward you with good, for by Allah there has never happened to you anything that you dislike but Allah granted relief for you and for the Muslims through it.” (Narrated by Abu Awwanah, 873; al-Tabarani, 131) 
This indicates that in the absence of water – which was the only means of purification before tayammum – it is permissible to pray without wudu, so it is more apt that it is permissible to pray in the absence of dust which is of a lower status than water. 
From this it may be understood that the person who is unable to purify himself – whether that is because there is no means of purification or because he is unable to find it or is unable to use it if it is present – is permitted to pray without purifying himself. 
Al-Bukhari included this hadith in a chapter entitled, Bab idha lam yajid ma-an wa la turaban (Chapter: if there is no water or dust). 
Ibn Rashid said: 
“It is as if the author is stating that tayammum is not prescribed if there is no dust, and that was after tayammum had been prescribed. It is as if he is saying that their ruling concerning the lack of the means of purification – which was water only – was the same as our ruling on cases when neither of the two means of purification, water and dust, is available. Hence we know that this hadith is suited to the heading, even though the hadith does not say that they had no dust, rather it says that they had no water. This indicates that prayer is obligatory for the one who has neither of the two means of purification, because the hadith shows that they prayed believing that it was obligatory to do so. If praying in such circumstances were not allowed, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have told them off for doing so. This is the view of al-Shafi’i, Ahmad, the majority of muhaddithin and most of the companions of Malik.” (Fath al-Bari, 1/440) 
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
“If no dust is available, this is as if tayammum is not prescribed, and there is no difference. They prayed without doing tayammum because tayammum had not been prescribed at that time. The same applies to one who prays without tayammum because he does not have the material with which to do tayammum. What is the difference between not having it and it not being prescribed? According to analogy (qiyas) and the Sunnah, the one who does not have it should pray according to his circumstances, for Allah does not burden any soul beyond its scope. And he should not repeat the prayer, because he did what he was commanded to do so he does not have to repeat it. This is similar to the case of one who does not stand or face the qiblah or cover himself or recite because he is unable to do so. This is what is implied by the texts and by analogy.” (Hashiyat Ibn al-Qayyim ‘ala Tahdhib Sunan Abi Dawud, 1/61) 
Ibn Qudamah said: 
“Because it is one of the conditions of prayer which is waived when one is unable to do it, as is the case with all the other conditions and pillars (essential parts) of the prayer. And he did what he was obliged to do as best he could, so he does not have to repeat it. This is like the one who is unable to cover himself and prays naked; or one who is unable to face the qiblah so he prays facing a different direction; or one who is unable to stand so he prays sitting.” (Al-Mughni, 1/157) 
Al-Shawkani said: 
“With regard to the phrase “so they prayed without wudu”, a number of scholars, including the compiler, understood this to mean that it is obligatory to pray even if neither of the two means of purification, water and dust, is available. It does not say in the hadith that they had no dust, rather it says only that they had no water, but the lack of water at that time was like the lack of water and dust, because there was no means of purification other than water.

    sell it to a person who it is known will use it for a haraam purpose. The same applies to
    all things that Allaah has permitted. For example, it is permissible to sell grapes to

    known that a person will use for haraam purposes something that it is permitted to sell,
    then it is not permissible to sell it to him, otherwise it is permissible.
If you were dealing in grapes, and a kaafir came to you wanting to buy
    some, and you did not know whether he was going to use them for food or to make wine, then

My country follows the teachings of Madhhab Imam Shafiee and therefore so too the people. There are instances where the teachings of the madhhab took precedent over the hadith and sunnah of the Nabi (s.a.w.). Which should I follow. eg. In Madhhab Imam Shafiee, the wudho is broken if a male purposely or accidentally touch a female either muhrim or not. I have come across a Sunnah Nabi(s.a.w.), who used to move Aishah's (r.a.) leg while performing the fajr prayers. eg. Muslims in my country are thougt that during the Haj, their niat for wudho to switch from the Madhhab Shafiee to that of Madhaab Hambali and perform the wudho as followers of Madhhad Hambali do. The reason for this is as stated in the example above. Is this right, switching from one Madhhab to another during performing the Haj. eg. In Madhhab Shafiee, its is sunat muakad to recite the Doa Qunut during Fajr prayers. Did the Nabi(s.a.w.) recite the Doa Qunut during his Fajr prayers. What is the hukum for ones that do not recite the Doa Qunut.",,,"Praise be to Allah.What is obligatory is to follow that which is indicated by the evidence (daleel) of the Quran and Sunnah, even if it differs from what the madhhab says. But it is essential to understand the Quran and Sunnah as they were understood by the Salaf, and not only by our understanding of them. What is meant by the Salaf is the Sahaabah and the Taabi’een.
 Concerning the example which you gave, touching a woman does not break Wudu at all, whether it is done with desire or not – because of the hadith that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) kissed one of his wives and then went out to pray, and he did not repeat his Wudu. But if a man emits something (madhiy) because of desire, then he has to do Wudu – not because of the act of touching, but because something came out from him.
 With regard to the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “…or you have been in contact with [lit. touched] women…” [al-Maa’idah 5:6] – this is referring to sexual intercourse, according to the correct view.
 2- There is no need to move from one madhhab to another. The obligatory duties of hajj should be performed as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) performed them, because he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Take your rituals from me.”
The correct view concerning Qunoot in Fajr prayer is that it is Sunnah at times of calamity only, i.e., if a disaster has befallen the Muslims or some of them, then it is mustahabb to do Qunoot and to pray to Allah to grant them relief. But under normal circumstances, the correct view is that this is not mustahabb, and this is what the daleel (evidence) refers to. So whoever does not do Qunoot, his prayer is still valid, even according to the Shaafa’is, may Allah have mercy on them.

How to recognize Allah","Praise be to Allah.There is nothing like unto Allah
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearer, All-Seer.” [al-Shura 42:11].
There is nothing like unto Him, nothing that is equal or comparable to Him or that can rival Him. He is far above any resemblance to any created being. Whatever crosses the mind of the son of Adam with regard to his Lord, He is greater than that. No creature can encompass Him, may He be glorified and exalted, or imagine what He looks like. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… and they will never encompass anything of His Knowledge.” [Ta-Ha 20:110]
The Muslim is not supposed to try to imagine or picture Allah; rather, he has to believe in the sublime attributes which befit His Might and Majesty in which there is none like unto Him.
Will the believers see Allah?
Part of the ‘aqidah (basic beliefs, creed) of the Muslims is that Allah cannot be seen in this world, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“No vision can grasp Him” [al-An'am 6:103]
But the believers will see Allah in the Hereafter , in the gathering-place where judgement will be passed, and in Paradise. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked – as it was reported in Sahih Muslim – “Did you see your Lord?” He said, “I saw Light.” According to another report: “Light, how could I see Him?” This is in accordance with what Allah said to Musa in Surah al-A’raf (interpretation of the meaning):
“ ‘You cannot see Me’” i.e., in this world.
Neither the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) nor anybody else has seen Allah with his own two eyes. In the Hereafter, when the people see Him in the place of gathering , they will fall down in prostration before His Might and Majesty. Seeing Him in Paradise will be the greatest of all the joys that the people of Paradise will experience.
How to recognize Allah
You have to recognize Allah by the Names and Attributes which He has told us about in His Book, and which His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us about. Do not occupy yourself with something that is beyond you; devote yourself instead to doing what your Lord has commanded you to do.

    The Muslim has to perform the prayers at the appointed
    times and it is not permissible to delay them for no reason, because Allaah
    says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, Al-Salaat (the prayer) is enjoined on the
    believers at fixed hours” [al-Nisaa’ 4:103], i.e. it is obligatory
    at specific times, and should not be brought forward or delayed. The timing
    is the most important condition of prayer: if a person is not able to fulfil
    some of the conditions of the prayer, he should still pray as best as he
    can, within the prescribed time, and he should not delay it. One of the
    things that indicate the importance of the times of prayer in sharee’ah is
    the fact that if a Muslim cannot find water, he should do tayammum
    (“dry ablution” using earth or sand) and pray, even if he is sure that
    he will find water after the time for that prayer has passed.
The fact that a child walks in front of his mother whilst
    she is praying does not have any effect on the prayer and does not make it
    invalid. It was reported that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) carried a small girl whilst he was praying, picking her
    up when he stood up and putting her down when he prostrated (sujood). This
    was reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim from Abu Qutaadah al-Ansaari: “The
    Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to
    pray whilst he was carrying Umaamah, the daughter of Zaynab bint
    Rasool-Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). According to
    the report of Abu’l-‘Aas ibn Rabee’ah ibn ‘Abd Shams, when he
    prostrated he put her down, and when he stood up he picked her up.” (Narrated
    by al-Bukhaari, no. 486, and Muslim, no. 844).
    
    It was also reported that he 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) allowed a small boy to ride on his shoulders and he
    still completed the prayer. This was reported by ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Shaddaad
    from his father: “The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) came out to lead us in either Maghrib or ‘Ishaa’ one
    night, and he was carrying Hasan or Husayn. The Messenger of Allaah 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came forward and put (the child)
    down, then he said Takbeer and started to pray. During the prayer, he
    prostrated and made his prostration long. My father said: ‘I raised my
    head and I saw the child on the back of the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) whilst he was prostrating, so I
    returned to my prostration.’ When the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) finished praying, the people said, ‘O
    Messenger of Allaah, during your prayer you prostrated for so long that we
    thought something had happened or that you were receiving Revelation.’ He
    said, ‘Nothing at all happened, but my son was riding on my back and I did
    not want to disturb him until he had had enough.’” (Narrated by
    al-Nisaa’i, no. 1192; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani – may Allaah have
    mercy on him – in Saheeh Sunan al-Nisaa’i, 1/246).

      required if the parents are young, healthy, and make alot of money, and
      have no need for their son? Does he still then need permission?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The basic principle with regard to jihaad is that it is fard
    kifaayah, i.e. if a sufficient number of people undertake this duty,
    then there is no sin on the rest of the community. If it is fard kifaayah,
    then the mujaahid is obliged to seek permission before going for jihaad. He
    has to seek his parents’ permission if they are Muslim, regardless of
    whether they are rich or not and regardless of whether they can do without
    his help or not, because the texts clearly state that he has to seek his
    parents’ permission. One such text was reported in al-Saheehayn
    from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr, who said that a man came to ask the Prophet
    
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) for permission to go for
    jihaad. He said, ‘Are your parents still alive?’ [The man said]
    ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘Then your jihaad is with them.’ Imaam Ahmad, Abu
    Dawood and Ibn Hibbaan narrated from Abu Sa’eed that the Messenger of
    Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent a man who had
    made hijrah from the Yemen back to his parents. He (the Prophet 
 (peace
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) said, ‘Did they give you
    permission?’ [The man] said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Go back to them and
    seek their permission, and if they give you permission, then go for jihaad,
    otherwise honour and respect them.’
The above applies in cases where jihaad has not become
    obligatory on every single person, i.e., fard ‘ayn. If jihaad
    becomes fard ‘ayn, then it is not obligatory to seek permission,
    because in the case of things which are fard ‘ayn, there is no need
    to seek the permission of anyone. Jihaad becomes fard ‘ayn
    when a person is in the battlefield, if the enemy invades a Muslim country,
    if the imaam appoints a person or urges him to fight, or if his particular
    skills are needed because he has good knowledge of military matters or

Thank you to explain me this issue (about the sellem it's clear) and is the hadith only apply for the sellem or also for the kouffar's greeting.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We appreciate your eagerness to learn; may Allah increase us and you in knowledge and acceptable righteous deeds. It was reported from Muaawiyah ibn Abi Sufyaan (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Whomever Allah wills good for, He enables him to understand the religion.
(Agreed upon).
In response to your question: His Excellency Shaykh Abd al-Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked the following question:
Nowadays, as a result of dealing with the West and the East most of whose people are kuffaar of different sects and religions they say the greeting of Islam (as-salamu alaykum) when they meet us in any place. What should we do with regard to them?
He (may Allah have mercy on him) replied:
It was reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Do not initiate the greeting of salam to the Jews and Christians, and if you encounter them in the street, push them to the narrowest part of the road.
(Narrated by Muslim). And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: If the people of the Book greet you with salam, say Wa alaykum (and also upon you). (Agreed upon). The People of the Book are the Jews and Christians; the ruling concerning the rest of the kuffaar is the same as the ruling concerning the Jews and Christians with regard to this matter, because there is no evidence (daleel) to indicate anything different.
So we should not initiate the greeting of salam to a kaafir at all; if he initiates the greeting of salam, then we should say wa alaykum in response, in obedience to the command of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). There is no reason why we cannot then say, How are you? Or, How are your children? as has been permitted by some of the scholars, including Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), especially when doing so serves an Islamic purpose such as encouraging him to take an interest in Islam so that he will be receptive to dawah, because Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
Invite (mankind, O Muhammad) to the way of your Lord (i.e. Islam) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Quraan) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better [al-Nahl 16:125]
And argue not with the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), unless it be in (a way) that is better (with good words and in good manner, inviting them to Islamic Monotheism with His Verses), except with such of them as do wrong [al-Ankaboot 29:46]
(Majmoo Fataawaa wa Rasaail Samaahat al-Shaykh Abd al-Azeez ibn Baaz Fataawaa al-Aqeedah, part 2, p. 1042)
Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said, with regard to initiating the greeting with a kaafir: A group i.e., of scholars said: it is permissible to initiate the greeting for a purpose, such as some interest that one hopes to achieve, or because one fears his harm, or because they are related by blood, or for some other reason that dictates that.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
