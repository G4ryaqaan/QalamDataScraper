Can you please clarify the situation and advise, if al-Masjid  al-Aqsa is different from the Dome of the Rock, why do we see its picture representing al-Masjid al-Aqsa at all Islamic places, and I (and many other Muslims) were completely unaware of the difference?","Al-Masjid al-Aqsa is the name for the whole of the place of worship built by Prophet Sulayman. The Dome of the Rock is situated in the middle of the plateau of al-Masjid al-Aqsa, which is in the southeastern part of the city of Jerusalem.","What is Al-Masjid al-Aqsa?


Who built al-Masjid al-Aqsa?


Who built the Dome of the Rock?


Difference between al-Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock","Praise be to Allah.What is Al-Masjid al-Aqsa?
Al-Masjid al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem) was the first of the two qiblahs (prayer direction), and is one of the three mosques to which people may travel for the purpose of worship. 
Who built al-Masjid al-Aqsa?
And it was said that Al-Aqsa Mosque was built by Sulayman (peace be upon him), as stated in Sunan al-Nasai (693) and classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Nasai. 
It was said that Al-Aqsa Mosque   existed before Sulayman (peace be upon him) and that Sulayman rebuilt it; this is based on the evidence narrated in al-Sahihayn from Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, which mosque was built on earth first?’ He said, ‘Al-Masjid al-Haram [in Makkah].’ I said, ‘Then which?’ He said, ‘Al-Masjid al-Aqsa.’ I said, ‘How much time was there between them?’ He said, ‘Forty years. So wherever you are when the time for prayer comes, pray, for that is the best thing to do.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3366; Muslim, 520)
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken on the Night Journey (Isra) to Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem), where he led the Prophets in prayer in this blessed mosque. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Glorified (and Exalted) be He (Allah) [above all that (evil) they associate with Him]
Who took His slave (Muhammad) for a journey by night from Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah) to Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem), the neighbourhood whereof We have blessed, in order that We might show him (Muhammad) of Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, lessons, signs, etc.). Verily, He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.” [al-Isra 17:1]
Who built the Dome of the Rock?
The Dome of the Rock was built by the caliph ‘Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan in 72 AH. 
It says in al-Mawsu’ah al-Filastiniyyah (4/203): 
“The name al-Masjid al-Aqsa was historically applied to the entire sanctuary (al-Haram al-Sharif) and the buildings in it, the most important of which is the Dome of the Rock which was built by ‘Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan in 72 AH/691 CE, which is regarded as one of the greatest Islamic historical buildings. But today the name is applied to the great mosque which is situated in the southern part of the sanctuary plateau.” 
It also says in al-Mawsu’ah (3/23): 
“The Dome of the Rock is situated in the middle of the plateau of al-Masjid al-Aqsa, which is in the southeastern part of the city of al-Quds (Jerusalem). It is a spacious rectangular plateau which measures 480 meters from north to south, and 300 meters from east to west. This plateau occupies approximately one-fifth of the area of the Old City of Jerusalem.” 
Difference between al-Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock 
The mosque which is the place of prayer is not the Dome of the Rock, but because pictures of the Dome are so widespread, many Muslims think when they see it that this is the mosque. This is not in fact the case. The Mosque is situated in the southern portion of the plateau, and the Dome is built on the raised rock that is situated in the middle of the plateau. 
We have already seen above that the name of the mosque was historically applied to the whole plateau. 
This is supported by the words of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) in Majmu’at al-Rasail al-Kubra, 2/61: 
“Al-Masjid al-Aqsa is the name for the whole of the place of worship built by Sulayman (peace be upon him). Some people started to give the name of al-Aqsa to the prayer-place which was built by ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab in front of it. Praying in this prayer-place which ‘Umar built for the Muslims is better than praying in the rest of the mosque, because when ‘Umar conquered Jerusalem there was a huge garbage dump on the rock, since the Christians wanted to show their scorn for the place towards which the Jews used to pray. So ‘Umar issued orders that the filth be removed and he said to Ka’b: ‘Where do you think we should build a place of prayer for the Muslims?’ He said, ‘Behind the rock.’ He said, ‘O you son of a Jewish woman! Are you influenced by your Jewish ideas! Rather I will build it in front of it.’
Hence when the imams of this ummah entered the mosque, they would go and pray in the prayer-place that was built by ‘Umar. With regard to the Rock, neither ‘Umar nor any of the Sahabah prayed there, and there was no dome over it during the time of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs. It was open to the sky during the caliphate of ‘Umar, ‘Uthman, ‘Ali, Mu’awiyah, Yazid and Marwan… The scholars among the Sahabah and those who followed them in truth did not venerate the rock because it was an abrogated qiblah… rather it was venerated by the Jews and some of the Christians.” 
‘Umar denounced Ka’b al-Ahbar and called him the son of a Jewish woman because Ka’b had been a Jewish scholar and rabbi, so when he suggested to ‘Umar that he should build the mosque behind the rock, that was out of respect for the rock so that the Muslims would face it when praying, and veneration of the rock was part of the religion of the Jews, not the religion of the Muslims. 
The Muslims’ fondness for the picture of the Dome may be because of the beauty of this building, but this does not excuse them from the resulting mistake of not distinguishing between the Mosque and the buildings that surround it. 
This may be one of the plots and tricks of the Jews, because of their veneration for the rock and their facing it in prayer. Or it may be in order to give importance to the Rock so that they can fulfil their desire to build the so-called Temple of Solomon on the ruins of al-Masjid al-Aqsa. This is by making the Muslims think that al-Masjid al-Aqsa is the Dome of the Rock, so that if the Jews start to destroy al-Masjid al-Aqsa and the Muslims denounce them for that, they will tell them, “Al-Masjid al-Aqsa is fine,” and will show them a picture of the Dome of the Rock. Thus they will achieve their aims and be safe from the Muslims’ criticism. 
We ask Allah to restore the Muslims’ power and glory, and to cleanse al-Masjid al-Aqsa of the criminals, ""for Allah has full power and control over His Affairs, but most of men know not."" (Surah Yusuf 12:21)

20907,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20907,How many years were there between Adam and Muhammad (peace be upon them both)?,How long was the period of time between the creation of Adam (peace be upon him) and the creation of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)?,,,"Praise be to Allah.There is nothing in Islam that defines the period between Adam and Muhammad (peace be upon them both); indeed the length of time that Adam (peace be upon him) lived is not known. 
But there are some ahaadeeth and reports which, if we put them together, we can arriver at an approximate length of time, but that not cover the complete period. Some of these ahaadeeth and reports are saheeh (sound) and others are subject to differences of scholarly opinion, and some periods of time are not defined precisely in any reports. Among the saheeh reports concerning that are the following: 
1 – Allah says concerning the length of time that Nooh (peace be upon him) remained calling his people: 
“and he stayed among them a thousand years less fifty years”
[Al-‘Ankaboot 29:14]
2 – The period between ‘Eesa and our Prophet (peace be upon them both): al-Bukhaari narrated that Salmaan al-Faarisi said: “The period between ‘Eesa and our Prophet (peace be upon them both) was six hundred years.” There are also other reports whose soundness is debatable, which mention the following:  
3 – The period between Adam and Nooh (peace be upon them both): it was narrated from Abu Umaamah that a man said: “O Messenger of Allah, was Adam a Prophet?” He said, “Yes, and Allah spoke to him.” The man asked, “How much (time) was there between him and Nooh?” He said, “Ten centuries.” Narrated by Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh, 14/69; and by al-Haakim, 2/262. He said it is saheeh according to the conditions of Muslim, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Ibn Katheer said in al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah (1/94): this is (saheeh) according to the conditions of Muslim, even though he did not narrate it. 
4 – The period between Nooh and Ibraaheem (peace be upon them both): our evidence is in the continuation of the hadeeth of Abu Umaamah (may Allah be pleased with him) quoted above: … He said, “And how long was there between Nooh and Ibraaheem?” He said, “Ten centuries.” (Narrated by al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak, 2/288. He said: this hadeeth is saheeh according to the conditions of Muslim, although he did not narrate it. And it was narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Mu’jam al-Kabeer, 8/118. 
It was reported that some of the narrators of this hadeeth were da’eef (weak), but al-Albaani classed it as saheeh on the basis of corroborating reports. 
Some of the reports that were narrated include the following: 
5. The period between Moosa and ‘Eesa (peace be upon them both). Al-Qurtubi said: there was some difference of opinion as to the length of this period. Muhammad ibn Sa’d mentioned in his book al-Tabaqaat that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “between Moosa ibn ‘Imraan and ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (peace be upon them both) there were one thousand and seven hundred years, and there was no fatrah (interval when no Prophet was sent) between them, for one thousand Prophets of the Children of Israel were sent between them, apart from other Prophets who were also sent (to other nations). And between the birth of ‘Eesa and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) there were five hundred and ninety-nine years.” (Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 6/121). Ibn Hajar said: “The narrators are agreed that the period of the Jews until the coming of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was more than two thousand years, and the period of the Christians until the coming of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was six hundred years.” (Fath al-Baari, 4/449) 
By looking at the verse, ahaadeeth, reports and opinions quoted above, if they are correct then we may use them to work out the period in question. 
But as for being certain of the length of time between Adam and Muhammad (peace be upon them both), then in addition to the above there are many other considerations to be addressed before we can work it out, including the following: 
·Differences of scholarly opinion concerning the definition of the word qarn (translated above as “century”) – does it mean one hundred years, or does it mean one generation? What we know is that the lifespan of the people at that time was a fraction of the time that Nooh spent in calling his people, and we do not know how long the people of those generations lived.
·There is no report which defines the number of years between Ibraaheem and Moosa (peace be upon them both).
 It remains to be said that being certain about such matters or researching them are not things on which we base our acts of worship or our actions, and the words of Allah are sufficient for us:                                                                                  
“And (also) ‘Aad and Thamood, and the Dwellers of Ar-Rass, and many generations in between”
[Al-Furqaan 25:38 – interpretation of the meaning]
 We must strive to follow the example of these Prophets and walk in their footsteps, because this is the purpose behind mentioning them and their lives:
“They are those whom Allah had guided. So follow their guidance” [Al-An’aam 6:90]

20910,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20910,Her husband is forcing her to wear niqaab and she wants advice,"I wear Hijab but do not wear Niqab, my husband says that if I do not start covering my face then he will divorce me. He says that whatever he asks me to do I should do. I do not want to disobey my husband but to wear niqab would cause me great hardship and sadden me deeply. I guess it is due to lack of eeman that I feel this way but feel that he is trying to force me to do something that I do not want to do. Can you please advise me on this matter.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The evidence of the Qur’aan and Sunnah indicates that it is obligatory for women for cover their faces. This evidence includes the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way)”
[al-Ahzaab 33:59] 
The cloak (jilbaab) is a garment that the woman places over her head and lowers over her face. 
So you have to fear Allaah in this matter and respond to two commands: the command of Allaah and the command of your husband. Undoubtedly this will be very good for you. This matter will make your husband happy and bring happiness to your home. Feelings of difficulty will pass if you are patient and get used to it. These feelings of difficulty will turn to joy when you see the effect that your way of dressing has on him, so you will be responding to Islamic commands and the command of your husband which is in accordance with the laws of Allaah. You will be closing the door to the shaytaans of those who may look at you, and will also be protecting the gaze of chaste and good people from looking at something which they are not permitted to see. And there are other benefits which you will see and appreciate when you respond to this command. 
Sisters who wear niqaab often come to regret the years in which they used to uncover their faces, after Allaah honoured them with the niqaab. If one of them were to be given all the wealth in the world to uncover her face, she would not do it. We have even seen many chaste women who have left their husbands because they wanted them to take off the niqaab. So think about the great difference between your situation and theirs. Where now can we find a man who is keen to keep his family chaste and covered? There are very few of them. Should we disregard these few or should we appreciate their actions which spread good in society? 
We remind you to fear Allaah, and we remind you of the actions of the believing women when they responded to the command of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)”
[al-Noor 24:31]
al-Bukhaari (4481) narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “When this verse was revealed, the muhaajir women took their waist wrappers and tore them at the edges, and covered their faces with them. 
See also the answer to question no. 21134, which explains the obligation of women covering their faces. 
Your husband should also read question no. 20343, which explains the husband’s duty to offer sincere advice to his wife, and ways of doing that.

20916,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20916,Is it permissible for a Muslim woman to ask a Muslim man to marry her?,"Can a Muslim woman ask a Muslim man to marry her? Does the  adeeth also refer to a woman asking a man?

The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: If there comes to you one whose religious commitment and attitude pleases you, then marry [your female relative who is under your care] to him, for if you do not do that, there will be tribulation on earth and much corruption. 

(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 1084).",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    We are happy to congratulate you on choosing the path of the 
    Prophets and of the wise, which is Tawheed, the belief in Allaah alone, and 
    the testimony that Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    is His Messenger. 
With regard to the idea 
    of a Muslim woman offering herself in marriage to a righteous man, that does 
    not contradict the idea of modesty, so long as he is trustworthy with regard 
    to his religious commitment and moral attitude. It was narrated that Thaabit 
    al Banaani said: I was with Anas ibn Maalik and a daughter of his was with 
    him. He said: “A woman came to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and offered herself in marriage to him. She 
    said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, do you want to marry me?’” The daughter of 
    Anas said: “How little was her modesty. How shameless, how shameless!” Anas 
    said: “She was better than you; she had a liking for the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) so she offered herself in marriage to 
    him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4828. 

    Imam al-Bukhaari included this hadeeth in a chapter which he 
    entitled: “A woman offering herself in marriage to a righteous man.” 

    Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said: 

    Ibn al-Munayyir said in al-Haashiyah: One of the 
    subtle points of al-Bukhaari’s knowledge is that he from the specific story 
    of the woman who offered herself in marriage to the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) he derived a general principle; he 
    understood that it is permissible for any woman to offer herself in marriage 
    to a righteous man whose righteousness she admires, and if he likes her he 
    may marry her subject to the conditions of marriage being fulfilled. 
These two ahaadeeth – the 
    hadeeth of Sahl and the hadeeth of Anas, both of which mention the woman who 
    offered herself in marriage to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) – indicate that it is permissible for a woman to offer 
    herself in marriage to a man, and to let him know that she has a liking for 
    him, and there is nothing wrong with her doing so. And the one to whom a 
    woman offers herself in marriage has the choice of either accepting or 
    refusing, but he does not have to express his refusal outright, rather it is 
    sufficient for him to remain silent. 

    Fath al-Baari, 9/175. 

    Al-‘Ayni said: 
The words of Anas to his 
    daughter: “She is better than you” indicate that it is permissible for a 
    woman to offer herself in marriage to a righteous man, and to tell him of 
    her liking for him because of his righteousness and virtue, or because of 
    his knowledge and honour, or for some characteristic of religious 
    commitment, and that there is no shame on her if she does that, rather that 
    is a sign of her virtue. The daughter of Anas (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) looked at the externals and she did not understand this properly until 
    Anas said: “She is better than you.” As for the woman who offers herself in 
    marriage to a man for some worldly purpose, this is something that is 
    abhorrent in the extreme. 

    ‘Umdat al-Qaari’ Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 
    20/113. 

    But it is better for a woman to inform her wali (guardian) of 
    her desire to marry a righteous man who is trustworthy with regard to his 
    religious commitment and his moral attitude, without telling the man 
    bluntly. This may be understood from what one of the two women did, when she 
    said to her father – concerning Moosa (peace be upon him):  
“And said one of them 
    (the two women): ‘O my father! Hire him! Verily, the best of men for you to 
    hire is the strong, the trustworthy’”

    [al-Qasas 28:26 – interpretation of the meaning]

    al-Qurtubi said: 

    With regard to the words of Allaah (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “He said: ‘I intend to wed one of these two daughters of 
    mine to you, on condition that you serve me for eight years…’”

    [al-Qasas 28:27]
Here the father 
    offered his daughter in marriage to the man. This is an established custom 
    whereby the righteous man of Madyan offered his daughter in marriage to a 
    righteous man of the Children of Israel, ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab offered his 
    daughter Hafsah in marriage to Abu Bakr and ‘Uthmaan, and the woman who 
    offered herself in marriage offered herself to the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him). So it is good for a man to offer his 
    female relative who is under his care in marriage, and for a woman to offer 
    herself in marriage to a righteous man, following the example of the 
    righteous salaf. Ibn ‘Umar said: When Hafsah became single (due to her 
    husband dying), ‘Umar said to ‘Uthmaan: “If you wish, I will marry Hafsah 
    bint ‘Umar to you.” This was narrated only by al-Bukhaari, 4005. 

    Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 13/271 

    But it should be noted that most of what happens nowadays, 
    when a woman likes a particular man, is the result of haraam causes, such as 
    a careless attitude on her part whereby she talks to him and sits with him. 
    A person who has evil motives may take advantage of such an offer to achieve 
    some of his aims. So we must beware of this and protect our honour from 
    anything that may besmirch it.

Perhaps Allaah wills that for you by means of this person who is calling you to Islam and by means of your getting in touch with us so that you may be guided to what is best for you in this life and in the Hereafter. 
Islam does not allow any illicit relationship between a man and a woman. Allaah has established marriage as the legitimate means for satisfying sexual desire, and through marriage a man and woman form a family based on the laws of Allaah, and their children are legitimate. 
We will not tell you that hijab (the veil) is not obligatory, and we will not tell you that Islam excuses you from wearing it. Rather we will tell you that you should not let the idea of wearing hijab form an obstacle to your entering Islam. You have to start by saving yourself from your current situation and enter into that which Allaah loves and is pleased with, which is to believe in Him alone (Tawheed) and to bear witness that Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is His Messenger. After you enter Islam and faith becomes established in your heart, you will have the opportunity to study and find out for yourself everything that Allaah likes, so that you can do it, and everything that He hates so you can give it up and avoid it. 
We advise you sincerely from the bottom of our hearts to choose that which is best for you, not so that you can marry a Muslim man, but for your own sake, and for your own happiness and salvation from the punishment and wrath of Allaah. What you are going to choose is nothing other than the religion of the Prophets of old. It is the religion of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses and Jesus. All the Prophets bore witness that God is One, and they denied that He has any partner, wife or son. 
Allaah accepted the Covenant from all the Prophets that they would believe in our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and that they would support him if he was sent during their lifetimes, and He commanded them to tell their nations to do likewise. Allaah made the message of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) a message to all mankind until the Hour begins [i.e., until the Day of Judgement comes], whereas the Prophets before him were each sent only to their own people. 
So do not hesitate. Hasten before your time is up and death comes. Choose the path that leads to happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. May Allaah make you a Muslim woman and a righteous wife who will establish a home and family based on Tawheed (belief in the Oneness of Allaah) and obedience. We ask Allaah to guide you and support you.

please give your valid oppinion.may allah bless you&may your every good wishes come true.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The relationship between a man and his family 
    should not get in the way of his relationship with his wife and children. The smart wife is the one who is keen for her husband to develop a 
    strong relationship with his own family and for there to be friendship and love between them. She should not be an obstacle in the way of the 
    happiness of her husband’s family. 
The smart wife is wise in her dealings if she 
    sees some shortcomings in the way he treats his children and wife, and she is wise if she sees him exaggerating in his concern for his family at 
    the expense of his wife and children. So she makes him aware of his mistake by hinting, not by stating it bluntly, and she advises him without 
    hurting his feelings, and shows him the right way without making him feel that he is wrong, letting him feel that she loves his family and cares 
    for them. 
A woman should not think that her husband’s 
    care for his family will make him fall short in his duties towards her and his children. There is a difference between a husband falling short in 
    his duties towards his wife and children and his loving his family. What makes a man care for his family is his love for them, not his negligence 
    towards his wife and children. 
Secondly: 
Your husband has rights and you have duties. 
    Each of you should do that which is enjoined upon him or her by sharee’ah. Sharee’ah cannot make a man stop loving his family because he has got 
    married, and we cannot ask him to suppress his feelings for the sake of his wife and children. They were his family before he got married and they 
    will remain his family after he gets married. 
You have to try hard to deal with your own 
    feelings, and advise your husband when he falls short in his duties towards you and his children. You do not have the right to denounce him for 
    his love for his sister or his family. There is the fear in such situations that the man will say, “I can find a thousand wives but I cannot find 
    another brother or sister.” So beware of making the matter reach that state. 
At the same time we advise the husband to be 
    pay attention to his wife’s feelings and to take care of his wife and children. We also advise the sister to give her brother similar advice. 
Islam enjoins doing that which is in the 
    interests of all concerned, so that they may share in building the family, not destroying it. All of us must do the duties that Allaah has 
    enjoined upon us, without exaggeration or neglect.

My pregnancy is in early weeks so far.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Islam forbids a woman to get married without a wali (guardian), and it regards a marriage contract done without a wali as invalid. A kaafir cannot be the wali of a Muslim woman, so if none of her family are Muslims, then the leader or mufti of the Muslims, or the imam of the Islamic center, should stand in as her wali. 
Ibn Qudaamah said: A kaafir cannot be the wali of a Muslim woman under any circumstances, according to scholarly consensus.

We have discussed all of the above, with evidence and the comments of the scholars, please see the answers to questions no. 7989 and 2127. 
So the marriage contract is not valid, and it must be annulled and you have to keep away from your husband. The husband has to repeat the marriage contact in the manner prescribed in sharee’ah, if he wants to be married to you. Try to get some good and righteous people to intervene and convince him to do that, and to correct his mistake, as this is in your interests and the interests of your child. If he does not respond, then our advice is to forget about him, because his words are not the words of a trustworthy man. His saying that he is “not ready for marriage” indicates that he only wanted to have intercourse with you, and he did not want to adhere to the commands and laws of Allaah, and the commands to be the protector and maintainer of his wife.

It is not permissible for him to tell you to have an abortion, and it is not permissible for you to have an abortion if the foetus has reached the stage where the soul has been breathed into it. If you do that you will be killing a soul. 
See also questions no 12118 and 13319 and 4038. 
With regard to the child, it is valid to call him after his father and he is not regarded as an illegitimate child, rather the scholars regard him as the child of a marriage contract with some faults in it, and the child born of such a marriage is to be attributed to his father. See al-Mughni, 11/196 
Remember that Allaah has guaranteed provision for His slaves, and has promised that whoever fears Allaah, He will give him a way out. 
So fear Allaah, put your trust in Him and repent to him… Part of repenting means separating from this man, because the marriage contract is invalid, for there is no marriage without a wali, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said. And when you do that you will be doing it only because it is the command of Allaah.  
Know that whoever gives up something for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will compensate him or her with something better… May Allaah give you strength and make things easy for you.

If Wudu will harm your skin or delay your recovery, then you should do Tayammum, and there is no sin on you.",,"Praise be to Allah.Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.” [Al-Baqarah 2:286]
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “… if I forbid you from doing  something, avoid it, and if I command you to do something, do as much as you can.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 6858; Muslim, 1337) 
Although Allah has clearly commanded us to do Wudu with water, He exempted the sick from having to do Wudu with water and has allowed them to do Tayammum . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Approach not As-Salah (the prayer) when you are in a drunken state until you know (the meaning) of what you utter, nor when you are in a state of Janabah (i.e. in a state of sexual impurity and have not yet taken a bath), except when travelling on the road (without enough water, or just passing through a mosque), till you wash your whole body. And if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have been in contact with women (by sexual relations) and you find no water, do Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands (Tayammum). Truly, Allah is Ever Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.” [Al-Nisa’ 4:43]
Shaykh Muhammad Al-Salih Al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Or if he is afraid of using it or if looking for it will cause him physical harm: 
If he will be physically harmed by using water and will become sick, then this comes under the general meaning of the words (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But if you are ill or on a journey.” [Al-Maidah 5:6]
For example, if there are wounds or sores on the parts of the body that are washed during Wudu, or if there are wounds or sores on all parts of the body, in the case of Ghusl (ritual bath), and there is the fear of physical harm, then he may do Tayammum.” (Al-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 1/378, 379; Ibn Al-Jawzi edition) 
But if he can put water on his skin without affecting it, then he should do so, and he does not have to rub that part of the body or go to extremes in washing it. 
Shaykh Muhammad Al-Salih Al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Similarly he does not have to go to extremes in rinsing his nose if he has a problem in the sinuses, because in that case the water may settle there and cause an unpleasant smell and make him sick, or it may cause him some harm. It should be said to such a person: it is sufficient for you to rinse your nose until the water enters the nostrils.” (Al-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 1/210, Ibn Al-Jawzi edition) 
He also said: 
“If a person has a sinus problem, or if going to extremes in rinsing the nose will make the water reach the sinuses and cause him pain, or if the water will turn rotten and turn to pus and so on, in this case we say to him: Do not go to extremes in rinsing your nose, so as to ward off harm from yourself.” (Al-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 1/172.

An analogy has been made for similar purposes or those which are more essential, such as protecting houses from burglars, using them to find drugs and thieves. In any other cases, the one who keeps a dog is subject to the warning of having one or two qiraats deducted from his reward every day. 
Shaykh Yoosuf ibn ‘Abd al-Haadi said, quoting from some of the scholars:  
Undoubtedly the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave permission to keep hunting dogs in several ahaadeeth, and said that keeping a dog for hunting does not detract from one’s reward. In another hadeeth he gave permission to keep a dog for herding livestock, and in another hadeeth for keeping sheep, and in another hadeeth for guarding farms. So it is known that the reason which makes it permissible to keep a dog is when it is for a purpose, and the ruling depends on whether that reason is there or not. If the reason is there, then it is permissible to keep a dog, even though some reasons are more important than agricultural reasons, and some reasons are equally important to those that are mentioned in the texts. Undoubtedly crops come under the same ruling as farms, and cattle come under the same ruling as sheep; guarding chickens and geese – to keep foxes away from them – comes under the same heading as guarding sheep. Undoubtedly the fear of burglars and keeping a dog to warn of them and wake one up is a more important reason; the Lawgiver pays attention to interests and wards off harms; if there is no reason for it then it is wrong. End quote. 
Al-Ighraab fi Ahkaam al-Kilaab (p. 106-107). 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
Based on that, a house that is in the middle of the city has no need for a dog to guard it, so keeping a dog for this purpose in such a case is haraam and it is not permissible, and it detracts one or two qiraats from the reward of its owners every day. They should get rid of this dog and not keep it. But if a house is in the countryside and there is no one else around, then it is permissible to keep a dog to guard the house and its occupants; guarding the members of the household is more important than guarding livestock and crops.""(Majmoo’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen  4/246). 
Secondly: 
Islam does not enjoin anything but that which is good for people, and it does not forbid them anything but that which is harmful to them. But this wisdom is known to those who know it and it is unknown to those who do not know it. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined washing vessels that have been licked by a dog, and that is only because its saliva is impure. Modern science has proven that there are several harmful things in water from which a dog has drunk. The Muslim who follows the command of sharee’ah has no choice but to obey the command, and refrain from that which is forbidden, even if he does not know the reason behind it and there is nothing wrong with trying to find out the reason behind it, but he should not make his compliance dependent upon knowing the reason. 
Some of these diseases are transmitted because of going against the command of Islam, and eating and drinking from vessels used by dogs, and some of them are transmitted because the dog carries germs that cause these diseases. 
Whatever the case, the Muslim hears and obeys, and goodness is found in responding to sharee’ah by doing what is commanded and avoiding what is forbidden.

Taking a girlfriend does not only destroy the family, it destroys society, and those who do this are threatened with the punishment and wrath of Allaah. Love is a sickness that destroys the heart and leads to evil and immorality. The Shaytaan will keep tempting them and pushing them until they commit immoral actions and thus each gets what he or she wants from the other. 
There are many forbidden matters associated with this, such as transgressing against the honour of others, betraying trust, being alone with a member of the opposite sex, touching, kissing, speaking immoral words, then the greater evil which occurs at the end, which is the sin of zina. 
The fact that the questioner says “no one knows about us” is strange. How can he forget about his Lord Who knows what is secret and what is yet more hidden, and who knows the fraud of the eyes and all that the hearts conceal. (cf. Ghaafir 40:19). 
Our advice to you, as you are still young, is to discipline yourself to obey Allaah and always remember that He is watching; fear Allaah concerning people’s honour; strive for the Day when you will meet your Lord with your deeds; remember the scandal that may happen in this world and the Hereafter. Remember that you have sisters and will have a wife and daughters, so would you like for one of them what you are doing with the daughters of the Muslims? The answer is that you would certainly not like it, and other people do not like it either. Remember that you may see the results of your sin in some of your family members as a punishment to you from your Lord. 
You have to look for righteous friends, and you have to keep yourself busy doing that which Allaah loves and is pleased with. Pay attention to the best and most sublime things and leave alone the worst and most vile things. Make the most of your youth in obeying and worshipping Allaah, seeking knowledge and calling others to Allaah. Remember that there were those of your age and younger who were men who had memorized the Qur’aan, who sought knowledge, whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent to call others to Allaah and to enter the religion of Islam. 
We advise you to get married to a righteous, religiously-committed woman who will help you adhere to your religion and encourage you to adhere to the laws of Allaah, who will look after your children and bring them up with good morals and religious commitment. Give up this woman who agrees to go out with a man who is a stranger to her (a non-mahram) and meet him and talk to him; if she agrees to do immoral actions now then what is going to prevent her from continuing to do so in the  future? 
Remember that you are angering your Lord with such sins as being alone with her, meeting her and talking to her, and anything more than that is even more serious. 
You should realize that zina does not only involve the private parts, rather the eyes may commit zina, the ears may commit zina, the hand may commit zina and the foot may commit zina, as was proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). All of that leads to the zina of the private parts. So do not let the Shaytaan deceive you, for he is an enemy to you who wishes you evil and tells you to commit immoral actions. 
Shaykh Muhammad al-Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen said: 
Contact between lovers in improper and unlawful ways is a calamity and a real disaster. It is not permissible for the man to contact the woman in this case, or for the woman to contact the man. If he says that he wants to marry her, then he must tell her wali (guardian) that he wants to marry her, or she should tell her wali that she wants to marry him, as ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) did when he offered his daughter Hafsah in marriage to Abu Bakr and ‘Uthmaan (may Allaah be pleased with them). 
But if the woman contacts the man directly, this is the source of fitnah (temptation). 
As’ilat al-Baab il-Maftooh (Question no. 868). 
Secondly: 
With regard to your question about such forbidden relationships in the ancient love stories, the fact that such stories existed among those who came before us cannot be taken as proof with regard to shar’i rulings, because the rulings of sharee’ah having to do with what is forbidden and what is allowed are to be taken from the shar’i evidence of the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and the commands and prohibitions contained therein. 
Some of those mentioned in these stories came before Islam, such as ‘Antarah and others, and such stories are to be found in other cultures as is well known. But we cannot take shar’i rulings from this because Islam came to bring people forth from being controlled by their desires to complete submission to Allaah the Lord of the Worlds.

    invitation of a Jew. Narrated by Ahmad, 3/210. 
It is well known that most of the Jews deal in 
    riba (usury) and consume haraam wealth. This view may be supported by the fact that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)

How to protect yourself from the evil eye


Does taking precautions against the evil eye contradict tawakkul?","Praise be to Allah.What is the evil eye?
Here follows some information and fatwas (rulings) that have to do with the evil eye. We ask Allah to benefit readers thereby. 
The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: 
What is the definition of the evil eye? Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And from the evil of the envier when he envies.” [Al-Falaq 113:5] 
Is the hadith (narration) of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sahih (authentic) in which it says that “One third of those who are in the grave are there because of the evil eye”? If a person thinks that someone is envying him , what should the Muslim do and say? If the person who put the evil eye on someone washes himself, will the water he used bring healing to his victim? And should he drink the water or wash himself with it? 
They replied: 
The Arabic word al-‘ayn (translated as the evil eye) refers to when a person harms another with his eye. It starts when the person likes a thing, then his evil feelings affect it, by means of his repeated looking at the object of his jealousy. Allah commanded His Prophet, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), to seek refuge with Him from the envier, as He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And from the evil of the envier when he envies.” [Al-Falaq 113:5] 
Everyone who puts the evil eye on another is envious, but not every envier puts the evil eye on another. The word hasid (envier) is more general in meaning than the word ‘aain (one who puts the evil eye on another), so seeking refuge with Allah from the one who envies includes seeking refuge with Him from the one who puts the evil eye on another. The evil eye is like an arrow which comes from the soul of the one who envies and the one who puts the evil eye on another towards the one who is envied and on whom the evil eye is put; sometimes it hits him and sometimes it misses. If the target is exposed and unprotected, it may affect him, but if the target is cautious and armed, the arrow will have no effect and may even come back on the one who launched it. Adapted from Zad al-Ma'ad. 
There are ahadith (reports) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which speak of the effects of the evil eye. For example it is narrated in al-Sahihayn that ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to tell me to recite ruqyah (incantation) for protection against the evil eye.  
Muslim, Ahmad and al-Tirmidhi narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The evil eye is real and if anything were to overtake the divine decree, it would be the evil eye. When you are asked to take a bath (to provide a cure) from the influence of the evil eye, you should take a bath.”
Imam Ahmad and al-Tirmidhi narrated that Asma bint ‘Umays said: “O Messenger of Allah, the children of J’afar have been afflicted by the evil eye, shall we recite ruqyah for them?” He said, “Yes, for if anything were to overtake the divine decree it would be the evil eye.”
Abu Dawud narrated that ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The person who had put the evil eye on another would be ordered to do wudu, then the person who had been afflicted would wash himself (with that water).
Imam Ahmad, Malik, al-Nasai and Ibn Hibban narrated from Sahl ibn Hanif that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came out and traveled with him towards Makkah, until they were in the mountain pass of al-Kharar in al-Jahfah. There Sahl ibn Hanif did ghusl (bathed), and he was a handsome white-skinned man with beautiful skin. ‘Amir ibn Rabi'ah, one of Banu ‘Adiyy ibn Ka'b looked at him whilst he was doing ghusl and said: “I have never seen such beautiful skin as this, not even the skin of a virgin,” and Sahl fell to the ground. They went to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of Allah, can you do anything for Sahl, because by Allah he cannot raise his head.” He said, “Do you accuse anyone with regard to him?” They said, “‘Amir ibn Rabi'ah looked at him.” So the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called ‘Amir and rebuked him strongly. He said, “Why would one of you kill his brother? If you see something that you like, then pray for blessing for him.” Then he said to him, “Wash yourself for him.” So he washed his face, hands, forearms, knees and the sides of his feet, and inside his izar (lower garment) in the vessel. Then that water was poured over him, and a man poured it over his head and back from behind. He did that to him, then Sahl got up and joined the people and there was nothing wrong with him.  Classed as sahih (authentic) by al-Albani in al-Mishkat.
The majority of scholars are of the view that people can indeed be afflicted by the evil eye , because of the ahadith (reports) quoted above and others, and because of the corroborating reports and other evidence. 
With regard to the hadith that you mention, “One third of those who are in the grave are there because of the evil eye,” we do not know how sound it is, but the author of Nayl al-Awtar said that al-Bazzar narrated with a hasan isnad (sound chain of narrators) from Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Most of those who die among my ummah (followers) die because of the will and decree of Allah, and then because of the evil eye.” 
The Muslim has to protect himself against the devils among the evil jinn and mankind, by having strong faith in Allah and by putting his trust in Him and seeking refuge with Him and beseeching Him, reciting the prayers for protection narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), reciting al-Mu’awwadhatayn [the last two surahs of the Quran], Surat al-Ikhlas, Surat al-Fatihah, and ayat al-Kursi. 
Du`a  for protection from evil eye
Du’as for protection include the following: 
A’udhu bi kalimat-illah il-tammati min sharri ma khalaq (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from the evil of that which He has created). 
A’udhu bi kalimat-illah il-tammati min ghadabihi wa ‘iqabihi, wa min sharri ‘ibadihi wa min hamazat al-shayatini wa an yahduroon (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from His wrath and punishment, from the evil of His slaves and from the evil promptings of the devils and from their presence). 
And one may recite the words of Allah: 
“Hasbi Allahu la ilaha illa huwa, ‘alayhi tawakkaltu wa huwa Rabbul-'arsh il-‘azim
 
(Allah is sufficient for me. La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He) in Him I put my trust and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne).”
[9:129 – interpretation of the meaning] 
And there are other similar du’as that are prescribed in shari’ah (Islamic law). This is what was meant by Ibn al-Qayyim in the words quoted at the beginning of this answer. 
If it is known or suspected that a person has been afflicted by the evil eye , then the one who put the evil eye on him should be ordered to wash himself for his brother. So a vessel of water should be brought, and he should put his hand in it and rinse out his mouth into the vessel. Then he should wash his face in the vessel, then put his left hand into the vessel and wash his right knee, then put his right hand in the vessel and wash his left knee. Then he should wash inside his garment. Then the water should be poured over the head of the one on whom he put the evil eye, pouring it from behind in one go. Then he will be healed, by Allah’s leave.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah li’l-Buhuth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Ifta)
Can the evil eye afflict a person? 
Shaykh Muhammad al-Salih al-‘Uthaymin was asked: 
Can the evil eye afflict a person? How is it treated? Does being on one's guard against it contradict putting one's trust in Allah? 
He replied: 
Our opinion concerning the evil eye is that it is real and is proven both by Islamic teachings and by real life experiences. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And verily, those who disbelieve would almost make you slip with their eyes (through hatred).” [Al-Qalam 68:51] 
Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) and others said, commenting on this verse: this means, they put the evil eye on you with their glances. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The evil eye is real and if anything were to overtake the divine decree, it would be the evil eye. When you are asked to take a bath (to provide a cure) from the influence of the evil eye, you should take a bath.” (Muslim). Al-Nasai and Ibn Majah narrated that ‘Amir ibn Rabi'ah passed by Sahl ibn Hanif when he was bathing … and he quoted the hadith. 
Reality confirms this and it cannot be denied. 
How to protect yourself from the evil eye
In the event that you are afflicted by the evil eye, you should use the treatments recommended in the Shari’ah, which are: 
1 – Reciting ruqyah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “There is no ruqyah except in the case of the evil eye or fever.” al-Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud. Jibril (peace be upon him) used to do ruqyah for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and say, “Bismillahi arqika min kulli shayin yudheeka, min sharri kulli nafsin aw ‘aynin hasid Allahu yashfeek, bismillahi arqeek (In the name of Allah I perform ruqyah for you, from everything that is harming you, from the evil of every soul or envious eye may Allah heal you, in the name of Allah I perform ruqyah for you).” 
2 – Asking the person who has put the evil eye on another to wash, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded ‘Amir ibn Rabi'ah to do in the hadith quoted above. Then the water should be poured over the one who has been afflicted.  
With regard to taking his waste, such as his urine and stool, there is no basis for doing so; the same applies to taking any of his belongings. Rather what is narrated is that which is mentioned above, washing his limbs and washing inside his garment, or likewise washing inside his headgear and garments. And Allah knows best. 
Does taking precautions against the evil eye contradict tawakkul?
There is nothing wrong with taking precautions against the evil eye before it happens, and this does not contradict the idea of tawakkul (putting one's trust in Allah). In fact this is tawakkul, because tawakkul means putting one’s trust in Allah whilst also implementing the means that have been permitted or enjoined. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to seek refuge for al-Hasan and al-Husayn and say: U’idhukuma bi kalimat Allah al-tammati min kulli shaytanin wa hammah wa min kulli ‘aynin lammah (I seek refuge for you both in the perfect words of Allah, from every devil and every poisonous reptile, and from every evil eye).’”  Al-Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud. And he would say, “Thus Ibrahim used to seek refuge with Allah for Ishaq and Ismail, peace be upon them both.” [al-Bukhari]. (Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin)

20958,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20958,Preventing Breaking Wind to Avoid Invalidating Wudu,Is it prohibited to try to prevent wind from coming out during prayer or in order to stay in Wudu before prayer?,"Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “Do not pray when food is ready or when you are trying to stop yourself from doing either of the two things that invalidate Wudu (i.e., urination and defecation).” So, everything that may distract a person, keep him from being properly focused in his prayer, or worry him, should be dealt with before he starts to pray.",,"Praise be to Allah.`Aishah said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “One should not pray when food is ready or when one is trying to stop oneself from doing either of the two things that break Wudu (i.e., urination and defecation).” (Narrated by Muslim, 560) 
Shaykh Muhammad Al-Salih Al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
If dinner is ready and a person wants to eat, should he start with the meal even if the time for prayer is going to end? 
He replied: 
“This is an area where the scholars differed. Some of them said that the prayer should be delayed if his mind is going to be distracted by thinking about the food and drink, etc., that are waiting, even if the time for prayer ends. 
But the majority of scholars said that the presence of food that is ready is not an excuse for delaying the prayer, rather that applies when food is ready and the prayer is about to be offered in congregation, i.e., a man is excused from praying in congregation when there is food ready that he wants to eat. So he should eat and then go to the mosque, and if he catches up with the congregation that is fine , otherwise there is no blame on him.  
But this should not become a habit whereby his food is only prepared at the time of prayer, because this means that he is determined not to pray in congregation. However, if this happens coincidentally, then he is excused for not praying in congregation, and he may eat until he is full, because if he eats only one or two mouthfuls he may crave even more for the food. 
This is different from the situation of a man who is starving, when he finds prohibited food such as dead meat. Should we say that if you cannot find anything but dead meat and you fear that you may die or suffer harm, then eat from the dead meat until you are full, or should we say to eat only as much as is necessary? We tell him, eat only as much as is necessary, and if two mouthfuls are enough then do not eat a third. 
Can this ruling on dinner be applied to other things that disturb a person such as needing to urinate, defecate or pass wind ? 
The answer is, yes, this ruling applies in these cases. In the book of Muslim, it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not pray when food is ready or when you are trying to stop yourself from doing either of the two things that break Wudu (i.e., urination and defecation)”
- meaning urination or defecation, and breaking wind is akin to these two.
The basic principle is that everything that may distract a person, keep him from being properly focused in his prayer, or worry him, should be dealt with before he starts to pray.  
This may be summed up by saying: The essence and spirit of prayer is the proper focus of the heart and mind, hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us to get rid of everything that may prevent that before a person starts to pray.” (Fatawa Al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 13. question no, 588) 
The Shaykh was also asked: 
If a person needs to urinate but he fears that he will miss the prayer in congregation if he relieves himself, should he pray whilst he is holding it in, so as to be sure of praying with the congregation, or should he relieve himself even if that means missing the congregational prayer? 
He replied: 
“He should relieve himself and do Wudu, even if he misses the prayer in congregation, because this is a valid excuse. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not pray when food is ready or when you are trying to stop yourself from doing either of the two things that break Wudu (i.e., urination and defecation).” (Fatawa Al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 13, question, 589)

I am forced to be on business trips or functions with people from my work who sometimes drink alcohol. am I doing sin by being with them when I am not drinking or doing anything against my beleives.If I don't participate in those functions, maybe I will jeopardize my Job.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah has favoured this ummah over other 
    nations in many matters, chief among which is enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“You (true believers in Islamic 
    Monotheism, and real followers of Prophet Muhammad and his Sunnah) are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind; you enjoin Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. 
    Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained) and forbid Al‑Munkar (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden), and you believe 
    in Allaah”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:110]
What you have to do – as you are the only 
    Muslim in your company, as you say – is to be proud of the teachings [?] of your religion, and strive to apply them, and not to do anything that 
    you are forbidden to do. This is something that will raise you in status and increase your reward. Staying with them even though you are not 
    drinking alcohol yourself is still a sin in itself, because Allaah has commanded us not to sit in places where evil is committed, otherwise what 
    befalls those who are committing the evil action will also befall us. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And it has already been revealed to you 
    in the Book (this Qur’aan) that when you hear the Verses of Allaah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until they engage in a talk 
    other than that; (but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them”
[al-Nisa’ 4:140] 
“And when you (Muhammad) see those who 
    engage in a false conversation about Our Verses (of the Qur’aan) by mocking at them, stay away from them till they turn to another topic. And if 
    Shaytaan (Satan) causes you to forget, then after the remembrance sit not you in the company of those people who are the Zaalimoon (polytheists 
    and wrongdoers)”
[al-An’aam 6:68]
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever among you sees an 
    evil action, let him change it with his hand (by taking action); if he cannot, then with his tongue (by speaking out); if he cannot, then with his 
    heart (by hating it and feeling that it is wrong), and that is the weakest of faith.” Narrated by Muslim, 70. 
This denunciation of the heart refers to the 
    stress and agitation that one feels in the presence of evil. This is an individual obligation upon all people in all situations, and they have no 
    excuse for not doing this, because no one has any power over the heart. Staying in a place where evil is being committed goes against this 
    required denunciation. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him) said: 
The believer has to fear Allaah with regard 
    to His slaves, but their guidance is not his responsibility. This is what is meant by the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“O you who believe! Take care of your 
    ownselves. If you follow the (right) guidance [and enjoin what is right (Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and forbid what 
    is wrong (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden)] no hurt can come to you from those who are in error”
[al-Maa’idah 5:105]
Following right guidance means doing all the obligatory duties. If a Muslim does his duty of 
    enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, as well as other duties, the misguidance of those who are misguided will never harm him. This 
    may be done sometimes with the heart, sometimes with the tongue, and sometimes with the hand. Denunciation with the heart is obligatory in every 
    situation, because no harm can result from it, and whoever does not do that is not a Muslim, as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “And that is the weakest of faith.” 
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 
    28/127 
Moreover the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade sitting at a table where wine is being drunk. 
It was narrated that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab 
    (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever believes in Allaah and the Last 
    Day, let him not sit at a table where wine is being drunk.” 
Narrated by Ahmad, 126; classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 7/6. 
See also the answer to question no. 8957; 
    6992. 
Finally we remind you of the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his 
    duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).
 And He will provide him from (sources) he 
    never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allaah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allaah has set a measure for all things”
[al-Talaaq 65:2-3] 
So give up these evil things, and those trips and sitting with those people. Seek the reward for that with your Lord. If this leads to your leaving your job, then you will have a great reward with Allaah and you will find goodness, a way out and provision by His Leave. 
And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
20960,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20960,No Place for Ablution or Prayer at Work,"I work for an American company, and I am the only Muslim. There is no clean place or feasible place to perform wudu (ablution) during the day, and there is no private place to perform salah (formal prayer). Is it haram (impermissible) to wait until I get home to perform Dhur and ‘Asr salah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The 
    Muslim has to understand the importance of prayer and the necessity of 
    observing prayer regularly at the appointed times, fulfilling all the 
    conditions and pillars and essential parts of the prayer. Allah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    
    “Verily, As-Salah (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours.”

    
    [al-Nisa 4:103] 

    It was 
    narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I 
    asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Which deed is 
    most beloved to Allah?” He said, “Prayer performed on time.” He said, “Then 
    what?” He said, “Honouring one’s parents.” He said, “Then what?” He said, 
    “Jihad (fighting) for the sake of Allah.” 

    
    Narrated by al-Bukhari (504) and Muslim (85).

    So it 
    is not permissible for the Muslim to delay his prayer beyond the time it is 
    due. Wudoo does not require a clean place. Even if we assume that it does, 
    the questioner could make sure that he has wudoo before coming to work and 
    keep his wudoo so that he can pray on time.

    He has 
    to offer prayer on time. Looking for a clean place where he can perform the 
    prayer is not too difficult. Prayer is valid in any place on earth so long 
    as it is clean and pure. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “The earth has been made for me a place of prayer and 
    purification, so whenever the time of prayer comes for any man of my ummah, 
    let him pray.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 335; Muslim, 521. Sharee’ah (Islamic 
    law) only excludes from this specific places in which prayer is not valid, 
    which include graveyards and bathrooms. The Prophet (peace and blessings of 
    Allah be upon him) said: “All the earth is a place of prostration apart from 
    graveyards and bathrooms.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 492; classed as saheeh 
    (authentic) by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 

    So the 
    workplace may be a place of prayer if it is clean. If it is not easy then he 
    should look for somewhere else. Asking his bosses to allocate a corner where 
    he can pray is not something that is difficult. 

    Shaykh 
    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:

    If he 
    deliberately delays the prayer until the time is too short to meet all the 
    conditions and do all the essential parts of the prayer, such as if there is 
    some impure substance on him, or he is junub and delays the prayer so that 
    if he does ghusl the time for prayer will be over, then he has to purify 
    himself first, but he is a sinner because he is doing the prayer at the 
    wrong time. He should have purified himself before the time became too short 
    and prayed on time. When he delays it, then he has to do what is required in 
    the right sequence even though he is a sinner because of his delaying it.

    Sharh 
    al-‘Umdah, 
    4/58.

    If he 
    is unable to fulfil one of the conditions of prayer being valid – such as 
    taharah (purity) – then he should pray on time and he is exempted from this 
    condition. It is not permissible to delay the prayer until its time is over 
    in order to fulfil that condition.

    Shaykh 
    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:

    
    Because those who are obliged to pray when the time for prayer comes, but 
    are unable to fulfil one of its conditions or essential parts at that 
    moment, but will be able to do so after the time for prayer is over, it is 
    not permissible for them to delay the prayer until its time is over. If this 
    were permissible then the one who is unable to purify himself, cover 
    himself, bow or prostrate, or do any other condition or essential part of 
    the prayer would be allowed to delay the prayer until he is able to do this, 
    if he knows or thinks it most likely that he will be able to do it. This is 
    contrary to the Quran, Sunnah and scholarly consensus, because sharee’ah’s 
    concern that the prayer be performed on time is greater than its concern for 
    any other condition or essential part of prayer that cannot be done. Hence 
    it is not permissible to delay the prayer until its time is over because of 
    being unable to do some of the essential parts. When the time for the 
    obligatory prayer is too short and one cannot fulfil the conditions, then 
    doing the prayer on time takes precedence over the conditions. There is only 
    one time when fulfilling the conditions takes precedence over the act 
    itself, which is when the act becomes obligatory towards the end of its 
    time, such as when a sleeper wakes up at the end of the time, in which case 
    the prayer becomes obligatory when he wakes up, and he must fulfil the 
    conditions of prayer. This applies if someone wakes up after the time for 
    prayer is over.

    one who is preventing you from making a firm decision to enter Islam; he is the one who is making you think that your entering Islam is not 
    because of your own conviction and that you will never have peace of mind, and other thoughts that he is putting into your heart and mind, and 
    making you hesitate to make the decision that will bring you happiness in this world and in the Hereafter.
Your becoming Muslim will be for the sake of 
    Allaah, and the Muslim man is only the means that led to that. There is no shame on a man who becomes Muslim because of a woman who advises him 
    sincerely and guides him, and there is no shame on a woman who becomes Muslim because of a man who advises her sincerely and guides her. There 
    follows the unique story of a woman in Islam. She is one of the rare examples of this ummah (nation); think long and hard about her story: 
It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: 
    Abu Talhah proposed marriage to Umm Sulaym, and she said: “By Allaah, O Abu Talhah, a man like you is not to be refused, but you are a kaafir man, 
    and I am a Muslim woman, and it is not permissible for me to marry you. But if you become Muslim that will be my mahr (dowry), and I will not ask 
    you for anything else.” So he became Muslim, and that was her mahr. 
Thaabit – the student of Anas – said: I never 
    heard of any woman who had a better mahr than Umm Sulaym, which was Islam [i.e., her husband becoming Muslim]. Then he consummated the marriage 
    with her, and she bore him a child. 
Narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 3341. Classed as 
    saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i. 
You should also note that as soon as faith enters the depths of your heart, you will realize 
    that the whole world cannot be equal to living for one moment with this great blessing of Islam. Some people entered Islam for the sake of money, 
    but they soon began to love Islam and to fight for its sake, sacrificing that which was most dear to them. 
So you must strive within yourself and 
    realize that the Shaytaan wants to prevent you from attaining happiness and following the religion of man's natural inclination and reason.  You 
    will be choosing the religion of Adam, Ibraaheem (Abraham), Moosa (Moses) and the Messiah (peace be upon them all), the religion of the natural 
    inclination of man with which people were created. This universe has only one Lord, with no partner or associate. He is the One Who deserves to be 
    worshipped alone, and our Prophet Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was only sent with the same message as the Messengers 
    who came before him. So be with those who follow the Prophets and Messengers and you will find happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. 
Secondly: 
Islam will never prevent you from meeting 
    with your family, rather it will urge you to treat them even better than you did before, so that you will be a good example of a Muslim woman, and 
    help them to embrace this religion. The people who most deserve to share this blessing with you are your family members. 
Asma’ bint Abi Bakr al-Siddeeq said: My 
    mother came to me when she was a mushrik at the time of Quraysh, at the time of the treaty with them (i.e. during the period when the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had made a peace treaty with the people of Makkah not to fight for the duration). I asked 
    the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “O Messenger of Allaah, my mother has come and she needs my help, should 
    I uphold ties of kinship with my mother?” He said, “Yes, uphold the ties of kinship with your mother.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari (and Muslim, 1003). 
Here the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) gave permission for a Muslim to uphold the ties of kinship with his family who follow a religion other than Islam, even if 
    those family members are calling him to forsake his religion and become a mushrik (one who worships others besides Allaah). Although Islam forbids 
    him to respond to their call, it still commands him to treat them well and be kind to them. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in 
    weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years  
    give thanks to Me and to your parents. Unto Me is the final destination.
But if they (both) strive with you to make 
    you join in worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not; but behave with them in the world kindly”
[Luqmaan 31:14-15]
Our Prophet Muhammad  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) was keen to call his family to Islam, and he continued to visit them and call them; he visited his paternal uncle 
    Abu Taalib when he was dying and invited him to Islam. 
So there is nothing to prevent you visiting 
    your family, but that should be in agreement with your husband, and you have to utilize these visits to call them to the truth and goodness, and 
    help them to attain salvation. 
What is haraam in these visits is free mixing 
    of men and women, shaking hands with non-mahram men, and joining in their festivals. It is no secret to you that the rulings brought by Islam are 
    in the best interests of people, both in this world and in the Hereafter. There is nothing wrong with exchanging gifts with them either, and that 
    may be a means of softening their hearts and encouraging them to become Muslim, so long as the gifts are not given because of their festivals, 
    especially the religious festivals. It is not permissible for you to accept or give gifts on those occasions, because that is helping them in 
    their falsehood and approving of it.

20962,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20962,Ruling on playing pool billiards and the loser paying for the table rental,"We play pool billiards sometimes for fun, and play loser pays, meaning whomever loses has to pay the fee for the table rental?  Is this halal?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Anyone who looks at the state of youth today 
    will see that most of them are not serious and have no interest in acquiring beneficial knowledge or seeking halaal provision. They waste their 
    time with things that are not useful, which causes psychological and physical problems. 
One of the salaf passed by some people who 
    were playing and said: “I wish that time could be bought with money, then I would buy these people’s time!” 
Yes, for those great men, the hours of the 
    day were not enough for research, study and serious work; they used to sleep and eat less so that they would not be wasting time. 
Now we see the youth, unfortunately, wasting 
    the best years of their life with play and leisure. We do not want our young brothers to regard as forbidden the kinds of leisure and play that 
    Allaah has permitted them, but we wish that this would not be the thing with which they are preoccupied night and day, and that they would look 
    for a game that will benefit them mentally and physically and help them develop their skills. 
Secondly: 
Playing pool billiards in clubs is not 
    permissible, not because the game itself is haraam, rather because these clubs involve many haraam things such as swearing, neglecting prayer and 
    gambling, and playing in them involves keeping quiet about evil with no need to stay in these places. 
As for playing this game in places where no 
    evil things are present, there is nothing wrong with that, but that is subject to conditions, for example: 
1.There should be no betting.
2.There should be no swearing, name-calling, mockery or hatred.
3.It should not lead to missing obligatory duties such as prayer, seeking knowledge, and looking after 
    one’s family, teaching them and disciplining them.
We have mentioned above that most of the 
    fuqaha’, including Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, regarded chess as haraam, and that those who allowed it did so only if these conditions are met. 
    When we think about youth and the way they play, we will see that these conditions are hardly ever met. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said concerning 
    chess – and his words may be applied to pool billiards and other games that young people play today –: 
… What is meant is that when chess distracts people from their duties, whether inwardly or 
    outwardly, then it is haraam according to scholarly consensus. The fact that it distracts people from fulfilling their duties properly is so 
    obvious as to need no explanation. The same applies if it distracts people from duties other than prayer, such as taking care of oneself or one’s 
    family, or enjoining that which is good and forbidding that which is evil, or upholding the ties of kinship, or honouring one’s parents, or 
    fulfilling one’s duties with regard to public office, etc.  
It rarely happens that a person involves 
    himself with these games and they do not distract him from some duty. It should be noted that there is scholarly consensus on the prohibition in 
    such cases. Similarly if the game involves something that is haraam or leads to something haraam, then it is haraam according to scholarly 
    consensus, such as if it involves lying, false oaths, cheating, or wrongdoing or helping in wrongdoing. That is haraam according to the consensus 
    of the Muslims, even if it is in a race or contest, so how about if it is chess or dice and the like? 
The same applies if it involves some other kind of evil, such as getting involved in something 
    that may lead to immorality, or cooperating in aggression etc, or if the game attracts too many people which leads to neglecting an obligatory 
    duty or doing something haraam. This kind of game and others like it are things that the Muslims are agreed are haraam. 
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 
    32/218 
Secondly: 
With regard to the loser being the one who 
    has to pay the table rent, this is a kind of gambling, which is haraam because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds 
    of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al-Ansaab, and Al-Azlaam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytaan’s (Satan’s) 
    handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.
Shaytaan (Satan) wants only to excite 
    enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants (alcoholic drinks) and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allaah and from As-Salaah 
    (the prayer). So, will you not then abstain?”
[al-Maa’idah 5:90-91]
The basic principle is that the rental of 
    this game – if it is free of haraam elements – should be paid by all the players. But the players agree that the loser will pay for himself and 
    others, and the winners will not have to pay anything, this is what is called sabaq (prize money, winnings) and it is like betting on the 
    game. This is not permissible according to sharee’ah, except where that has been narrated in a text in cases having to do with developing skills 
    that are useful for jihad, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no sabaq except in archery, 
    horse-racing and camel-racing.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1700; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
That applies only to archery competitions and 
    horse and camel racing, and the scholars drew analogies to other skills that are useful in jihad. Some also allowed competitions having to do with 
    Islamic knowledge, because that is supporting Islam, like jihad with the sword, if not more so. 
The scholars of the Standing Committee were 
    asked about playing Foosball (table soccer) and the ruling on the loser paying for the game. They said:  
If the game mentioned involves images or 
    figures for playing with and the loser pays the cost of using the game, then this is haraam for a number of reasons: 
1 – This game is a kind of idle entertainment 
    that causes the player to waste his free time and to miss neglect many of his worldly and religious interests. Playing this game may become a 
    habit and a means that leads to worse things than that, such as forms of gambling. Everything that is like that is falsehood and is haraam 
    according to sharee’ah. 
2 – Making and keeping images and figures is 
    a major sin, because of the saheeh ahaadeeth in which Allaah and His Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warn those who do 
    that of Hell and a painful torment. 
3 – It is haraam for the loser to pay the 
    cost of using the game, because this is extravagance and a waste of money by spending it on idle entertainment. Rental of the game is an invalid 
    transaction and the owner’s earnings in this case are haraam and earning money by invalid means. So this is a major sin and a form of gambling, 
    which is haraam.

20983,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20983,"The punishment for zina (fornication, adultery) and how to keep oneself from going back to it","The problem is that I am a young man of thirty years of age. I got to know a girl who is nineteen years old who used all kinds of means to get to know me and get close to me. Without much talk or discussion, she went with me to my flat and I had intercourse with her dozens of times. There was a moment when I felt that I was about to die and I wanted to repent. I went to my father and asked him to get me married, and in fact I got married to a righteous girl from a respectable family. My main aim in marriage was to seek a woman who was religiously-committed, and this is what happened, for she is religious and is the daughter of a respected shaykh. 
But my problem has become worse. Despite the fact that I have been successfully married – in everyone else’s eyes – for over a year and a half, I suddenly realized that I still feel love for the first girl with whom I had intercourse, and I am not able to leave her. Since I got married, I have not touched her or gone near her, but not a day goes by without me getting in touch with her by phone, and I do not want to hide from you the fact that I masturbate with my hand while I am speaking to her on the phone. I feel as if I am trapped by this girl and now she is not after me as much as I am after her. When we meet I feel scared to touch her, because I fear going back to zina. 
My problem is simply psychological, which is how to discipline [?] myself and convince myself to keep away from this girl for once and for all, even though my wife is more beautiful than her and is better and she does everything she can to keep me chaste. Hence I despair of myself and I do not know how to sort myself out, despite the fact that everyone around me describes me as being good-hearted, loving good for people, shedding tears for the calamities and needs that befall people; they say that I try harder to do good for people than they do themselves, happily and willingly, and without them knowing about that, following the words of the Messenger of Allaah, “A man who gives in charity and conceals it so that his left hand does not know what his right hand is giving.”
 Please help me to that I can be content with myself and be a righteous person.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We ask Allah to relieve your distress and that of everyone who is distressed. From your question we may note the following: 
1 – The fact that you have cut off the route to the Shaytaan, and are preventing him from continuing to tempt you, by getting married is something commendable, which points – in sha Allah – to the goodness in your heart. 
2 – In order for you to be sincere towards your Lord in your repentance, and so that Allah may change your bad deeds (sayi’aat) into good deeds (hasanaat), you have to stop thinking about the first woman. Do not follow in the footsteps of the Shaytaan, and do not get carried away thinking about her, let alone speaking to her on the telephone, let alone meeting her, let alone doing anything that is more serious than that. 
3 – Since it was thinking of death that led you to leave the first woman and get married, you should never stop thinking of it. This is the best advice a person may be given, whether he is falling short in obeying Allah, or he is doing something that earns the wrath of Allah. This is what gives the one who is falling short the motive to strive, because when death comes, good deeds are no longer recorded. It also gives the one who is doing evil actions the motive to stop and give them up, because a person’s deeds are judged according to his last deeds. It is sufficient for you to think of one thing: what if Allah were to take your soul when you were masturbating while talking to this woman? What if Allah were to take your soul when you were having unlawful intercourse with her? 
My brother, think about it. Do you want to come out of your grave on the day when mankind is resurrected, holding onto your private part? Do you not see the great difference between this and between being resurrected prostrating or reciting the Talbiyah (as on Hajj or ‘Umrah) or remembering Allah? 
4 – The way in which you describe yourself makes us feel that there is much that is good in you, so beware of losing the reward for this goodness by having a bad end. Beware of depriving yourself of the reward for these virtues by committing such a major sin that will bring the wrath of your Lord upon you.  
5 – You have no excuse for this relationship, for you are married to a woman who – as you say – is more beautiful and is better than the first one, so why not thank Allah for giving you a halaal means of satisfying your desires? Why are you not content with that which Allah has decreed for you of permissible things? 
Your sin in doing these haraam deeds is worse than if you were not married. You are not single, rather Allah has blessed you with the means of satisfying your desires in a permissible way. So whenever the Shaytaan makes you think of her (the first woman), go to your wife and seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytaan. 
6 – We give you the best advice, which is to make du’aa’. Get up in the latter part of the night and beseech your Lord, submitting yourself to Him and humbling yourself before His Majesty, asking Him to rid you of the problem. Turn to your Lord and call upon Him, for He is the best One to be asked – may He be glorified – and He does not turn away His slaves if they are sincere. 
7 – Do you know that by thinking of this girl, getting in touch with her and meeting her, the Shaytaan may cause you to fall into that which you did before? I hope that you will not be over-confident and think that you will be able to resist, for the one who is ruled by his desires is weak, and whoever walks for a few steps with the Shaytaan will walk with him to the end. But you should know that you are incurring the wrath of the Compeller (al-Jabbaar) and that you are committing one of the gravest acts of disobedience against Allah after shirk. 
Imaam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: I do not know of any sin after murder that is worse than zina, and he quoted as evidence the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood who said: “O Messenger of Allah, which sin is the worst?” He said, “Setting up a rival to Allah when He is the One Who created you.” [‘Abd-Allah] said: “Then what?” He said, “Killing your child for fear that he may eat with you.” [‘Abd-Allah] said, “Then what?” He said, “Committing adultery with your neighbour’s wife.” And confirmation of that was revealed in the Qur’aan: 
 
“And those who invoke not any other ilaah (god) along with Allah, nor kill such person as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment”
[al-Furqaan 25:68] 
You must also understand the effects that zina has on the soul (or on one’s psyche). Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
Zina encompasses all the characteristics of evil: lack of religious commitment, loss of piety, loss of chivalry, lack of protective jealousy (gheerah). You will not find any adulterer who is pious, or keeps his promises, or speaks truthfully, or is a good friend, or has complete protective jealousy towards his family. Treachery, lying, betrayal, lack of modesty, lack of awareness that Allah is always watching, lack of chivalry, loss of protective jealousy from the heart – these are the effects and implications of zina. 
One of the effects of zina is that it earns the wrath of Allah because His sacred limits are transgressed. If a man were to do such a thing to any king, he would meet the direst consequences. Another effect of zina is the darkening of the face, and the grimness and misert of face that are apparent to other people. Another effect of zina is darkness of the heart and the extinguishing of its light, which is what causes the extinguishing of light in the face and the darkening thereof. Another effect of zina is the poverty that it leads to. Another effect of zina is the loss of respect towards the one who does it, and the lowering of his status in the eyes of his Lord and in the eyes of His slaves. Another effect of zina is that is causes him to lose the best of attributes, namely chastity, goodness and righteousness, and it earns him their opposites, namely immorality, evildoing, adultery and betrayal. Another effect of zina is that it causes him to lose the title of believer, as it was narrated in al-Saheehayn that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No adulterer is a believer at the moment when he is committing adultery.” Another of the effects of zina is that it exposes one to the possibility of being one of the inhabitants of the oven (tannoor) in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw the adulterers and adulteresses. Another of the effects of zina is that it takes away the goodness which Allah described as the attribute of those who are chaste, and replaces it with the evil which Allah described as the attribute of the adulterers, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Bad statements are for bad people (or bad women for bad men) and bad people for bad statements (or bad men for bad women). Good statements are for good people (or good women for good men) and good people for good statements (or good men for good women)”
[al-Noor 24:26]
Allah has forbidden Paradise to every evil person, and He has made Paradise the abode of the good, and no one will enter it but those who are good. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Those whose lives the angels take while they are in a pious state (i.e. pure from all evil, and worshipping none but Allah Alone) saying (to them): Salaamun ‘Alaykum (peace be on you) enter you Paradise, because of that (the good) which you used to do (in the world)”
[al-Nahl 16:32]
“and its keepers will say: Salaamun ‘Alaykum (peace be upon you)! You have done well, so enter here to abide therein”
[al-Zumar 39:73]
So they will deserve the greeting of the angels and admission to Paradise because of their goodness. But the adulterers are among the most evil of creation, and Allah has made Hell the abode of evil and its people. When the Day of Resurrection comes, the evil will be distinct from the good, and the evil will be piled up together, then it and its people will be thrown into Hell. No one who is good will enter Hell and no one who is evil will enter Paradise. Another of the effects of zina is the sense of alienation which Allah instills in the heart of the adulterer, and this is like the alienation that shows on his face. For the one who is chaste has sweetness in his face and contentment in his heart, and whoever sits with him feels at ease with him. But the adulterer has signs of alienation in his face and whoever sits with him will feel uneasy. Another of the effects of zina is lack of respect, as his family, friends and others lose respect for him, and he becomes the most despicable thing in their sight; this is in contrast to the chaste person, who is blessed with dignity and sweetness. Another of the effects of zina is that people will regard him as a traitor and no one will trust him with regard to his wife or child. Another of the effects of zina is the foul odour that will emanate from him and be detected by everyone who has a sound heart; it will emanate from his mouth and body, and were it not for the fact that there are all the people have a similar odour, that smell would spread far and wide. 
Another of the effects of zina is that he will feel uneasy and distressed, for adulterers are doing the opposite of what they are seeking. Whoever seeks the enjoyment and good things of life by means of that which Allah has forbidden, Allah will punish him by letting him get the opposite of that which he is trying to achieve. For that which is with Allah can only be attained by obeying Him, and Allah never makes disobedience towards Him the means of attaining anything good. If the immoral person only knew what delight, happiness, ease and good living there is in chastity, he would realize that the delights that he has missed out on are many times greater than those which he may have enjoyed, let alone the consequences in the Hereafter, when the chaste person will attain the reward of Allah and will be honoured by Him. Another of the effects of zina is that he has exposed himself to missing out on the delights of al-hoor al-‘iyn in the beautiful abodes of the Garden of Eden (Jannaat ‘Adan). We have stated above that Allah will punish those who wear silk in this world by depriving them of it on the Day of Resurrection, and He will punish those who drink wine in this world by depriving them of it on the Day of Resurrection. Similarly, those who enjoy forbidden images in this world will also be deprived of such in the Hereafter. Indeed, everything that a person gets in this world, if he indulges in it by permissible means, his share of it on the Day of Resurrection will be reduced to the extent that he indulged in it. And if he got it from haraam sources, he will lose out on it altogether on the Day of Resurrection. Another of the effects of zina is that zina leads to cutting the ties of kinship, disobedience towards parents, haraam earnings, mistreating others, neglect of one's wife and children, and it may even lead a person to shed blood unlawfully. He may seek help to commit zina by means of sihr (witchcraft) and shirk, and he may or not know that this sin inevitably includes other sins committed beforehand or alongside it, and that it leads to other kinds of sins that come after it. It is surrounded by a host of other sins that come before and after. It is the thing that is most likely to bring about evil in this world and the Hereafter, and the most likely to prevent good in this world and in the Hereafter. If a person falls into its traps and snares, it will be hard for sincere people to save him and for doctors to treat him; its prisoner cannot easily be ransomed, and its victim cannot be rescued. It also leads to the loss of blessings. If a person falls into this trap, let him bid farewell to the blessings of Allah, for blessings may easily depart from a person and vanish. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“That is so because Allah will never change a grace which He has bestowed on a people until they change what is in their ownselves. And verily, Allah is All-Hearer, All‑Knower”
[al-Anfaal 8:53]
 “But when Allah wills a people’s punishment, there can be no turning back of it, and they will find besides Him no protector”

 These are some of the harmful effects of this action.

 We advise you to read a book by Ibn al-Qayyim which is very useful with regard to this topic. It is al-Jawaab al-Kaafi li man sa’ala ‘ala al-Dawaa’ al-Shaafi.
 Finally, we ask Allah to keep you safe and sound with regard to your religious commitment and your worldly affairs, and to help you put your affairs in order before you meet your Lord. And Allah is the Guide to the Straight Path.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
20993,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20993,Ruling on contests where buying something is a necessary condition of entry,"It has become common in newspapers, stores, gas stations, Quran memorization institutes, charities and some restaurants to see so-called contests and incentives to buy, whereby the newspaper offers a draw on the condition that entries be made on the entry form printed in the newspaper itself, and it is not permitted to use copied forms or forms belonging to a newspaper that is not for sale. Similarly, stores may give everyone who spends more than a set minimum amount one or more tickets to enter a draw for prizes offered by the store.
Gas stations may give each person who fills his car up one or more handkerchiefs or a card every time he fills up, until when he has a certain number of cards he earns a free car wash or oil change.
Laundries may give a discount to those who pay a certain amount in advance for washing their clothes, so that for a specific amount he will get a 10% discount. The more he pays, the greater the discount will be. Some TV channels have contests where viewers have to call in in order to enter the contest via special chips which are offered for sale by those who organize these contests.
A similar case is the so-called deposit certificates in the banks, where some banks hold contests using tickets given to those who deposit a certain minimum amount in the bank and leave it there until the draw is over, after which the amount deposited is returned to its owner. 
The questioner is asking about the ruling on these contests and prizes.",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
With regard to contests which consist of a draw for prizes, if the person who wants to enter the contest can only do so by paying a sum of money, whether large or small, in such a way that there is the possibility of his losing this money and this chance is very high, such as the chances of winning being 1 in 10,000 or more, then this kind of contest comes under the heading of gambling. This is what is known nowadays as a lottery or raffle. For example, one person offers his car for 100,000 riyals, and he issues ten thousand tickets, selling each ticket for ten riyals, then he makes a draw and one ticket will win while all the others lose.
But if the contest does not require participants to pay money, such as Quran-reading contests for old and young, and it does not dictate that responses be given on a certain type of paper, then these competitions are permissible and may be mustahabb (encouraged), because they offer an incentive to recite the Book of Allaah and learn about its meanings. A similar case is the academic competitions where no loss is involved in entering the contest as the answers may be given on any kind of paper.
Based on the above, we can say that the newspaper competitions which are widespread in our media are a kind of lottery, whereby the entrant loses the value of the ticket in most cases, and very rarely wins. Undoubtedly this is a form of gambling, consuming people’s wealth unlawfully, deceiving people and wasting money. One of the editors of one of our newspapers told me that the paper he edits used to print forty thousand copies daily, of which nearly ten thousand copies would be returned. After this newspaper started to run contests, their print run rose to 300,000 copies daily, with no copies being returned. Contestants were buying huge numbers of papers, not to read them but just to cut out the entry forms so that they could enter the contests by submitting more than one form.
Undoubtedly this is a kind of lottery and is a kind of gambling. I wish that our brothers who are in charge of our newspapers would fear Allaah with regard to their country and their countrymen and with regard to their earnings. I wish that those who are responsible for the media, those who are in charge of the press, would take a stand that is in accordance with the Islamic identity of our country and free themselves from blame before Allaah with regard to their responsibility to enjoin that which is good and forbid that which is evil.
The same applies to the TV contests which can only be entered by buying a certain chip for entering contests, and the draws run by stores via tickets which are only given to those who spend more than a certain amount. This means that the ticket has a value which is paid for in the bill, and this comes under the heading of a lottery or raffle.
Also included with these practices – contests run by newspapers, TV stations and stores – are the deposit certificates which permit entry to contests by giving depositors tickets, as mentioned in the question. The reason why these are included under the heading of lotteries or raffles even though the bank returns the deposit in full after the contest has ended is that the deposit has to remain frozen in the bank until the end of the draw, and this means that this deposit is rendered inactive and is not invested in favour of the one who deposits it; rather it is invested in favour of the bank and not in favour of its owner. What the bank takes from its investment of this deposit is equal to the amount of money paid by the one who wants to enter the contest in return for the deposit certificate, hence this practice comes under the same ruling as lotteries and raffles.","Al-Da’wah magazine, issue # 1796, p. 19"
20996,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20996,Can You Read Quran for the Dead?,"I have a mother who cannot read and I want to honour her. I often read Quran and dedicate the reward for that to her. When I heard that this is not permissible, I stopped doing it and I started to give money in charity on her behalf. 
Now she is still alive; will the reward for money or other things given in charity reach her whether she is alive or dead, or will only du`a reach her because that is the only thing mentioned in the hadith, “When a person dies all his deeds come to an end except three: a righteous son who will pray [make du`a] for him…”? If a person makes a lot of du`a for his parents during prayer and at other times, standing and sitting, does this hadith mean that he is righteous and can hope for reward from Allah? 
I hope that you can advise me, may Allah reward you with much good.",It is better for the believer not to do that and not to read Quran for either the dead or the living or to offer prayer or fast voluntarily on their behalf because there is no evidence for any of these things.,"Can you read the Quran for the dead or the living?


What benefits the dead?


Can you make Hajj on behalf of the dead of the living?


Can you fast on behalf of the dead?","Praise be to Allah.Can you read the Quran for the dead or the living?
With regard to reading Quran , there is some difference of opinion among the scholars as to whether the reward from that will reach the deceased . According to the more correct of the two opinions, it does not reach them, because there is no evidence to that effect. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do that for the Muslims who died, such as his daughters who died during his lifetime, neither did the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them all) do that either, as far as we know. 
So it is better for the believer not to do that and not to read Quran for either the dead or the living, or to offer prayer or fast voluntarily on their behalf because there is no evidence for any of these things. The basic principle regarding acts of worship is to refrain from everything except that which is proven to be enjoined by Allah or by His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
What benefits the dead?
With regard to charity, this may benefit both the living and the dead , according to the consensus of the Muslims. Similarly, du`a may benefit both the living and the dead according to the consensus of the Muslims. But the Hadith mentions that which has to do with the dead, because this is the point concerning which people are confused. Does it benefit them or not? Hence this Hadith was narrated from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “When the son of Adam dies, all his deeds come to an end, except for three: ongoing charity , beneficial knowledge or a righteous son who will pray for him.” Because it is known that death puts a stop to all deeds, the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained that these [three deeds] do not stop.
With regard to the living, there is no doubt that he will benefit from charity given by himself or by others, and he will benefit from du`a . If a person makes du`a for his parents whilst they are still alive, they will benefit from his du`a. They will also benefit from charity given on their behalf whilst they are still alive.
Can you make Hajj on behalf of the dead of the living?
The same applies to making Hajj on their behalf  if they are unable to go themselves because of old age or incurable sickness. This will also benefit them. Hence it was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that a woman said to him, “O Messenger of Allah, the obligation to perform Hajj has come when my father is an old man and is unable to ride. Can I perform Hajj on his behalf?” He said, “Perform Hajj on his behalf.” 
Another man came and said, “O Messenger of Allah, my father is an old man and he cannot perform Hajj or travel. Can I perform Hajj or `Umrah on his behalf ?” He said, “Perform Hajj and `Umrah on behalf of your father.” 
This indicates that it is permissible to perform Hajj on behalf of the dead or on behalf of one who is living but is unable to do it because he or she is too old. Charity, du`a and Hajj or ‘Umrah on behalf of the dead or one who is incapable will all benefit the person, according to all the scholars. 
Can you fast on behalf of the dead?
Similarly, it is obligatory to fast on behalf of the deceased if he had missed any obligatory fasts, whether they were fasts in fulfillment of a vow, or as an expiation, or any missed fasts of Ramadan, because of the general meaning of the Hadith, “Whoever dies and was obliged to fast, let his next of kin fast on his behalf.” (Sahih – Al-Bukhari and Muslim).
And there are other similar Hadiths. But whoever delayed the fast of Ramadan for a valid excuse such as sickness or traveling, then he died before he could make up the missed fasts, it is not obligatory to make up the fasts or to feed poor people on his behalf, because he had a valid excuse. 
You are doing well, in sha Allah, by honouring your mother by giving in charity on her behalf and making du`a for her. Especially if the son is righteous, this makes the du`a more likely to be answered. Hence the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “… or a righteous son who will pray for him,” because the righteous son is more likely to have his du`a answered than a son who is not righteous, even though everyone is required to make du`a for his parents. But if the son is righteous then his du`a for his parents is more likely to be answered. 
And Allah knows best.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaha have mercy on him), vol 4, p. 348"
