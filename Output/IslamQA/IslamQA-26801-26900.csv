26801,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26801,Ruling on go-betweens,"What is the ruling on go-betweens, and is that haraam? For example, if I want to get a job, or enter a school, and so on, and I use the services of a go-between, what is the ruling on that?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: if the services of a person who intercedes on your 
    behalf with regard to a job will result in a person who is more deserving of 
    that position because of his qualifications and his ability to do the job in 
    a more precise manner being deprived of it, then that intercession is 
    haraam, because it is injustice against one who is more deserving of it, and 
    it is unfair to the person who is in charge of that work because it is 
    depriving him of the services of one who is more qualified and better able 
    to help them advance in this area of life. This is also an injustice against 
    the ummah because it is depriving it of one who could serve the ummah and 
    direct its affairs in this field in the best possible manner. Moreover it 
    generates resentment and suspicion, and corrupts society. But if this 
    intercession does not result in infringement of anyone’s rights then it is 
    permissible, and indeed it is encouraged by sharee’ah and the one who 
    intercedes will be rewarded, in sha Allaah. It was proven that the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Intercede, and you 
    will be rewarded, and Allaah decrees what He wills on the lips of His 
    Messenger.” (al-Bukhaari, 1342). 

    Secondly: schools, institutes and universities are public resources of the ummah, in which they can learn that which will benefit them in their spiritual and worldly affairs. No one in the ummah is more entitled to it than anyone else except on the basis of some consideration other than intercession on his behalf. If the intercessor knows that his intercession will result in someone who is more entitled because of his qualifications, age or because he submitted his application first, etc, being deprived, then his intercession is not allowed, because it will result in injustice against the one who is deprived or is forced to go to a school that is further away, so it will become difficult for him, because that will generate resentment and will corrupt society. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.","Al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, Fataawa Islamiyyah, 4/300"
26804,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26804,Her mother wants to give her a birthday party – what should she do?,"I managed to find out that my mother, who is not Muslim, is planning to give me a surprise party on my birthday. What is the ruling on that? If it is not permissible, then how can I avoid upsetting my mother (by refusing)?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly:  
With regard to this observance which people call “birthdays” (eid milaad in Arabic), Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) issued the following fatwa: 
“Everything which is taken as an ‘eid’ (something which is celebrated regularly) and is repeated each week or each year and is not prescribed in sharee’ah, is a kind of bid’ah (reprehensible innovation). The evidence for that is the fact that the Lawgiver prescribed ‘aqeeqah for the newborn, and did not prescribe anything after that. When they adopt these observances every week or every year, it means that they are making them like the Islamic Eids, which is haram and is not permitted. There are no celebrations in Islam apart from the three prescribed Eids: ‘Eid al-Fitr, ‘Eid al-Adha, and the weekly ‘Eid’ which is Friday (Yawm al-Jumu’ah). 
This does not come under the heading of customs because it is repeated. Hence when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Madeenah and found that the Ansaar had two festivals which they used to celebrate, he said, ‘Allah has given you something better than these: Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr.’ (Narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 1556; Abu Dawood, 1134; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth al-Saheehah, no. 124), even though this was one of their customs.” 
From Sharh Kitab al-Tawheed, 1/382; see also Question # 1027. 
Secondly: 
With regard to how you should deal with your mother, I think that you should be frank with her, and tell her that this action is not permitted by Allah, and that the religion of Islam forbids this, and that as this is the case you cannot come to this party. Tell her. “Were it not for the fact that Allah does not allow it, I would have been happy to come, and I thank you, but it is not up to me or anyone else, it is up to Allah Who issues His decree and we – the Muslims – have to submit to His will; it is not permissible for us to dispute that so long as it is the command of Allah, the All-Knowing, Most Wise.” 
Tell her all of that in the best possible manner and in the kindest way. If she is convinced and appreciates that, then praise be to Allah, otherwise try to be outside the house at the time of this party, so that no one will pressure you to join in and so that you yourself will not weaken and given in. There is no sin on you for what your mother is doing, and pleasing Allah comes before pleasing any of His creation. Be certain that if your mother objects vehemently to this matter today, perhaps Allah will make her pleased with you in the future, in sha Allah.",Islam Q&A
26806,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26806,It takes too long for the urine to stop after he urinates,"My problem is of urination problem, i loss a few quantity of urine during about 5 or 10 minutes after urination and this pbliged me to wait about 15 minutes to be sure and so to do also the prayer that i delay about 20 minutes and i don't loss urine in any others situation.so is there any solution to do the prayer in time or should i wait and repeat the wudu. this problem made my life complicated.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The sharee’ah of Islam is an easy-going law 
    which relieves people’s hardship and makes things easy for them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and has not laid upon you in religion any 
    hardship”
[al-Hajj 22:78]
What you have asked about is not something that should cause any anxiety or frustration or 
    despair, because whatever happens to you is a test from Allaah and you will be rewarded for bearing it with patience. You should note that the 
    religion of Allaah is easy in all things. If this is what usually happens to you and you know that the urine will stop after five or ten minutes, 
    then what this means is that you should get up ten minutes before the time (for prayer) so that you can urinate and wait for it to stop, then you 
    can do wudoo’. If we assume that you get up late and you need to urinate, there is no sin on you if you urinate and wait for it to stop, even if 
    you miss the prayer in congregation, because in this case you are excused, as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “There is no prayer when food is ready or when a person needs to relieve himself (of either urine or stools).” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 560). 
    Based on this, we say: Allow enough time before the time of prayer to let the urine stop, but if you cannot manage that then you should wait, even 
    if you miss the prayer in congregation, if you are desperate and cannot focus on anything else. And Allaah is the Source of strength,

26807,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26807,Employees whose work means that they have to continue working at the time of Jumu’ah,"Some sensitive jobs require the constant presence of an employee, including at the times of obligatory prayers and Jumu’ah (Friday) prayers. Should these employees leave their work and go and pray, or should they stay on the job?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The basic principle is that Jumu’ah prayer is obligatory upon 
    individuals, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “O 
    you who believe (Muslims)! When the call is proclaimed for the Salaah 
    (prayer) on Friday (Jumu‘ah prayer), come to the remembrance of Allaah 
    [Jumu‘ah religious talk (Khutbah) and Salaah (prayer)] and leave off 
    business (and every other thing). That is better for you if you did but 
    know!”

    [al-Jumu’ah 62:9]
And Imam Ahmad narrated 
    from Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said concerning some people who 
    were failing to attend Jumu’ah prayers: “I had thought to tell a man to lead 
    the people in prayer, then I would burn down the houses of men who fail to 
    attend Jumu’ah prayers.” (Ahmad, 1/402; Muslim, 1/452). Muslim narrated from 
    Abu Hurayrah and Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them) that they heard 
    the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say 
    from the minbar: “There are people who should stop neglecting Jumu’ah, or 
    else Allaah will put a seal on their hearts, then they will surely be among 
    the negligent.” And there is consensus among the scholars on this point 
    (that Jumu’ah is obligatory). But if a person for whom Jumu’ah is obligatory 
    has a legitimate shar’i excuse – such as one who is directly responsible for 
    a matter of national security and protecting the interests of the ummah, and 
    he is required to do that job at the time of Jumu’ah, such as those who are 
    in charge of security, traffic, wireless and telephone communications, etc, 
    those whose shift happens to be at the time of the second call to Jumu’ah 
    prayers or the time of a prayer in congregation – then such people are 
    excused for not praying Jumu’ah or prayers in congregation, because of the 
    general meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So keep your duty to 
    Allaah and fear Him as much as you can”
[al-Taghaabun 64:16]
And the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whatever I 
    forbid you to do, avoid it, and whatever I command you to do, do as much of 
    it as you can.” Moreover, such a person has no less an excuse than one who 
    is excused because he fears for his life or his wealth etc., who the 
    scholars have said is excused for not praying Jumu’ah or prayers in 
    congregation so long as the reason is present. But the obligation to pray 
    Zuhr still stands, and he must pray it on time; whenever he can pray in 
    congregation he is obliged to do that, as is the case with all the five 
    daily obligatory prayers.","Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth wa’l-Ifta’, 8/189"

26810,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26810,He was told that his wife had revived a previous forbidden relationship so he divorced her,"My friend got divorced in this Ramzan and his wife was(is) 5 months pregnant as well  .

The reason for divorce was that his wife had boy friends before marriage and someone said that after marriage also she would meet her ex boy friends .

On this reason he divorced her and under the influence of his parents.

Now what i want to know is was that a right path , did it have Allah's Sanction to this deed ? 

what about the child who is in the womb ? What will happen to that baby and his/her future ?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    What you have mentioned in the question covers a number of 
    issues: 

    1 – What you have mentioned about your friend divorcing his 
    wife during her pregnancy is valid according to the consensus of the 
    scholars, because of the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar in al-Saheehayn, 
    according to which the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “Tell him to take her back, then to divorce her when she is pure 
    (not menstruating) or pregnant.” That indicates that whoever divorces (his 
    wife when she is) pregnant, the divorce is valid. (Fataawa al-Talaaq 
    by Ibn Baaz, 1/45). 

    2 – With regard to the reason that led him to divorce her, 
    which is that person telling him that she had been meeting with her former 
    boyfriend after marriage, we advise those who want to pass things on to make 
    sure that any news is true before they pass it on, and that their intentions 
    are good. Her husband too should have checked whether what he was told was 
    true or not, and not divorce her on these grounds without verifying 
    anything. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “O you who believe! If a Faasiq (liar — evil person) comes 
    to you with any news, verify it, lest you should harm people in ignorance, 
    and afterwards you become regretful for what you have done”

    [al-Hujuraat 49:6]

    Hastening to divorce one’s wife without verifying anything 
    and without giving oneself time to think it over is a rejection of the 
    blessing of marriage for no valid reason and destroying the family which is 
    a blessing that Allaah has bestowed upon the children of Adam, as Allaah 
    says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And among His Signs is this, that He created for you 
    wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has 
    put between you affection and mercy. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a 
    people who reflect” [al-Room 30:21]

    If he finds out that something displeasing is true, then he 
    may try to correct it through the means which he is permitted to use by 
    virtue of his being in charge of his wife (qiwaamah), or he may 
    separate from her, whilst also concealing her sin. 

    3 – If the wife had previous relationships, before marriage, 
    then she got married and repented to Allaah, and broke off all forbidden 
    relationships, then she should not be rebuked for what is in the past, 
    because the one who has repented from a sin is like one who has never 
    sinned. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and 
    forgives sins” [al-Shoora 42:25]

    It is not permissible to expose her, to tell everyone about 
    her or to call her to account for the past; rather he should cover up her 
    past and her secrets; whoever conceals the faults of a Muslim, Allaah will 
    cover his faults in this world and in the Hereafter. 

    Such cases explain to us the wisdom of the sharee’ah in 
    forbidding everything that may lead to an improper relationship between a 
    man and a woman, such as looking at a non-mahram woman, shaking hands with 
    her, being alone with her, and so on, whether that is before marriage or 
    afterwards. 

    4 – With regard to the husband’s parents applying pressure on 
    him to divorce her without any proof of the things of which she had been 
    accused, obedience to parents should only be with regard to that which is 
    good and proper, things that Allaah and His Messenger  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) have permitted. The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Obedience is only with regard to 
    that which is good and proper.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7245; Muslim, 
    1840). His parents’ orders to hasten to divorce her with no proven sin on 
    the wife’s part is not something which is good and proper. 

    5 – With regard to the foetus in her womb, the basic 
    principle in sharee’ah is that that the child belongs to the (marriage-) bed 
    and belongs to the husband, unless he disowns him, because of the hadeeth of 
    the Prophet: ‘The child belongs to the (marriage-)bed and the adulterer is 
    to be stoned.” (al-Bukhaari, 2053; Muslim, 1457). 

    i.e., the child is to be attributed to the husband and no 
    attention is to be paid to doubts and the like, especially in a case like 
    this where the doubts are far-fetched. Islam encourages us to attribute 
    children to their fathers, so this husband should not open the door to 
    waswaas (whispers of the Shaytaan) with regard to his son who will be born 
    to the wife he has divorced, because he has no evidence to the contrary. 

    If this husband wants to go back to his wife after this 
    divorce (talaaq), if she is still pregnant and he issued the talaaq once or 
    twice, then she is still his wife according to sharee’ah, because her ‘iddah 
    has not yet ended. Allaah says: 

    “And for those who are pregnant (whether they are divorced 
    or their husbands are dead), their ‘Iddah (prescribed period) is until they 
    lay down their burden” [al-Talaaq 65:4]

    So he may take her back and ask two men to bear witness that 
    he is taking her back; in this way she will become his wife again.  

    But if she has already given birth and this was the first or 
    second talaaq, then he may go back to her with a new contract, so long as it 
    meets all the necessary conditions.  And he should beware of such news and 
    take care to protect his wife and keep her away from places which may give 
    rise to suspicion. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
26811,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26811,controlling Urges Through Fasting,"My question is about fasting. But it is not concerning the Holy month Ramadan. I mean fasting when one wants to marry but has not the ability to do this at the moment. I know that in Islam it is prescribed for this purpose, but I do not know what is the right ruling on this. I would like to learn the exact time for iftar and sahur, how many days in the month one should fast, and exactly which day of the week it is supposed to be as well. Please provide me with as many details as you can about that. And Allah knows best. May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon all of you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This pure monotheistic religion came to teach people how to control urges so that the Muslim individual who is distinguished by his character and behaviour would not remain a prisoner to his desires like an animal. Islam prescribes rulings, both obligatory and mustahabb (recommended), to protect him against the bad effects of being driven by his desires. Among these rulings is the prescription of fasting for those who cannot find the natural outlet for these desires in marriage, as ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated, “We were young men with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and we did not have anything (i.e., we could not afford to get married). The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to us, ‘O young men, whoever among you can afford to get married, then let him do so, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding chastity. And whoever is not able to do that, then let him fast, for that will be a shield for him.’” (al-Bukhaari, 5066; Muslim, 1400). Fasting reduces the effects that desires have on young people.
 Although this ruling is addressed to young men, it may become more essential when there is more temptation and the means and motives for committing evil increase, especially for those who live in societies in which there is a great deal of wanton display and promiscuity. So they should be keen to do this act of worship in order to protect their chastity and religious commitment. As well as fasting, a person may seek help though praying to Allah to protect his religious commitment and honour, and to make it easy for him to get married, as marriage protects one's chastity. He may also help himself by remembering the reward in Paradise that Allah has prepared for those who steadfastly obey His commands and guard their chastity, namely al-hoor al-‘iyn (maidens in Paradise).",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

The reason why they have to make up the fast is that they did not have the intention of fasting from the night before. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever does not make the intention before dawn, there is no fast for him.” 
Narrated by Ahmad, 6/287; Abu Dawood, no. 2454; al-Tirmidhi, 730; al-Nasaa’i, 2331; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 2143.",Islam Q&A
26814,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26814,Is Fasting Compulsory?,For whom is fasting Ramadan obligatory?,"Fasting is compulsory on a person if he fulfils five conditions: 1- He is a Muslim, 2- He is accountable (mukallaf), 3- He is able to fast, 4- He is settled (not travelling), and 5- There are no impediments to fasting.",,"Praise be to Allah.“Fasting is obligatory for a person if he fulfils five conditions: 

He is a Muslim
He is accountable (mukallaf)
He is able to fast
He is settled (not travelling)
There are no impediments to fasting

If these five conditions are met, then it is obligatory for a person to fast . 

Non-Muslims are excluded from the first condition. The non-Muslim is not obliged to fast and his fast is not valid. If he becomes Muslim, he is not obliged to make up fasts from before. 

The evidence for that is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And nothing prevents their contributions from being accepted from them except that they disbelieved in Allah and in His Messenger (Muhammad) and that they came not to As-Salah (the prayer) except in a lazy state, and that they offer not contributions but unwillingly” [Al-Tawbah 9:54]
If the contribution is not acceptable even though it benefits others, because of their disbelief, then other acts of worship may be even more unacceptable. 
He does not have to make up fasts if he becomes Muslim because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say to those who have disbelieved, if they cease (from disbelief), their past will be forgiven.” [Al-Anfal 8:38]
And it was proven in mutawatir reports that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not tell those who became Muslim to make up the obligatory duties that they had missed. 

Will the non-Muslim be punished in the Hereafter for not fasting if he did not become Muslim? 

The answer is: 
Yes, he will be punished for not fasting, and for not doing any other obligatory duties, because if the Muslim who obeyed Allah and adhered to His laws will be punished for that, then it is more apt that he (the kafir) should be punished. If the kafir is to be punished for the blessings of Allah that he enjoyed, such as food, drink and clothing, then it is more appropriate that he will be punished for doing haram actions and not doing obligatory duties. This is by way of analogy.  
With regard to the texts, Allah says that those on the Right (i.e., the believers) will say to the disbelievers:  
“‘What has caused you to enter Hell?’
They will say: ‘We were not of those who used to offer the Salah (prayers), Nor used we to feed Al-Miskin (the poor); And we used to talk falsehood (all that which Allah hated) with vain talkers. And we used to belie the Day of Recompense’” [Al-Muddaththir 74:42]
These four things are what will cause them to enter Hell. 
“We were not of those who used to offer the Salah (prayers)” means they did not pray; “Nor used we to feed Al-Miskin (the poor)” means they did not pay zakah; “And we used to talk falsehood (all that which Allah hated) with vain talkers” means things like mocking the verses of Allah;  “And we used to belie the Day of Recompense.” 

The second condition: 

He should be accountable (mukallaf). The one who is mukallaf is one who has reached the age of puberty and is of sound mind, because a minor or one who is insane is not accountable. Puberty is reached when one of three signs is noticed.
The one who is of sound mind is the opposite of one who is insane, which is one who has lost his mind, whether he is insane or feeble-minded. Everyone who has lost his mind, in whatever sense, is not accountable and he is not obliged to do any of the obligatory duties of Islam, be it prayer, fasting or feeding the poor; he does not have to do anything at all. 

The third condition: 

Being able to fast. The one who is unable to fast does not have to fast, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days.” [Al-Baqarah 2:185]
But being unable to fast falls into two categories: temporary inability and permanent inability. 
Temporary inability is that which is mentioned in the verse quoted above, such as one who is sick but hopes to recover, and the traveller. These people are allowed not to fast, then they have to make up for what they missed. 
Those who are permanently unable to fast, such as one who is sick and has no hope of recovery, or those who are elderly and are unable to fast, are mentioned in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed aMiskin (poor person) (for every day).” [Al-Baqarah 2:184]
As Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) interpreted it, it refers to the old man and old woman who are not able to fast, so they should feed one poor person for each day. 

The fourth condition: 

He should be settled (not travelling). If he is travelling then it is not obligatory for him to fast, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days.” [Al-Baqarah 2:185]
The scholars agreed that it is permissible for a traveller not to fast . 
It is better for the traveller to do that which is easier. If fasting is likely to be harmful then it becomes haram to fast, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And do not kill yourselves (nor kill one another). Surely, Allah is Most Merciful to you.” [Al-Nisa 4:29] 
This indicates that whatever is harmful to a person is forbidden to him. 

If you ask, what is the degree of harm which makes fasting haram? 

The answer is: 
Harm may be physical, or someone advises him that fasting may harm him. With regard to physical harm, that means that the sick person feels that fasting is harming him and causing him pain, and will delay his recovery and so on. 
With regard to being advised, this means that a knowledgeable and trustworthy doctor tells him that it will harm him. 

The fifth condition: 

There should be no impediments. This applies specifically to women. Women who are menstruating or bleeding following childbirth should not fast, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Is it not the case that when she gets her period, she does not pray or fast?” 
So she should not fast and her fast is not valid in this case, according to scholarly consensus. And she has to make up for the days missed, also according to scholarly consensus.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/330)

“Bad statements are for bad people (or bad women for bad men) and bad people for bad statements (or bad men for bad women). Good statements are for good people (or good women for good men) and good people for good statements (or good men for good women)…”
[al-Noor 24:26] 
Hence the shayaateen frequent the places where humans relieve themselves, and they want to do them harm. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has told us what we should do so that Allaah will protect us from the evil of the shayaateen when we enter the toilet. That is that before entering the place, the Muslim should say, “Bismillaah, Allaahumma inni a’oodhu bika min al-khubthi wa’l-khabaa’ith (In the name of Allaah, O Allaah, I seek refuge with You from evil and from the male and female devils).” 
Al-Tirmidhi (no. 606) narrated from ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A screen will be placed between the eyes of the jinn and the ‘awrah of the sons of Adam when one of them enters the toilet, if he says ‘Bismillaah (in the name of Allaah).” (Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 496). 
Abu Dawood (6) and Ibn Maajah (296) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “These toilets are visited (by jinn), so when any one of you goes to the toilet, let him say, ‘Allaahumma inni a’oodhu bika min al-khubthi wa’l-khabaa’ith (O Allaah, I seek refuge with You from evil and from the male and female devils).’” (Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah, 241). 
The word hushoosh, translated here as toilets, refers to places where people relieve themselves, and it includes the “water closets” that are in people’s houses. 
“Visited (by jinn)” means that they are frequented by the devils, with the intent to cause harm to people. 
Khubth means evil and khabaa’ith means evil souls, namely the devils, both male and female. So one is seeking refuge with Allaah from evil and from those who do evil. 
From ‘Awn al-Ma’bood. 
If the Muslim says this du’aa’ before entering the toilet, Allaah will grant him refuge from the devils. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
The benefit of saying Bismillaah is that it conceals a person. The benefit of seeking refuge with Allaah is that one is turning to Allaah from evil and from the male and female devils, for this place is filthy (khabeeth) and a filthy place is the abode of those who are evil (khubatha’).  So it is the abode  ofthe devils. Thus it is appropriate if one wants to enter the toilet to say  “A’oodhu Billaah min al-khubthi wa’l-khabaa’ith (I seek refuge with Allaah from evil and from the male and female devils)” so that he will not be harmed by evil or by the evil souls.

26817,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26817,"He stipulates an additional cost for purchase by installments, separate from the price","I wanted to buy a car by installments, but the vendor said to me: Choose the period after which you will pay the price, on condition that it is no more than a year. But this car costs thirty thousand in cash, and if bought by installments he will charge three percent each month. If I pay after one month he will charge three percent in addition to the price, after two months he will charge six percent, after ten months thirty percent, and so on. Is this halaal or haram?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Selling by installments for an increased price is permissible. 
But the scholars stated that the additional amount should not be stipulated in the form of interest that is separate from the price. If the vendor does that then the transaction is haram or makrooh. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (2/266): 
If he says, I will sell it to you at cost for one hundred, and I make a profit for one dirham for every ten, this was regarded as makrooh by Ahmad, and it was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar and Ibn ‘Abbaas that this is makrooh. We do not know of any of the Sahaabah who held a different opinion. It is regarded as makrooh but not in the sense of being haram. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Risaalah fi Aqsaam al-Mudaayanah: 
If in the contract the vendor says, “I will sell you this ten for eleven,” then it is either makrooh or haram. It was narrated that Imam Ahmad said of such cases, It is as if he is selling dirhams for dirhams, which is not right. This is what Imam Ahmad said. Based on this, the correct way of going about it is for the lender to work out the value of the product and the amount of his profit, then he should say to the borrower, “I will sell it to you for such and such to be paid in one year.”  
One of the resolutions issued by the Fiqh Council says the following: 
According to sharee’ah, it is not permissible when selling something to be paid for later, to stipulate in the contract interest on the installments that is separate from the price so that it is connected to the time involved, whether the two parties agree to a rate of interest or they decide to follow the current rate of interest used by the banks. 
The way of putting this matter right, as may be understood from the words of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen quoted above – is for the vendor to say to the purchaser, “When will you pay the price?” If he says, “After one year” – for example – the vendor should look at the value of the item and work out the amount of the profit he wants, then say to the purchaser, “I will sell it to you for such and such on the basis that you will pay after one year” – without stating an additional cost that is separate from the price.

The question is: who is that person of good character?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.In Arabic, the word ‘adl (translated here as person of good character) means upright or straight; its opposite is crooked. 
In sharee’ah terminology it means the one who fulfils the obligatory duties and does not commit major sins, or persist in committing minor sins. 
What is meant by fulfilling obligatory duties is things like the five daily prayers. 
And he does not commit major sins such as spreading malicious gossip and backbiting. 
As well as being of good character, he must also have strong eyesight, so that his claims may be believed. If he has weak eyesight then his testimony cannot be accepted even if he is of good character, because if he gives testimony even though his eyesight is weak, then he is deluded. 
The evidence for that is the fact that Allaah has made strength and trustworthiness among the reasons for offering employment to a person. In the story of Moosa and Shu’ayb, one of Shu’ayb’s two daughters said:  
“O my father! Hire him! Verily, the best of men for you to hire is the strong, the trustworthy”
[al-Qasas 28:26 – interpretation of the meaning]
And the ifreet among the jinn who was commanded to bring the throne of the queen of Saba’ said: 
“And verily, I am indeed strong and trustworthy for such work”

I need urgent advice in this matter? I am a young man and an immoral person. I have unclean thoughts and frequent erections. Just looking at a woman or if a woman merely touches me by mistake, I have an erection! .",,,"Praise be to Allah.With regard to what you have mentioned about 
    looking at your fiancée’s mother with desire, this does not mean that you are not allowed to marry her daughter, because what would prevent you 
    from marrying her (the daughter) is your marrying her mother and consummating the marriage with her. The evidence for that is the verse in which 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Forbidden to you (for marriage) are: … your stepdaughters under your guardianship, born of 
    your wives to whom you have gone in — but there is no sin on you if you have not gone in them (to marry their daughters),”
    [al-Nisa’ 4:23]
 But I advise you to fear Allaah and not take 
    the matter of looking lightly, for it is a serious matter, and the door to endless evil. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “Do not follow one glance with another, for you are allowed the first but not the second.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 277; Abu Dawood, 
    2147; Ahmad, 1373 – from ‘Ali, may Allaah be pleased with him).
 What you have mentioned about feeling desire 
    whenever you look, is because your mind is constantly preoccupied with sex. Undoubtedly the corrupt media play a great role in that, because their 
    aim is to occupy people’s minds with such things by spreading pornographic movies and pictures, and love stories. These are things that the Muslim 
    should keep away from.
 There is no reason why a person should not 
    satisfy his desires in the way in which Allaah has permitted, but for a man to live with no other thought than how to satisfy his desire, this is 
    something which every wise person should refrain from.
 You should realize that no one will live in 
    this world, rather this is the abode of striving. Man is like a stranger in this world. Think about the words of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) to Ibn ‘Umar – who was a young man – “Be in this world as if you are a stranger or just passing through.”
 Set your aim high and do not be content with 
    anything but the highest and noblest of things. The highest of things is the pleasure of Allaah and entering Paradise. If you set your aim high, 
    you will find that you are a new person, and the things you are suffering will disappear.
 I advise you to obey the command of the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “O young men, whoever among you can afford it, let him get married, and whoever cannot, 
    then let him fast, for it will be a shield for him.”
 (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5065; Muslim, 
    1400, from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood, may Allaah be pleased with him).
 Finally, I advise you to make du’aa’ and 
    turn to Allaah, for He will not let down the one who calls upon Him in sincerity and seriousness. Strive to control yourself, and keep away from 
    things that provoke your desire. Fill your heart with the love of Allaah and longing to meet Him.

26830,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26830,The family and Ramadaan,"I am the head of a household, and now Ramadaan is coming. How should I take care of my family and teach them during this blessed month?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is one of the blessings of Allaah to the Muslim that He enables him to fast in Ramadaan and to spend its nights in prayer. It is a month in which good deeds are multiplied and people are raised in status, when Allaah frees some people from the Fire. So the Muslim should strive to make the most of this month and the goodness it brings; he should hasten to spend his life in worship. How many people have been deprived of this month because of sickness, death or misguidance. 
The Muslim must make the most of his time during this month; he has an unavoidable duty towards his children, to raise them well and bring them up properly, to urge them to do all kinds of goodness and make them get used to that – because the child will grow up in the manner to which his father makes him get accustomed. 
During these blessed days, the father and mother have a role to play in making the most of this time, and we can offer parents the following advice: 
1 – Checking on the children’s fasting and encouraging those who fall short in this regard. 
2– Reminding them about the real nature of fasting, and that it is not just giving up food and drink, but it is a means of attaining taqwa (piety), and that it is an opportunity for sins to be forgiven and expiated. 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ascended the minbar and said: “Ameen, Ameen, Ameen.” It was said to him, “O Messenger of Allaah, why did you do that?” He said, “Jibreel said to me, ‘May Allaah rub his nose in the dust, that person who Ramadaan comes and his sins are not forgiven,’ and I said, ‘Ameen’. Then he said, ‘May Allaah rub his nose in the dust, that person who lives to see his parents grow old, one or both of them, but he does not enter Paradise,’ and I said, ‘Ameen’. Then he said, ‘May Allaah rub his nose in the dust, that person in whose presence you are mentioned and he does not send blessings upon you,’ and I said, ‘Ameen.’” 
Narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah, 1888; al-Tirmidhi, 3545; Ahmad, 7444; Ibn Hibbaan, 908. See Saheeh al-Jaami’, 3501. 
3 – Teaching them the etiquette and rulings on eating, such as eating with the right hand from what is directly in front of them; reminding them that extravagance is haraam and is harmful to the body. 
4 – Not letting them spend too long on eating iftaar so that they miss praying Maghrib in congregation. 
5 – Reminding them about the situation of the poor and destitute who cannot find even a mouthful of food to quench the fires of hunger; reminding them of the situation of those who have migrated or are fighting in jihad for the sake of Allaah in all places. 
6 – These gatherings offer an opportunity to bring relatives together and uphold the ties of kinship. This custom still exists in some countries, and it is an opportunity to reconcile and mend broken ties between relatives. 
7 – Helping the mother to prepare the food, and to clean up and keep the food fit for eating. 
8 – Reminding them to pray qiyaam (taraweeh) and to prepare for it by not eating too much and to get ready in time to perform the prayer in the mosque. 
9 – With regard to suhoor, the parents should remind the family of the barakah (blessing) of suhoor and that it gives a person the strength to fast. 
10 – Allowing enough time before Fajr prayer so that those who have not prayed Witr may do so, and so that those who have delayed their prayer until the end of the night may pray, and so that each person may make du’aa’ to his Lord as he wishes. 
11 – Paying attention to praying Fajr on time in congregation in the mosque, for those who are required to do so. We have seen many people who wake up at the end of the night to eat, then they go back to bed and neglect Fajr prayer. 
12 – It was the practice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the last ten days of Ramadaan to stay up at night and wake his family. This indicates that the family should pay attention to making the most of this blessed time in doing things that are pleasing to Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. So the husband should wake his wife and children to do that which will bring them closer to their Lord. 
13 – There may be small children in the house who need to be encouraged to fast, so the father should urge them to get up for suhoor, and encourage them to fast by praising them and giving a reward to the one who fasts the whole month or half of it, and so on. 
It was narrated that al-Rubayyi’ bint Mu’awwidh said:  On the morning of ‘Ashoora’ the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent word to the villages of the Ansaar saying, “Whoever started out not fasting, let him not eat for the rest of the day, and whoever started the day fasting, let him fast.” She said: We used to fast and make our children fast, [and take them to the mosques] and make toys for them out of wool, then if one of them cried for food we would give him that toy until iftaar.  
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1859; Muslim, 1136 – the words in square brackets were narrated by Muslim. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
This hadeeth shows that we should train children to do acts of worship and get them used to that, but they are not accountable. Al-Qaadi said: It was narrated from ‘Urwah that when they are able to fast it becomes obligatory upon them. This is a mistake which is disproven by the saheeh hadeeth, “The Pen is lifted from three: from the child until he reaches adolescence…” And Allaah knows best. 
Sharh Muslim, 8/14 
14 – If possible, the father and mother should take the family for ‘Umrah in Ramadaan, and that is something that will benefit them in the Hereafter,, themselves and their family, for ‘Umrah during Ramadaan has the same reward as Hajj. It is better to go at the beginning of Ramadaan so as to avoid the crowds. 
15 – The husband should not overburden his wife with more than she can bear of having to prepare food and sweets. Many people take this month to prepare fancy foods and drinks, and they go extremes in that. This detracts from the sweetness of this month and goes against the reason for fasting, which is to attain piety. 
16 – The month of Ramadaan is the month of the Qur’aan, so we suggest that each family gets together to read Qur’aan. The father should teach his family to recite Qur’aan and help them to understand the meanings of the verses. In the same gathering they may also read a book about the rulings and etiquette of fasting. Allaah has enabled many scholars and seekers of knowledge to write books which can be used for preaching and teaching during Ramadaan; the books are divided into thirty parts, so one topic can be read each day, and this will benefit everyone. 
17 – They should be encouraged to spend and check on their neighbours and the needy. 
It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was the most generous of people, and he was at his most generous during Ramadaan when Jibreel met him. He would meet him each night and revise the Qur’aan with him. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was more generous than the blowing wind. 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6; Muslim, 2308. 
18 – The parents should prevent their families and children from staying up late at night and wasting their time in things that are of no benefit, let alone things that are haraam. For the devils among mankind are more active in this month in promoting evil things and acts of immorality to those who are fasting, during the nights of Ramadaan and during the days. 
19 – They should remember the family’s meeting in Allaah’s Paradise in the Hereafter, and the great joy of meeting there under the shade of His throne. These blessed gatherings in this world and coming together to obey Allaah by seeking knowledge, fasting and praying are only the means that lead to attaining that happiness.",Islam Q&A

    things, then it applies even more so to things that are less severe: the person who is forced to do them is not held to account for it. 
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah has forgiven my ummah for mistakes, forgetfulness and that which they are forced to do.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 
    2033; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan Ibn Maajah, 1664. 
So if a woman who was raped did her utmost to 
    resist, but she was not able to escape, there is no sin on her; her fast is valid and she does not have to make it up or offer any kafaarah 
    (expiation). 
Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said: 
Everything that overwhelms a fasting person, 
    he does not to make it up or do anything else. Al-Mughni, 4/376. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked about a man who has intercourse with his wife when she does not want 
    to. He replied: 
… If the woman is forced to do it then there is no sin on her and her fast is still valid, but 
    if she let him do it then she has to make up that day and also repent, but she does not have to offer expiation. 
Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 
    15/310. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh 
    al-Mumti’ (6/414) on the ruling on having intercourse during the day in Ramadaan: 
If the woman is excused because of ignorance 
    or forgetfulness, or because she was forced to do it, then she does not have to make it up and she does not have to offer expiation. 
We take this opportunity to advise women to 
    fear Allaah and to avoid mixing with men, especially kaafirs and the immoral ones among them, and to keep away from everything that may attract 
    men to them of tabarruj (wanton display), soft speech and flirtatious speech and behaviour. They should choose suitable times and avoid doubtful 
    places or situations. They should adhere to the commands of Allaah and observe hijab and cover themselves, because that will protect them and is 
    good for them in this world and in the hereafter.

26844,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26844,Making Witr resemble Maghrib,"You wrote in article 'Night time praying during Ramadan' that The Prophet(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade praying witr as three rakahs, and explained this by saying: Do not make it resemble Salaat al-Maghrib. Therefore the person who wants to pray three rakahs for witr must find a way to make it different (from Maghrib). There are two ways he can do this: either by giving salaam after the first two rakahs, which is the best way; or by not sitting after the first two rakahs . 

I also pray 3 rakas of witar but i make it different from salat al maghrib by raising hands for takbir before dua e  Qanot.Is it correct?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Before answering this question, we would like 
    to say that we appreciate your eagerness to follow the Sunnah, and we ask Allaah to make us and you among those who listen to the word and follow 
    it properly.  
What you have said – may Allaah guide you – 
    about not wanting to make Witr resemble Maghrib by raising your hands for the Takbeer before reciting Du’aa’ al-Qunoot, is not what is meant by 
    the prohibition of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the hadeeth narrated by al-Haakim (1/304), al-Bayhaqi (3/31) 
    and al-Daaraqutni (p. 172), and which was classed as saheeh by al-Haakim according to the conditions of al-Bukhaari and Muslim. According to this 
    hadeeth the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do not pray Witr with three rak’ahs that resemble Maghrib.” What he 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) meant, as the scholars have explained, was that we should not sit to recite the first Tashahhud 
    in a manner that resembles Maghrib. 
See Fath al-Baari by Ibn Hajar, 4/301. 
    al-Haafiz said: Its isnaad is saheeh according to the conditions of al-Bukhaari and Muslim. See also ‘Awn al-Ma’bood, commentary on hadeeth 
    no. 1423; Salaat al-Taraaweeh by al-Albaani, p. 97. 
Raising the hands for Takbeer before reciting Du’aa’ al-Qunoot makes no difference in fact, 
    because there are four places in which the hands should be raised during prayer: 
1 – When saying Takbeer al-ihraam (takbeer 
    for starting the prayer)
2 – When bowing in rukoo’
3 – When standing up from rukoo’
4 – When standing up after the first 
    tashahhud 
It is not prescribed for the worshipper to 
    raise his hands at any point other than these four.

I feel the answer as written in that pumphlet is wrong but to certify that I would greatly value your opinion.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
This book called al-Khilaaf is not 
    known; perhaps it is one of the books of the Raafidi Shi’ah, because they have a book by this name which they claim deals with matters of dispute 
    between the Islamic sects.                                                   
The Raafidi Shi’ah would not refrain from telling lies against the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him). Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah described them as being “the worst liars among people and the worst in breaking 
    promises.” Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 28/484. And he also said in Minhaaj al-Sunnah al-Nabawiyyah (1/8) that they are the worst liars when 
    it comes to transmitting reports, and the most ignorant of people in terms of reasoning. They believe reports which the scholars know are 
    obviously false, and they reject well-known facts that have been passed down from generation to generation. With regard to the transmission of 
    knowledge and the narrators of ahaadeeth and reports, they do not differentiate between lies, mistakes and ignorance or whether the narrator is of 
    good character, has a sound memory and is known for his knowledge of the reports.  
In Minhaaj al-Sunnah (2/87) he also 
    said: “Among the people who pray towards the qiblah you will not find any more ignorant than the Raafidi Shi’ah… they are the worst liars among 
    people without a doubt… and they are the most hypocritical.” 
Secondly: 
With regard to the hadeeth you ask about, no 
    rational person would doubt that it is falsely attributed to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because how could the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) permit zina (adultery, fornication) when it is well known in Islam that it is forbidden? 
    Indeed the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade the things that may lead to zina, such as a man being alone with a 
    non-mahram woman, shaking hands with her, careless mixing between men and women, and women speaking in a soft and gentle manner, etc. 
Hence Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“And come not near to unlawful sex. 
    Verily, it is a Faahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits: a great sin, and an evil way that leads one to hell unless Allaah Forgives 
    him)”
[al-Isra’ 17:32]
Think about this: Allaah forbids us to come 
    near to zina, which is more emphatic than simply saying do not do it, because this means that all the things that lead up to it or promote it are 
    also forbidden. Tafseer al-Sa’di, p. 742. 
And Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“ And those who invoke not any other ilaah 
    (god) along with Allaah, nor kill such person as Allaah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse  and whoever does this shall 
    receive the punishment.
 The torment will be doubled to him on the 
    Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace;
Except those who repent and believe (in 
    Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds”
[al-Furqaan 25:68-70]
This abhorrent immoral action (illegal sexual intercourse) is mentioned alongside associating 
    others with Allaah and killing innocent souls, because it kills virtue, spreads evil, destroys honour, mixes lineages, and other evil consequences 
    and diseases which cause disintegration of nations and societies. 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah 
    be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When the adulterer commits adultery he 
    is not a believer.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2475; Muslim, 57. 
Al-Bukhaari narrated (7047) from Samurah ibn 
    Jundub that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, in a lengthy hadeeth in which he described different kinds of 
    punishment in the grave: “… and we went on and came to something like a tannoor oven, whose top was narrow and its base was wide, in which there 
    were screams and voices. We looked inside and saw naked men and women, to whom flames came from beneath. When those flames came to them, their 
    voices became loud and they rose up until they almost came out, then when the flames died down they went back. I said to them [the two angels], 
    ‘Who are these people?’… They said, ‘As for the naked men and women who were in something like a tannoor oven, they are the adulterers and 
    adulteresses.’” 
Ahmad (21708) narrated that Abu Umaamah said: 
    A young man came to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of Allaah, give me permission to commit 
    zina.” The people turned to him to rebuke him, saying, “Shh, shh.” (The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) said, “Come 
    here.” So he came close to him and he told him to sit down. He said, “Would you like that for your mother?” He said, “No, by Allaah, may I be 
    sacrificed for you.” He said, “Nor do people like it for their mothers.” He said, “Would you like it for your daughter?” He said, “No, by Allaah, 
    may I be sacrificed for you.” He said, “Nor do people like it for their daughters.” He said, “Would you like it for your sister?” He said, “No, by 
    Allaah, may I be sacrificed for you.” He said, “Nor do people like it for their sisters.” He said, “Would you like it for your paternal aunt?” He 
    said, “No, by Allaah, may I be sacrificed for you.” He said, “Nor do people like it for their paternal aunts.” He said, “Would you like it for 
    your maternal aunt?” He said, “No, by Allaah, may I be sacrificed for you.” He said, “Nor do people like it for their maternal aunts.” Then he 
    placed his hand on him and said, “O Allaah, forgive his sin, purify his heart, and guard his chastity.” And after that, this young man never did 
    anything. 
Al-‘Iraaqi said in Takhreej Ahaadeeth 
    al-Ihya’: Ahmad narrated this with a jayyid isnaad whose men are the men of saheeh. 
There are very many verses and saheeh hadeeth 
    which state how repugnant this crime is and which describe the fate of those who do it, in this world and in the Hereafter. So how, after all 
    that, can these ugly words be attributed to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? 
Moreover, this sinful liar says, “If this man 
    is attracted to a woman at his place of work”.
Did the companions of the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who were the best generation, have “places of work” in which men and women came together and mixed? 
The questioner and others should beware of 
    these reprehensible and immoral misconceptions, and not pay any attention to them. 
This liar who falsely attributes words to the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) indeed deserves to be included in the words of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever tells lies against me deliberately, let him take his place in Hell.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 111;

Fasting the day of doubt


Categories of fasting in the second half of Sha`ban","Praise be to Allah.Fasting in the second half of Sha`ban
There are hadiths narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which forbid fasting in the second half of Sha`ban , except in two cases: 

Those who have a habitual pattern of fasting, such as a man who usually fasts on Mondays and Thursdays – he may continue to do so even in the second half of Sha`ban. 
If he joins fasts in the second half of  Sha`ban to the first half, i.e., if he started to fast in the first half and continues to fast until Ramadan begins, this is permissible. 

These hadiths include the following: 

Al-Bukhari (1914) and Muslim (1082) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not anticipate Ramadan by fasting one or two days before it begins, but if a man habitually fasts, then let him fast.” 
Abu Dawud (3237), al-Tirmidhi (738) and Ibn Majah (1651) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Sha`ban is half over, do not fast.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 590 )

Al-Nawawi said: 
“The words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Do not anticipate Ramadan by fasting one or two days before it begins, but if a man habitually fasts, then let him fast,” clearly indicate that it is not allowed to anticipate Ramadan by fasting one or two days before it begins, for those who do not have a habitual pattern of fasting or who are not continuing to fast after starting to fast before (in the first half of Sha`ban). If one is not continuing to fast or does not have a regular pattern of fasting, then it is haram.” 
Fasting the day of doubt

Al-Tirmidhi (686) and al-Nasai (2188) narrated that ‘Ammar ibn Yasir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Whoever fasts on the day concerning which there is doubt has disobeyed Abu’l-Qasim (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” 

Al-Hafiz said in Fath al-Bari: 
“It was understood from this that it is haram to fast the day of doubt, because the Companions would not say such a thing based on personal opinion.” 
The day of doubt is the thirtieth of Sha`ban if the new moon cannot be seen because of clouds etc. It is called the day of doubt because it could be the thirtieth of Sha`ban, or it could be the first day of Ramadan. It is haram to fast on this day, unless it coincides with a day on which a person habitually fasts. 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu’ (6/400) concerning the ruling on fasting the day of doubt: 
“If a person observes a voluntary fast on this day, and he has a reason for doing so, such as having the habit of fasting every day, or of fasting alternate days, or fasting on particular days such as Mondays, and it happens to coincide with that day, then it is permissible for him to fast on this day; there is no difference of opinion among our companions regarding that. The evidence for that is the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: “Do not anticipate Ramadan by fasting one or two days before it begins, but if a man habitually fasts, then let him fast.” If he does not have a reason, then it is haram for him to fast on this day.” 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said in his commentary on the hadith “Do not anticipate Ramadan by fasting one or two days before it begins…”: 
“The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differed concerning this prohibition and whether it meant that this is haram or makruh. The correct view is that it means it is haram, especially on the day of doubt.”  (Sharh Riyad al-Salihin, 3/394) 
Categories of fasting in the second half of Sha`ban 
Based on this, fasting in the second half of Sha`ban falls into two categories: 

Fasting from the sixteenth until the twenty-eighth. This is makruh, except for those who have a habitual pattern of fasting.
Fasting on the day of doubt, or one or two days before Ramadan begins. This is haram, except for one who has a habitual pattern of fasting.

    conditions of marriage is the consent of both parties, because of the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) which says that the Prophet said: “A virgin cannot be married until her consent has been sought and a previously-married woman cannot be married until she has 
    been consulted.” They said, “O Messenger of Allaah, what is her consent?” He said, “If she remains silent.” 
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5136; Muslim, 
    1419) 
Consent is essential in the case of the 
    husband, and also in the case of the wife. The parents have no right to force their son or their daughter to marry someone they do not want. 
But if the person whom the parents have 
    chosen is righteous, then the child, whether male or female, should obey the parents in that, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “If there comes to you one with whose religious commitment and character you are pleased, then marry (your daughter) to 
    him.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1084; Ibn Maajah, 1967. Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 865). 
But if obeying them will lead to divorce 
    later on, then the child does not have to obey them in that, because consent is the foundation of the marital relationship, and this consent must 
    be in accordance with sharee’ah, which is approval of the one who is religiously committed and of good character. 
Shaykh Dr. Khaalid al-Mushayqih 
A child is not considered to be disobedient 
    or sinful if he does not obey his parents in this regard. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
The parents do not have the right to force 
    their child to marry someone whom he does not want, and if he refuses he is not being disobedient towards them, as is the case when he does not 
    eat what he does not want.

Yes, it is permissible to make up missed Ramadan fasts on the day of doubt and one or two days before Ramadan. 
It was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade fasting the day of doubt, and he forbade anticipating Ramadan by fasting one or two days before it begins, but this prohibition does not apply to a person who has a habitual pattern of fasting, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not anticipate Ramadan by fasting one or two days before it begins, but if a man habitually fasts, then let him fast.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1914; Muslim, 1082)
So if a person is used to fasting on Mondays , for example, and that coincides with the last day of Sha’ban, then it is permissible for him to observe that as a voluntary fast and it is not forbidden for him to do so. 
If it is permissible to observe a voluntary fast that one does regularly, then it is more appropriate that it should be permissible to make up a missed Ramadan fast, because that is obligatory, and because it is not permissible to delay making up missed fasts until after the following Ramadan. 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu’, 6/399: 
“Our companions said: It is not correct to fast on the day of doubt when it is uncertain that Ramadan has begun, and there is no difference of scholarly opinion on this point… But if a person fasts it to make up for a missed fast , or in fulfillment of a vow, or as an act of expiation (kaffarah), then it is permissible, because if it is permissible to observe a voluntary fast on that day for one who has a reason to do so, then it is more appropriate that one should be allowed to observe an obligatory fast.  This is like the time when it is forbidden to pray (when one may nevertheless offer a prayer for which there is a reason). And if a person still owes some missed Ramadan fasts, then he has to observe those fasts, because the time for making it up has become very short.”

The word Hakeem is derived from the same root as hukm (ruling) and hikmah (wisdom). Allah alone is the One Who issues rulings, and His rulings are the most wise and perfect. 
Secondly: 
Allah does not prescribe any ruling but there is great wisdom behind it, which we may understand, or our minds may not be guided to understand it. We may know some of it but a great deal is hidden from us. 
Thirdly: 
Allah has mentioned the reason and wisdom behind His enjoining of fasting upon us, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)” [Al-Baqarah 2:183]
Fasting is a means of attaining taqwa (piety, being conscious of Allah), and taqwa means doing that which Allah has enjoined and avoiding that which He has forbidden. 
Fasting is one of the greatest means of helping a person to fulfil the commands of Islam.
 The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) have mentioned some of the reasons why fasting is prescribed, all of which are characteristics of taqwa, but there is nothing wrong with quoting them here, to draw the attention of fasting people to them and make them keen to attain them. 
Among the reasons behind fasting are: 
1 – Fasting is a means that makes us appreciate and give thanks for pleasures. For fasting means giving up eating, drinking and intercourse, which are among the greatest pleasures. By giving them up for a short time, we begin to appreciate their value. Because the blessings of Allah are not recognized, but when you abstain from them, you begin to recognize them, so this motivates you to be grateful for them.
 2 – Fasting is a means of giving up haraam things, because if a person can give up halaal things in order to please Allah and for fear of His painful torment, then he will be more likely to refrain from haraam things. So fasting is a means of avoiding the things that Allah has forbidden. 
3 – Fasting enables us to control our desires, because when a person is full his desires grow, but if he is hungry then his desire becomes weak. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O young men! Whoever among you can afford to get married, let him do so, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and protecting one’s chastity. Whoever cannot do that, let him fast, for it will be a shield for him.” 
4 – Fasting makes us feel compassion and empathy towards the poor, because when the fasting person tastes the pain of hunger for a while, he remembers those who are in this situation all the time, so he will hasten to do acts of kindness to them and show compassion towards them. So fasting is a means of feeling empathy with the poor.
 5 – Fasting humiliates and weakens the Shaytaan; it weakens the effects of his whispers (waswaas) on a person and reduces his sins. That is because the Shaytaan “flows through the son of Adam like blood” as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, but fasting narrows the passages through which the Shaytaan flows, so his influence grows less. 
Shaykh al-Islam said in Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 25/246 
Undoubtedly blood is created from food and drink, so when a person eats and drinks, the passages through which the devils flow – which is the blood – become wide. But if a person fasts, the passages through which the devils flow become narrow, so hearts are motivated to do good deeds, and to give up evil deeds. 
6 – The fasting person is training himself to remember that Allah is always watching, so he gives up the things that he desires even though he is able to take them, because he knows that Allah can see him. 
7 – Fasting means developing an attitude of asceticism towards this world and its desires, and seeking that which is with Allah. 
8 – It makes the Muslim get used to doing a great deal of acts of worship, because the fasting person usually does more acts of worship and gets used to that.  
These are some of the reasons why fasting is enjoined. We ask Allah to help us to achieve them and to worship Him properly. 
And Allah knows best.

It is essential to make the intention to fast the month of Ramadan at night before Fajr. It is not sufficient to start fasting it that day without the intention. Whoever finds out at the time of Duha that today is Ramadan and makes the intention of fasting has to refrain from eating until sunset, and he also has to make up that day.

Can I make an intention for voluntary fasting on the same day?
This is with regard to obligatory fasts. With regard to nafl fasts , it is permissible to make the intention to fast on the day, if you have not eaten or drunk or had intercourse after Fajr, because it was proven in the hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered upon her one day at Duha time and said, “Do you have anything (any food)?” She said, “No.” He said, “Then I am fasting.”  (Narrated by Muslim)

Scenarios of delaying making up missed fasts until next Ramadan


Delaying making up fasts until next Ramadan: Is fidyah a  must?","Praise be to Allah.Obligation to make up missed fasts before next Ramadan 
The imams are agreed that whoever does not fast some days of Ramadan has to make up those days before the next Ramadan comes . 
They quoted as evidence for that the hadith narrated by al-Bukhari (1950) and Muslim (1146) from ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: “I used to have fasts that I still owed from Ramadan, and I could not make them up until Sha’ban, and that was because of the position of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) [as a husband].” 
Al-Hafiz said: 
“It may be understood from her keenness to fast them in Sha’ban that it is not permissible to delay making up fasts until the next Ramadan begins.” 
Scenarios of delaying making up missed fasts until next Ramadan
If a person delays making up fasts until Ramadan begins, one of the following two scenarios must apply.  

The delay is for a reason, such as being sick and the sickness lasting until the following Ramadan begins. There is no sin on a person for delaying in this case, because he has an excuse, and he only has to make up for the days missed. So he should make up the number of days that he did not fast. 
There is no reason for the delay, such as when a person was able to make up the fasts but he did not do so before the following Ramadan began. 

This person is sinning by failing to make up the fasts with no excuse. 
Delaying making up fasts until next Ramadan: Is fidyah a  must?
The imams are agreed that he must make up the fasts, but they differed as to whether along with making up the fasts he must also feed one poor person for each day or not. 
Malik, al-Shaf’i and Ahmad said that he must feed a poor person , and they quoted as evidence for that the reports narrated from some of the Sahabah such as Abu Hurayrah and Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them). 
Imam Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him) was of the view that he does not have to feed a poor person as well as making up the fasts. 
He quoted as evidence the fact that Allah commands the one who does not fast in Ramadan only to make up the missed fasts , and He did not mention feeding a poor person . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days.” [al-Baqarah 2:185] (See al-Majmu’, 6/366; al-Mughni, 4/400)
This second view was also favoured by Imam al-Bukhari (may Allaah have mercy on him). He said in his Sahih: 
Ibrahim (i.e., al-Nakha’i) said: If a person neglects (to make up missed fasts) until the next Ramadan comes, he should fast the missed days of both months. But he did not think that he has to feed a poor person. There was also a mursal report from Abu Hurayrah and Ibn 'Abbas which says that he should also feed a poor person. Then al-Bukhari said: But Allah does not mention feeding a poor person, rather He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“…the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days.” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said, when noting that it is not obligatory to feed a poor person: 
“With regard to the words of the Sahabah, their use as evidence is subject to further discussion if it goes against the apparent meaning of the Quran. In this case, saying that it is obligatory to feed a poor person goes against the apparent meaning of the Quran, because Allah only enjoined making up the same number from other days, and He did not mention more than that. Based on this, we should not oblige the slaves of Allah to do any more than they need to fulfil their duty. But what was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas and Abu Hurayrah may be interpreted as referring to what is mustahabb, not what is obligatory. The correct view with regard to this issue is that a person does not have to do anything more than making up the missed fasts, but he is sinning if he delays doing so.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/451) 
Based on this, then what is obligatory is to make up the fasts only, but if a person wants to be on the safe side and feed one poor person for each day missed, then that is good. 
The woman who asked this question – if she delayed making up the fasts with no excuse, has to repent to Allah and resolve not to repeat this mistake in the future.

Expiation for breaking fast intentionally","Praise be to Allah.Breaking fast intentionally
If this lady did not fast three days of Ramadan out of heedlessness and not because she believed it was permissible to do so, then she has committed a serious major sin by violating the sanctity of Ramadan. Fasting Ramadan is one of the pillars of Islam . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqun (the pious).
[Observing Sawm (fasts)] for a fixed number of days, but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days. And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskin (poor person) (for every day). But whoever does good of his own accord, it is better for him. And that you fast is better for you if only you know.
The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong). So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Sawm (fasts) that month.” [al-Baqarah 2:183-185]
Expiation for breaking fast intentionally
So she must fast three days to make up for those days when she did not fast. If she had intercourse during the day on those three days when she did not fast, she must also offer expiation (kaffarah) for that day as well as making up the fast. If she had intercourse on two days then she must offer two expiations, as well as making up two days. 
The expiation is to free a slave; if that is not possible then she must fast for two consecutive months; if she is unable to do that then she must feed sixty poor persons from the local staple food . She must also seek the forgiveness of Allah and repent to Him; she must observe the fasts that Allah has enjoined on her and sincerely resolve not to break her fast in Ramadan again. She must also feed one poor person for each of the three days because of her delay in making up the fasts until after the following Ramadan .

26869,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26869,Suggested program for the Muslim during Ramadan,"Firstly, let me congratulate you on the beginning of the blessed month of Ramadan; I hope that Allah will accept fasting and prayers from us and from you.
I hope that I can make the most of this opportunity to do as much worship and earn as much reward as possible. I hope that you could give me a program that is suitable for me and my family so that we can make the most of this month in goodness and obedience.",,,"Praise be to Allah.May Allah accept all our righteous words and deeds, and help us to be sincere in secret and in public. 
There follows a suggested program for the Muslim during this blessed month: 
The Muslim’s day in Ramadan: 
The Muslim starts his day with suhoor before Fajr prayer. It is better to delay suhoor until the latest possible time of the night. 
Then after that the Muslim gets ready for Fajr prayer before the adhan. So he does Wudu at home and goes out to the mosque before the adhan. 
When he enters the mosque, he prays two rak’ahs (tahiyyat al-masjid – greeting the mosque). Then he sits and keeps busy making du`a, or reading Quran, or reciting dhikr, until the muezzin gives the call to prayer. He repeats what the muezzin says, and says the du`a narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to be said after the adhan ends. Then after that he prays two rak’ahs (the regular Sunnah of Fajr), then he occupies himself with du`a and reading Quran until the iqaamah for prayer is given. He is in a state of prayer so long as he is waiting for the prayer. 
After offering the prayer in congregation, he recites the dhikrs that are prescribed following the salaam at the end of the prayer. After that if he wants to sit in the mosque until the sun has risen, reciting dhikr and reading Quran, that is preferable, and that is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do after Fajr prayer. 
Then about one-quarter of an hour after the sun has risen, if he wants he can pray Duha prayer (a minimum of two rak’ahs), and that is good. Or if he wants he can delay it until the preferred time, which is when the day has grown hotter and the sun is higher in the sky – that is better. 
Then if he wants he may sleep to prepare himself for going to work, and he can intend by sleeping to strengthen himself for worship and earning a living, so that he will be rewarded for it in sha Allah. He should also follow the etiquette of sleep that is prescribed in sharee’ah, both actions and words. 
Then he goes to work, and when the time for Zuhr prayer comes, he goes to the mosque early, before the adhan or immediately after it, and he should get ready to pray beforehand. So he prays four rak’ahs with two tasleems (the regular Sunnah before Zuhr), then he keeps busy reading Quran until the iqaamah for prayer is given, and he prays with the congregation, then he prays two rak’ahs (the regular Sunnah after Zuhr). 
Then after the prayer he goes and finishes whatever of his work is left, until it is time to leave work. If there is a long time to go after finishing his work until the time for ‘Asr prayer, then he can rest. But if there is not enough time and he fears that if he sleeps he will miss ‘Asr prayer, then he should keep busy doing something suitable until the time for ‘Asr comes, such as going to the market to buy some things that his family needs and the like, or going straight to the mosque when he has finished his work, and staying in the mosque until he has prayed ‘Asr. 
Then after ‘Asr, it depends on his circumstances. If he can stay in the mosque and keep busy reading Quran, this is a great opportunity. But if he feels tired, then he should rest at this time so that he will be ready to pray taraaweeh at night. 
Before the adhan for Maghrib, he should get ready to break his fast, and he should do something at this time that will benefit him, whether reading Quran, making du`a, or having a useful conversation with his wife and children. 
One of the best things that he can do at this time is to take part in offering iftaar to those who are fasting, whether by bringing food to them or helping to distribute it to them and organizing that. This brings a great joy which no one knows except those who have experienced it. 
After iftaar, he goes and prays in congregation in the mosque, and after the prayer he prays two rak'ahs (the regular Sunnah of Maghrib). Then he goes back home and eats whatever is available – without eating too much. Then he looks for a suitable way for himself and his family to spend this time, whether reading a book of stories, or a book on practical rulings, or a quiz, or permissible conversation, or any other useful idea that is of interest to the members of the family and will distract them from the haraam things that appear in the media which regard this as their prime time, so you find the media transmitting their most attractive programs at that time, that may contain immoral and obscene material. Strive to turn away from that, and fear Allah with regard to your “flock” (i.e., your family) concerning whom you will be questioned on the Day of Resurrection, so be prepared to answer the questions. 
Then get ready for ‘Isha’ prayer, go to the mosque and keep busy reading Quran or listening to the lesson being given in the mosque. 
Then after that perform ‘Isha’ prayer, then pray two rak’ahs (the regular Sunnah of ‘Isha’), then pray taraaweeh behind the imam with humility and focus, pondering the meanings of what is recited. Do not finish until the imam finishes. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever stands (and prays) with the imam until he finishes, it will be recorded as if he spent the night in prayer.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1370, and others. Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Salaat al-Taraaweeh, p. 15. 
Then after Taraaweeh you can make a program for yourself that is suited to your circumstances and personal commitments. But you should pay attention to the following: 
Keeping away from all haraam things and whatever may lead to them. 
Paying attention to ensuring that your family avoid falling into any haraam thing or whatever may lead to that, in a wise manner, such as preparing a program just for them, or taking them out for leisure trips to permissible places, or keeping them away from bad friends, or looking for good friends for them. 
Keeping busy with things that take priority. 
Then you should try to sleep early, whilst paying attention to the etiquette of sleep as prescribed in sharee’ah, both actions and words. If you read some Quran or some beneficial books before going to sleep, that is something good, especially if you have not yet completed your daily portion of Quran – so do not go to sleep until you have completed it. 
Then wake up before suhoor, allowing enough time to recite du`a, because this time – the last third of the night – is the time when Allah descends, and Allah has praised those who seek His forgiveness at this time, and has promised those who call upon Him at this time that He will answer them, and that He will accept the repentance of those who repent to Him at this time. So do not neglect this great opportunity. 
Friday: 
Friday is the best day of the week, so you should have a special program of worship on this day, in which you pay attention to the following: 
Coming early to Jumu’ah prayer. 
Staying in the mosque after ‘Asr prayer, and keeping busy with reading Quran and making du`a until the last hour of this day, for that is a time when du`as are answered. 
Make this day an opportunity for completing some of your deeds that you did not finish during the week, such as completing your weekly portion of Quran, or finishing reading a book or listening to a tape and other good deeds. 
The last ten days of Ramadan: 
The last ten days of Ramadan include Laylat al-Qadr which is better than a thousand months. Hence it is prescribed for a person to observe i’tikaaf (“retreat” for the purpose of worship) in the mosque during these ten days, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do, seeking Laylat al-Qadr. Whoever can observe i’tikaaf at this time, this is a great blessing from Allah. 
Whoever cannot observe i’tikaaf for the entire period should do as much as he is able to. 
If he is not able to do i’tikaaf at all, then he should try to spend the nights in worship. Praying qiyam, reading Quran, remembering Allah and making du`a. He should prepare for that by resting during the day so that he will be able to stay up at night. 
Note: 
This program is just a suggestion. It is a flexible schedule that each person can adapt to his own circumstances. 
This program pays attention to the Sunnahs that are proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It does not mean that everything mentioned here is an obligatory duty, rather it includes many things that are Sunnah and mustahabb. 
The most beloved of actions to Allah are those which are continuous even if they are little. At the beginning of the month a person may be keen to do acts of worship, then he may slow down. Beware of that, and strive to persist in all the actions that you do in this blessed month. 
The Muslim should strive to organize his time in this blessed month so that he will not miss out on a great opportunity to do more good and righteous deeds. For example, a person should try to buy all the things that the family needs before the month begins, and he should buy day-to-day needs at times when the stores are not crowded, and visits to friends and family should be organized in such a way that they do not distract from acts of worship. 
Make doing lots of acts of worship and drawing closer to Allah your priority in this blessed month. 
Resolve at the beginning of the month to go to the mosque early at the times of prayer, and to complete the Book of Allah, and to regularly pray qiyam al-layl in this great month, and to spend (in charity) what you can of your wealth. 
Make the most of the opportunity that the month of Ramadan brings to strengthen your connection to the Book of Allah, by utilizing the following means:
 Read the verses correctly. The way to do that is to have your reading corrected by someone who knows how to read well. If you cannot do that, then by listening to tapes of expert readers. 
Revise what Allah has enabled you to memorize, and memorize some more. 
Read the tafseer (commentary) on the verses, either by looking up the verses you do not understand in reliable books of tafseer such as Tafseer al-Baghawi and Tafseer Ibn Katheer and Tafseer al-Sa’di, or by making a program to read a book of tafseer. Start first with the thirtieth Juz’ (section) of the Quran, then mover on to the twenty-ninth juz’, and so on. 
Strive to apply the commands that you read in the Book of Allah.

Importance of making du’a in Ramadan","Praise be to Allah.Du’a for breaking fast: (Dhahaba al-zama…)
‘Umar said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say when breaking his fast: “Dhahaba al-zama wa’btalat al-‘uruq wa thabata al-ajr in sha Allah (Thirst is gone, the veins are moistened and the reward is certain if Allah wills).” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 2357; al-Daraqutni, 25. Ibn Hajar said in al-Talkhis al-Habir (2/202): al-Daraqutni said, its isnad is sahih.)
Allahumma laka sumtu…: Is this dua for breaking fast authentic?
The du’a “Allahumma laka sumtu wa ‘ala rizqika aftartu (O Allah, for You have I fasted and by Your provision I have broken my fast)” was narrated by Abu Dawud, 2358. It is a mursal hadith so it is da’if (weak). Al-Albani classed it as da’if in Da’if Abi Dawud  (510) 
Du’a after acts of worship
Saying du’a after doing acts of worship is deeply rooted in the Shari’ah, such as making du’a after praying and after completing the rituals of Hajj. Fasting is not excluded from that in sha Allah. Allah mentioned the verse of du’a and encouraged du’a among the verses that speak of fasting, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright.” [al-Baqarah 2:186]
Importance of making du’a in Ramadan 
Pointing out the importance of making du’a during Ramadan, Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
“Allah tells us that He is close to His slaves and responds to the supplication (du’a) of the one who calls upon Him. Here He is telling us of His Lordship (rububiyyah) over them and that He gives them what they ask for and He responds to their du’a. For if they call upon Him that means they believe that He is their Lord… Then He enjoins two things upon them, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright.” [al-Baqarah 2:186]
The first is that they should obey His commands to worship Him and seek His help. 
The second is that they should believe in His Lordship (rububiyyah) and Divinity (uluhiyyah), and that He is their Lord and their God. Hence it is said that response to a person’s du’a is indicative of the soundness of his belief and the perfection of his obedience, because the verse of du’a ends with the words (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright.” [al-Baqarah 2:186] (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 14/33)

    good and proper without a correct religion to give life and that this human 
    soul cannot be stable without a proper relationship with its creator, 
    Allaah. Worship of Allaah is the spirit of life, without which there can be 
    nothing but hardship and misery. 

    With regard to your question about your getting married to a 
    Muslim, if you embrace Islam and accept it as your religion – and this is 
    what we ask Allaah to help you to do – then there is nothing to stop you 
    from marrying him. Your guardian for the purpose of marriage should be your 
    closest Muslim relative; if you have no Muslim relatives then your guardian 
    should be the Muslim judge (qaadi) in the city in which you are living, or 
    someone who is responsible for the Muslim community if there is no Muslim 
    qaadi or sharee’ah court. 

    You should note that Islamic law (sharee’ah) forbids a Muslim 
    woman to marry a non-Muslim man, no matter what his religion is, and it 
    forbids a Muslim man to marry any non-Muslim woman apart from women of the 
    People of the Book, namely Jews and Christians; no others are allowed. 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And do not marry Al-Mushrikaat (idolatresses) till they 
    believe (worship Allaah Alone). And indeed a slave woman who believes is 
    better than a (free) Mushrikah (idolatress), even though she pleases you. 
    And give not (your daughters) in marriage to Al-Mushrikoon till they believe 
    (in Allaah Alone) and verily, a believing slave is better than a (free) 
    Mushrik (idolater), even though he pleases you. Those (Al-Mushrikoon) invite 
    you to the Fire, but Allaah invites (you) to Paradise and forgiveness by His 
    Leave, and makes His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, 
    revelations, etc.) clear to mankind that they may remember”

    [al-Baqarah 2:221]
This verse makes clear 
    the great wisdom behind this prohibition, which is to protect Muslim men and 
    women from being influenced in religious matters. But because the man is the 
    one who has the final say in the household, he is less likely to be 
    influenced by his wife than in the opposite situation, hence he is permitted 
    to marry a woman from among the People of the Book only [not from other 
    religions], because their disbelief is less serious than that of others, in 
    general, and because they are followers of a previous divine message, even 
    though it has been distorted, so they are different from others. On this 
    basis, it is not permissible for a Muslim to marry a Sikh woman unless she 
    becomes Muslim.

     Our advice to you, to which we hope Allaah will open your 
    heart, is that so long as this issue exists, you should make the most of it 
    so that it will be a motive for you to enter Islam, especially since this 
    Muslim man is following his religion. We hope that if you become Muslim, you 
    and he will be able to help one another to be patient and steadfast, because 
    after you become Muslim you will need someone to stand by your side and 
    protect you from those who will not like the fact that you have become 
    Muslim and have left the religion of your forefathers. This is how Allaah 
    tests many of those who enter this pure monotheistic religion, so that it 
    may be a motive for them to remain steadfast, and to show in reality whether 
    they deserve this blessing or not. We ask Allaah to help you find the way to 
    true happiness and to believe in it and adhere steadfastly to it, until it 
    ultimately leads to Paradise as vast as the heavens and the earth. Please 
    also see question no. 3023. Peace be upon those who follow true guidance.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Ash-hadu an la ilaha ill-Allah wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan ‘abduhu wa rasuluh (All compliments, prayers and pure words are due to Allah. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of Allah and His blessings. Peace be upon us and upon the righteous slaves of Allah. I bear witness that there is no god except Allah and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger). ((al-Bukhari, 831; Muslim, 402)  
Then after that he should send blessings upon the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and say:  
“Allahumma salli ‘ala Muhammad wa ‘ala ali Muhammad kama salayta ‘ala Ibrahim wa ‘ala ali Ibrahim , innaka hamidun majid. Allahumma barik ‘ala Muhammad wa ‘ala ali Muhammad kama barakta ‘ala Ibrahim wa ‘ala ali Ibrahim, innaka hamidun majid (O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent prayers upon Ibrahim and the family of Ibrahim, You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory. O Allah, bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as You blessed Ibrahim and the family of Ibrahim, You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory). (Al-Bukhari, 3370; Muslim, 406)  
Then he should recite the following du’a:
Allahumma inni a’udhu bika min ‘adhabi jahannam wa a’udhu bika min ‘adhab il-qabr, wa a’udhu bika min fitnat il-masih il-dajjal, wa a’udhu bika min fitnat il-mahya wa’l-mamat wa a’udhu bika min al-matham wa’l-maghram (O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the torment of Hell, and I seek refuge in You from the torment of the grave, and I seek refuge in You from the tribulation of the Dajjal, and I seek refuge in You from the trials of life and death, and I seek refuge in You from falling into sin and debt.) (Al-Bukhari, 833; Muslim, 588) 
Then after that he may make du’a as he likes , asking for good in this world and in the Hereafter. And if he recites some of the du’as narrated in the Sunnah, that is better.

26898,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26898,Husband’s parents preventing the wife from visiting her own family,Do the in-laws have the right to not send their daughter-in-law to her parents so that she can spend her time with her parents & all & can relax for some time in her parent's home.,,,"Praise be to Allah.What the wife is obliged to do is to obey her 
    husband; he is the one whom she is obliged to obey. If the husband agrees that she may visit her family, it does not matter if his parents do not 
    approve. 
But a woman should strive to please her 
    husband’s parents and treat them in a manner that is better, and not confront them. This will have a great effect on giving stability to her life 
    with her husband. 
You should understand that your husband’s 
    parents may make things difficult for you because they think that you have taken away the one who is most dear to them. So you should handle this 
    matter wisely and not be the cause of arguments or division between your husband and his parents. Rather you should try to help your husband obey 
    and honour his parents, and you will find the effects of that, in sha Allah, in your own children [i.e., they will honour you in turn]. 
You have to treat them kindly, because 
    kindness is never to be found in a thing but it beautifies it, and it is never lacking in a thing but it makes it ugly. If you see that they are 
    treating you badly, then remember the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Repel (the evil) with one which is better 
    (i.e. Allah orders the faithful believers to be patient at the time of anger, and to excuse those who treat them badly) then verily he, between 
    whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend”
