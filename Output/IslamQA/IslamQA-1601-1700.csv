I pray that Allah grant your Tech. by his mercy. Still he in sha;a Allah got the reward of this valuable home page.
Please, visit the following web-site,
XXXX it is concerning Hilal sighting and calculation, they claimed that in XXXX they never sight the moon and every thing run according to astronomy calculations.
My question, Is this information is right or worng, and what is the real authentic way to decied the begining of Hajrii moneth?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Islam is easy and its rules apply to everyone, mankind and jinn alike, regardless of whether they are scholars or illiterate, settled or nomadic. So Allaah made it easy for them to know the times for the acts of worship, and made their beginning and end signs which everyone can know. He made the setting of the sun the sign for the beginning of Maghrib and the end of ‘Asr, and He made the disappearance of the red glow in the sky the sign of the beginning of the time of ‘Isha’. He made the sighting of the moon after its disappearance at the end of the month the sign of the beginning of the new lunar month and the end of the previous month. He did not give us the task of knowing the beginning of the lunar month from something which is known to only a small number of people, namely astronomy and its calculations. Thus the texts of the Qur’aan and Sunnah make the actual sighting of the new moon the signal for the Muslims to start fasting Ramadaan; they stop fasting when they see the new moon of Shawwaal; the dates of Eid al-Adhaa and Yawm ‘Arafaat are similarly determined. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“… So whoever among you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadaan), he must observe sawm (fast) that month…” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
“They ask you (O Muhammad) about the new moons. Say: these are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage…” [al-Baqarah 2:189]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it, and if it is cloudy then complete the month with thirty days.”
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made the beginning of the fast conditional upon the confirmed sighting of the new moon of Ramadaan, and the ending of the fast conditional upon the confirmed sighting of the new moon of Shawwaal; he did not connect this to calculations of the movements of stars or other heavenly bodies. This is how it was done at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), during the rule of the Khulafa’ al-Raashidoon, at the time of the four imaams, and during the three centuries which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said were the best. Referring to calculations of the lunar months to start and end periods of worship, instead of actually sighting the new moon, is a bid’ah (reprehensible innovation) that has no good in it and has no basis in sharee’ah. The best of all is to follow the salaf in religious matters, and the worst of all is to follow newly-invented innovations in religion. May Allaah protect us and you and all the Muslims from tribulation, both obvious and hidden.","Fataawaa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 10/106"

1608,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1608,"Ruling on visiting
    zoos","What is the ruling on visiting zoos with
      the aim of enjoying looking at the animals?",,,"Praise be to Allah.On the basis of the opinion that it is permissible to
    keep animals in cages, visiting places designed for the purpose of displaying these
    animals to the public such as those known nowadays as zoos, for the purpose of enjoying
    looking at the different types of animals, is permissible.
It is no exaggeration to say that doing so is in fact mustahabb and
    encouraged, when the motive for this is to think about the creation of Allaah and His
    Signs by looking at these animals and finding out about their different ways of life and
    so on. This has a good effect on a person’s heart, namely it strengthens his faith in
    his Lord and in His exalted attributes, for example, His Power, Ability and Wisdom.
When we understand the good effects of visits to these zoos, the wisdom
    behind the Qur’aan’s call to think about the greatness and majesty of creation
    will become clear. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Do they not look in the dominion of the heavens and the earth
    and all things that Allaah has created…?” [al-A’raaf 7:185].
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
    “Think about the signs of Allaah, do not think about Allaah.” (Reported
    by al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu’ab, 1/136 and by al-Laalakaa’i in al-Sunnah,
    3/525. See al-Saheehah, 4/395).
    But we should not omit to note here the many wrong
    things that happen in zoos, such as mixing of men and women. Even in places where some
    days are set aside just for men to visit and other days just for women, there may be some
    women wearing types of clothing that it is not even permissible for them to wear in front
    of other women. We must therefore prepare da’wah programs to be carried out in these
    places so that we may fulfil our duty of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is
    evil, thus making sure that there is no room in these places for license and things that
    go against Islam. With regard to zoos in countries where it is not possible to achieve
    this kind of reform, Muslims should choose the most suitable time to take their children
    to the zoo; they should avoid places of evil and protect themselves and their children
    from seeing anything that could adversely affect their faith. And Allaah is the Source of
    Strength.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

      question:
I have a boy-friend who is originally from XXX,
   so he is a muslim. He now lives in the XXX and I live inXXX. I am a christian.He has asked me to marry him and I have agreed. The problem is .... his family. They have arranged a future wife for him, but he does notwish to marry
      her. But out of respect for his father he will anyway, unles I become a muslim.Then he HOPES his father will agree to our marriage.Once I knew this, I asked him, what his family would do if they found out
      he intends to marry a European girl.He could not really answer that question. Now my question is: Do you have any idea how the family might react, and
      is it likely that the father would agree if I am a muslim?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is difficult to say what their reaction will be. Most parents want
    their children to marry in accordance with their wishes, and in most cases they will have
    chosen a wife for their son from their own country, whose customs and tradition are closer
    to those of the society in which they live. The idea of their son marrying a western woman
    may be very strange for them and difficult to accept, especially if they have heard about
    the widespread promiscuity in the West and the freedom with which Western women enter into
    relationships. They may also want their son to be near them, and they may be afraid that
    if he marries someone overseas they will only see him rarely. They may warn him about the
    consequences of raising his future children in a non-Islamic environment. On the other
    hand, they might agree if they hear that their son is going to marry a decent, upright
    Muslim girl, especially if their son is going to stay on and work in the West after
    completing his studies, and if they give any weight to their son’s own wishes –
    which is a matter that differs from family to family.
Whatever the case, you will not lose anything by entering Islam, whether
    you marry this man or not. If you become Muslim and marry this man, after you both repent
    from the forbidden relationship, then you will have got what you wanted. If this marriage
    is not destined for you, then maybe Allaah will send you another good, clean Muslim man
    whom you can marry and be happy with. The most important thing here is that you understand
    that striving to please Allaah by following His religion is more important than all other
    considerations. In any case, we hope that you will become Muslim and that your hopes will
    be realized in accordance with the laws of Allaah. Thank you for your trust and your

1665,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1665,Is Marriage Compulsory in Islam?,Is it obligatory for a woman to get married?,"Marriage is obligatory for a woman who is unable to feed or clothe herself unless she gets married or she fears falling into immoral acts if she does not marry. What a woman can do to fulfill this obligation is not to refuse marriage when a suitable, compatible man comes with an offer of marriage.","When does marriage become obligatory?


Status of marriage in Islam


Benefits of marriage","Praise be to Allah.When does marriage become obligatory?
In response to your question, we will look briefly at what some of the Muslim jurists have written on this topic. In Mawahib al-Jaleel it was said: 
“Marriage is obligatory for a woman who is unable to feed or clothe herself unless she gets married.” 
In al-Sharh al-Kabir, concerning obligatory marriage it says: 
“If a person fears that he may commit fornication, it (marriage) is obligatory on him.” In Fath al-Wahhab, it says: “For the woman who has (physical) desires, marriage is sunnah, just as it is for the one who needs maintenance and the one who fears being taken advantage of by immoral persons.”
In Mughni al-Muhtaj, it says: 
“(Marriage) becomes wajib (obligatory) if a person fears fornication… And it was said that it becomes obligatory if a person has made a vow (nadhr) to get married.” Then concerning the ruling with regard to women: “If she needs to get married, i.e., she has physical desires, or needs maintenance, or she is afraid that immoral people may take advantage of her… it is preferable (mustahabb) for her to get married, because this will protect her religion and her chastity, and she can enjoy what her husband spends on her, and other advantages.”
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book al-Mughni: 
“Our colleagues differed as to whether marriage is obligatory. The best-known opinion in our madhhab is that it is not obligatory, except when a person is afraid of committing a forbidden deed if he does not marry. In that case he should make himself chaste (i.e. get married). This is the opinion of the majority of fuqaha.”
When it comes to marriage, people are of three types, one of which is those who fear that they may commit forbidden deeds if they do not get married. It is obligatory for such people to get married, according to the majority of jurists, because it is obligatory for them to make themselves chaste and protect themselves from haram. 
In Subul al-Salam it says: 
“Ibn Daqiq al-‘Eid said that some of the jurists said that marriage is obligatory for the one who fears sin or hardship (because of suppressing physical desires) and is able to marry… and it is obligatory for the one who cannot avoid fornication unless he gets married.”
In Badai’ al-Sanai’, it says: 
“There is no dispute that marriage is an obligation when desire is strong. If a person has such a strong desire for women that he cannot be patient, and he can afford to pay the mahr (dowry) and support a wife, then if he does not get married, he is a sinner.”
From the above discussion, we can see a number of situations in which marriage is obligatory. You might ask: “How can we imagine a woman fulfilling this obligation when usually it is the man who goes around knocking on doors looking for a partner? This is not the woman’s role.” The answer is: what a woman can do to fulfill this command is not to refuse marriage when a suitable, compatible man comes with an offer of marriage.
Status of marriage in Islam
Muslim women and men need to understand the high status which marriage has in Islam, so that they will be more keen to marry. There follows a useful summary on this topic by al-Imam Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi (may Allah have mercy on him), from his book al-Mughni:
“The basis of the legislation of marriage is the Quran, Sunnah and ijma’ (consensus of the scholars). In the Quran, Allah says (interpretation of the meanings): 
‘… marry women of your choice, two or three, or four…’ [al-Nisa 4:3] 
and 
‘And marry those among you who are single and (also marry) the salihun (pious, fit and capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid-servants (female slaves)…’ [al-Nur 24:32]. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O young men! Whoever among you can afford it, let him get married, for this will lower his gaze and protect his chastity. Whoever cannot (get married), then let him fast, for fasting will be a protection for him.”(Agreed upon). 
There are many other verses and reports like these. The Muslims agree that marriage is legislated.
Ibn Mas’ud said:
“If I only had ten days left to live, and I knew that I would die at the end of them, and I was able to get married, I would do so, for fear of fitnah (temptation).”
Ibn 'Abbas said to Sa’id ibn Jubayr: 
“Get married, for the best of this ummah are those who have more wives.” 
Ibrahim ibn Maysarah said: 
“Tawus said to me: ‘Either you get married, or I will say to you what ‘Umar said to Abu’l-Zawaid: There is nothing stopping you from getting married but either impotence or immorality!’ According to al-Mirwadhi, Ahmad said: ‘Celibacy has nothing to do with Islam. Whoever calls you not to get married is calling you to something other than Islam.’”
Benefits of marriage
Then he said (may Allah have mercy on him):
“The benefits of marriage are many. They include: protecting one’s religion and helping one to adhere to it; protecting and taking care of women; and producing offspring and increasing the ranks of the ummah, thus achieving the pride of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), etc.”
[Translator’s note: there is a hadith which indicates that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will feel proud of the large numbers of his ummah in the Hereafter, so Muslims are encouraged to marry and have many children.]
It should now be clear that the benefits of marriage are many. No wise Muslim woman would hesitate to get married, especially if an offer of marriage comes from a person who is strongly committed to Islam and is possessed of a good character and morals.

      what are the consequences and can people use it to kill people.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, there is sihr that can kill. When discussing different
    forms of murder the scholars have mentioned that the person who kills another by means of
    a kind of sihr that usually kills should be executed (qisaas –
    retaliation), because he has killed by means of something that usually kills. Ibn Qudaamah
    said in al-Mughni (9/330): “The sixth kind: if he killed him by means of a
    kind of sihr that usually kills, then he has to be executed, because he has killed
    by means of something that usually kills, like killing by use of a knife. If he killed by
    means of something that does not usually kill or something that sometimes kills and
    sometimes does not, then he has to pay diyah (blood-money), but qisaas is not required,
    because he intended to do harm, and it is akin to beating someone with a stick (which may
    or may not kill).”
The ruling concerning the saahir (practitioner of sihr)
    in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (24/267) says that in the case where he killed a
    person by means of his sihr… the majority say that killing by means of sihr
    may be done deliberately, in which case qisaas is required. According to the
    Maalikis, evidence or a confession is required. According to the Shaafi’is, if the
    person whom the practitioner of sihr killed was his equal , then qisaas is required
    if the killing was deliberate, which may be proven by a confession on the part of the saahir,
    such as his saying “I killed him by means of my sihr”, or “I killed
    him with this type of thing”, supported by the testimony of two reliable witnesses
    who have practised sihr in the past but have now repented, who can confirm that
    this kind of sihr usually kills. If it is a type that does not usually kill, then
    the matter is more akin to manslaughter.

1672,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1672,Expiation for one who had intercourse with his wife during the day in Ramadan,"My question is complex. First, during the first Ramadan that my wife and I were married, we did something that we are ashamed of and have sincerely repented for; and that is have intercourse while fasting. Unfortunately, this occured 2 or 3 times.
I have come to know that the correct action for this is to: first free a slave or second, fast for 60 days continuously. The first option of freeing a slave is not possible, so my question is about fasting.
I could fast for sixty days but since it is continuous, I believe that I would not be able to provide for my family (fasting weakens me, and my job is a physical one, without energy, It becomes unbelievably difficult). It is hard enough to make it through Ramadan and earn enough money ( with Allah's will) to provide for my family. What options are left to me. I am aware of the hadith were a poor man came to the prophet (pbuh) and he was given the options free a slave, fast, and he couldn't do either, so he was given dates to give to the poorest family, which was his, so he took them to his family. How does this apply to me? I alhamdulilah, am not rich, but am not poor either (mostly pay check to pay check) - my wife and I feel tremendous guilt about this. Please help! Also, if one is to fast is that 60 days for each time one had intercourse during Ramadans fast?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Our advice is that you should try to fast the two consecutive months during cold or temperate days when the days will be shorter and it will be less difficult for you, or during the annual leave which your employer gives you, and other opportunities which you can make use of for this purpose. If you really and truly cannot fast, then it is permissible for you to feed sixty poor persons. You could give them food in stages – according to what you are able to do – until you have fed the complete number. Your wife also has to make a similar expiation if she was a willing partner in the act of intercourse during the day in Ramadan. If the number of times that intercourse took place happened on different days, then you have to offer expiation for each day on which the sanctity of the sacred month was broken. The author of Kifaayat al-Taalib said: “The number of expiations corresponds to the number of days, not to the number of times the act was repeated on one day before the payment of any expiation. This is by consensus (of the scholars).” It was said in Haashiyat al-Dasooqi: “It is not counted by the number of times a person ate or had intercourse in one day.” The author of Mughni al-Muhtaaj said: “Expiation is counted by the number of misdeeds… (whoever had intercourse on two different days must pay expiation twice)… because each day is a separate, independent act of worship, so the expiation for both cannot be combined… If the act of intercourse happened several times in one day, the separate acts are not counted [i.e. one expiation is sufficient].” Allah burdens not any person, but that which he can bear.
The hadeeth to which you refer in your question was narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “Whilst we were sitting with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), a man came to him and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, I am doomed!’ He said, ‘What happened to you?’ He said: ‘I had intercourse with my wife whilst I was fasting.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked: ‘Could you find a slave you could set free?’ He said, ‘No.’ He asked, ‘Are you able to fast for two consecutive months?’ He said, ‘No.’ He asked, ‘Can you feed sixty poor persons?’ He said, ‘No.’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fell silent. Whilst we were (sitting) like that, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was brought a container of dates. He said, ‘Where is the one who was asking?’ The man said, ‘I (am here).’ He said, ‘Take these and give them in charity.’ The man said, ‘Who is poorer than I, O Messenger of Allah? There is no household between the two lava fields (i.e., in Madeenah) that is poorer than my household.’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) smiled until his back teeth could be seen, then he said: ‘Feed it to your family.’” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Fath, 1936).
According to a report narrated by Ahmad from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), whilst the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sitting in the shade of the fortress of Hassaan, a man came to him and said, “I have been burnt, O Messenger of Allah!” He asked, “What is wrong with you?” He said, “I had intercourse with my wife whilst I was fasting.” She [‘Aa’ishah] said: that was in Ramadaan. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him, “Sit down,” so he sat down at the back of the gathering. Then a man came with a donkey on whose back was a basket of dates, and said: “This is my sadaqah (charity) O Messenger of Allah.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Where is the burnt one who just came?” He said: “Here I am, O Messenger of Allah.” He said: “Take this and give it in charity.” He said, “Where should it go except to me and my family, O Messenger of Allah? By Him Who sent you with the truth, I cannot find anything for me and my family.” He said: “Take it.” So he took it. (al-Musnad 6/276).

Do they need forgiveness?,"I have been told by someone claiming to be a Muslim that all God's prophets, including Mohammed, were without sin, (perfect), never requiring forgiveness. Is this a view held officially by Islam as a whole?",,,"Praise be to Allah.We thank you for sending this question in an effort to find the right answer instead of merely accepting what you have heard from someone who claims to be a Muslim.
The ummah (Muslim nation) is agreed that the Messengers are infallible in carrying out their mission they do not forget anything that Allah has revealed to them except with regard to matters that have been abrogated. They are also infallible in conveying the Message they do not conceal anything that Allah has revealed to them, for that would be a betrayal and it is impossible to imagine that they could do such a thing. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): O Messenger! Proclaim (the Message) which has been sent down to you from your Lord. And if you do not ,then you have not conveyed His Message [al-Maaidah 5:67]. If anything is concealed or changed, then the punishment of Allah will befall the one who is guilty of doing these things, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): And if he [Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] had forged a false saying concerning Us [Allah], We surely would have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might), and then certainly should have cut off his life artery (aorta). [al-Haqqah 69:44-46]. One aspect of infallibility is that they (the Prophets) do not forget anything of that which Allah has revealed to them, and thus no part of the revelation is lost.
[Al-rusul wal-risaalaat (The Messengers and their missions), Omar al-Ashqar, p. 97]
Omar al-Ashqar also said (op. cit., p.102): The Prophets and Messengers may also strive to find the right judgement in the situations with which they are faced, and they judge according to what they themselves see and hear they do not have knowledge of the Unseen. They may make an incorrect judgement, as happened to the Prophet of Allah Dawood (David), who failed to do so, and Allah helped his son Sulaymaan (Solomon) to come up with the right answer in that particular case. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that he heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: There were two women, each of whom had a son. A wolf came and carried off the son of one of them, who said to the other, The wolf has taken your son. The other said, No, he took your son. They came to Dawood to ask him to judge between them, and he ruled in favour of the older woman. Then they went to Sulaymaan the son of Dawood and told him what had happened. He said, Bring a knife and divide the child between them. The younger woman said, Do not do that, may Allah have mercy on you! He is her son. So Sulaymaan ruled in favour of the younger woman. (Reported by al-Bukhari).
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained this story: Umm Salamah, the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) narrated that he heard a dispute going on at the door of his apartment, so he went out and told them: I am no more than a human being. Disputing parties may come to me, and one of you may be more eloquent and persuasive than the other, so I may think that he is telling the truth and rule in favour of him. Whoever has a judgement in favour of him to the detriment of a fellow-Muslims rights, this is a piece of the Fire let him take it or leave it.
When it comes to the idea of the Prophets committing major sins (kabaair), Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said (in al-Fataawaa, 4/319): The belief that the Prophets are free of major sins, but not of minor sins, is the opinion of the majority of Islamic scholars and of all (Muslim) groups It is the opinion of most mufassireen (commentators on the Quran), scholars of hadeeth and fuqaha (jurists).
With regard to whether it is possible for the Prophets to commit minor sins, in Lawaami al-Anwaar al-Bahiyyah (2/214), al-Safaareeni quoted from Ibn Hamdaan who said in Nihaayat al-Mubtadieen: They are infallible in conveying the commands and message of Allah, but they are not infallible in any other regard. They may make mistakes, forget things, or commit minor sins according to the most well-known opinion (of the scholars) but they will not be approved for these mistakes.
The majority of scholars take the following as evidence to support their claim that the Prophets are not free from minor sins:


Adams sin in eating from the tree from which Allah had forbidden him to eat. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): And (remember) when We said to the angels, Prostrate yourselves to Adam. They prostrated (all) except Iblees (Satan), who refused. Then We said, O Adam! Verily, this is an enemy to you and to your wife. So let him not get you both out of Paradise, so that you be distressed in misery. Verily, you have (a promise from Us) that you will never be hungry therein nor naked. And you (will) suffer not from thirst therein nor from the suns heat. Then Shaytaan whispered to him, saying: O Adam! Shall I lead you to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that shall never waste away? Then they both ate of the tree, and so their private parts appeared to them, and they began to stick on themselves leaves from Paradise for their covering. Thus did Adam disobey his Lord, so he went astray. [Ta-Ha 20:116-121]


When Nooh prayed for his kaafir son, Allah rebuked him for doing so, and taught him that this person was not a member of his family, and that this prayer was not a righteous deed on his part. So Nooh sought forgiveness from his Lord, repented and returned to Allah: Nooh said: O my Lord! I seek refuge with You from asking You that of which I have no knowledge. And unless You forgive me and have Mercy on me, I would indeed be one of the losers. [Hood 11:47 interpretation of the meaning].


When Dawood realized that he had been too quick to judge, without listening to what the second disputant had to say, he hastened to repent: and he sought Forgiveness of his Lord, and he fell down prostrate and turned (to Allah) in repentance. [Saad 38:24 interpretation of the meaning].


Everyone, even the Prophets, is in need of the forgiveness of Allah. Allah has blessed His Prophets by forgiving their sins, and He has blessed our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as He said (interpretation of the meaning): That Allah may forgive you your sins of the past and the future, and complete His favour upon you, and guide you on the Straight Path. [al-Fath 48:2]
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said, in al-Fataawaa 10/296, Concerning the issue of forgiveness of the Prophets sins: Allah, may He be exalted, does not speak of any Prophet in the Quraan, except He also mentions repentance and seeking forgiveness. For example, Adam and his wife said: Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You forgive us not, and bestow not upon us Your Mercy, we shall certainly be of the losers. [al-Araaf 7:23 interpretation of the meaning]. Nooh said: O my Lord! I seek refuge with You from asking You that of which I have no knowledge. And unless You forgive me and have Mercy on me, I would indeed be one of the losers. [Hood 11:47 interpretation of the meaning]. Ibraaheem said: Our Lord! Forgive me and my parents, and (all) the Believers on the Day when the reckoning will be established. [Ibraaheem 14:41 interpretation of the meaning] and You are our wali (Protector), so forgive us and have Mercy on us, for You are the Best of those who forgive. And ordain for us good in this world, and in the Hereafter. Certainly we have turned unto You [al-Araaf 7:155-156 interpretation of the meaning]. Moosa said: You are our wali (Protector), so forgive us and have Mercy on us, for You are the Best of those who forgive. [al-Araaf 7:155 interpretation of the meaning]. Then he [Ibn Taymiyah, may Allah have mercy on him] gave further examples, but what we have mentioned here is sufficient.

1692,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1692,What Are the Forbidden Names in Islam?,"Are there any names which it is forbidden to use? If so, what are they?","There are names which we are forbidden to use such as names which belong only to Allah, names which befit no one except the Prophet, and names which imply enslavement to anything besides Allah.","Forbidden names


Disliked names in Islam","Praise be to Allah.Forbidden names
Yes, there are names which we are forbidden to use, examples of which are as follows:

Names which belong only to Allah 

It is forbidden to use any name which belongs only to Allah , such as al-Khaliq (the Creator) and al-Quddus (the Most Holy), or names which do not befit any except Allah, such as Malik al-Muluk (King of Kings). This is the consensus of the fuqaha.
Ibn al-Qayyim said that names which belong only to Allah include : al-Ahad (the One), al-Samad (the Eternal), al-Khaliq (the Creator), al-Razzaq (the Provider), al-Jabbar (the Compeller), al-Mutakabbir (the Majestic), al-Awwal (the First), al-Akhir (the Last), al-Batin (the Hidden) and Allam al-Ghuyub (the Knower of the Unseen). (Tuhfat al-Mawdud, p. 98)
The evidence that it is forbidden to call anyone by a name which belongs only to Allah, such as Malik al-Muluk (king of kings), may be seen for example in the hadith narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him); in the version narrated by al-Bukhari, he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The most despised name with Allah on the Day of Resurrection will be a man called Malik al-Muluk. According to Muslim, he said, The man who will be most deserving of Allah’s anger and most evil on the Day of Resurrection will be a man who was called Malik al-Amlak. There is no King except Allah.
As regards using names that may be used for Allah or for others, it is permissible to use these names, such as ‘Ali (High), Rashid (Guide) and Badi’ (Innovator or Originator).
Ibn ‘Abidin said: “It seems to be the case that they are permitted, even if the definite article “al” is used. Al-Hasqafi said: What (these names) mean concerning us (human beings) is different from their meanings concerning Allah, may He be exalted.

Names which befit no one except the Prophet

It is forbidden to use names which befit no one except the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), such as Sayyid Walad Adam (master of the sons of Adam), Sayyid al-Nas (master of mankind), Sayyid al-Kull (master of all), because these names, as the Hanbalis said, befit no one except him, (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).

Names which imply enslavement to anything besides Allah

It is forbidden to use any name which implies enslavement to anything besides Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, such as ‘Abd al-’Uzza (slave of al-’Uzza a pagan goddess), ‘Abd al-Ka’bah (slave of the Ka’bah), ‘Abd al-Dar (slave of the House), ‘Abd ‘Ali (slave of ‘Ali), ‘Abd al-Husayn (slave of Husayn), etc.
It was stated in Hashiyat Ibn ‘Abidin that one should not be called ‘Abd Fulan (slave of so-and-so).
It says in Kashshaf al-Qina’: ‘They (the scholars) agreed that every name which implies enslavement to anything other than Allah is forbidden, such as ‘Abd al-’Uzza, ‘Abd ‘Amr, ‘Abd ‘Ali, ‘Abd al-Ka’bah, and any other similar names, such as ‘Abd al-Nabi (slave of the Prophet), ‘Abd al-Husayn, ‘Abd al-Masih (slave of the Messiah).” (Hashiyat Ibn ‘Abidin, 5/268;Mughni al-Muhtaj, 4/295; Tuhfat al-Muhtaj, 10/373; Kashshaf al-Qina’, 3/27; Tuhfat al-Mawdud, p. 90)
The evidence that it is forbidden to use any name which implies enslavement to anything other than Allah may be seen in the report of Ibn Abi Shaybah from Yazid ibn al-Miqdam ibn Shurayh, from his father, from his grandfather Hani ibn Yazid, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: A delegation came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he heard them calling someone ‘Abd al-Hajar (slave of the stone). He asked him, What is your name? and he said, ‘Abd al-Hajar. He said, No, you are ‘Abd-Allah (the slave of Allah). (Al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 11/335)

Using names of idols

Using the names of idols that are worshipped instead of Allah.

Names of devils

It is forbidden to use the names of devils (shayatin), such as Khanzab and Iblis. It was reported that the Sunnah is to change names such as these.
Disliked names in Islam
Names that are makruh (disliked) may be categorized as follows:

Names that have bad or distasteful meanings

It is makruh to use names that have bad or distasteful meanings, or which sound odd, which would cause others to mock a person or would cause him embarrassment, in addition to being contrary to the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who taught us to choose good names.

Names whose meanings are too soft and provocative or sexy

It is makruh to use names whose meanings are too soft and provocative or sexy, which is a widespread problem in the naming of girls.

Naming someone after promiscuous actors and singers

It is makruh to deliberately name someone after promiscuous actors and singers who star in worthless entertainment shows.
One of the signs of empty-headedness and lack of pride in one's faith is the fact that after a show starring immoral women, people will compete with one another in naming their newborns after these women. Anyone who checks the names registered at the time of one of these shows will see that this is a fact. And our complaining is to Allah.

Names that convey any sense of sin

It is makruh to use names that convey any sense of sin and disobedience to Allah.
Foreign names that belong only to the unbelievers
It is makruh to use foreign names that belong only to the unbelievers.
The proud Muslim who is content with his religion will avoid this and not come anywhere near it. The temptation to use these names is very strong in our time, and a Muslim might pick up any name from Europe and America. This is the worst type of sin and a sign of humiliation and defeat. If this imitation of the unbelievers and using their names is merely the matter of whims and stupidity, it is nevertheless a major sin; if it is done because one actually believes these names are better than Muslim names, then this is a devastating blow to the foundation of faith. In either case, the person who has done this must hasten to repent, and changing the name is a condition of repentance.

Names of Pharaohs or other tyrants

It is makruh to use the names of Pharaohs or other tyrants.

Names that have any undesirable meaning

It is makruh to use names that have any undesirable meaning.

Naming people after animals

It is makruh to name people after animals that are known for their bad qualities. When the Arabs called their children by such names, it was because of good qualities that they noticed in them, and this was the desired meaning. So when they used the name Kalb (dog), it was because of the dogs alertness and ability to work hard; when they used the name Himar (donkey), it was because of the donkeys patience and forbearance, and so on This refutes the false arguments of the Shu’ubiyyah against the Arabs, as was explained by Ibn Durayd, Ibn Faris, and others.

Names which are composed of any word added to such words as al-Din or Islam

It is makruh to use any name which is composed of any word added to such words as al-Din (the Religion) or Islam, such as Nur al-Din/Nuruddin (Light of the Religion), Diya al-Din/Ziauddin (Brightness of the Religion), Sayf al-Islam (Sword of Islam), Nur al-Islam (Light of Islam), etc. 
This is because of the great status attached to these words, al-Din and Islam. Adding words to them to form names is an exaggeration which borders on lying, which is why some scholars said that this is haram, and the majority say that it is makruh, because it gives an incorrect impression which should not be given. The way this practice started was that these were titles which were added to people’s names, then people started to use them as names.
Names of this sort may be forbidden for two reasons. In a name such as Shihab al-Din, for example, the word Shihab means a flame, which comes from fire, then this is added to the word al-Din (which is inappropriate). This can lead to the use of strange names, as in Indonesia, where people use names such as Dhahab al-Din (gold of the Religion) and Mas al-Din (diamond of the Religion)!
Imam al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him), used to dislike being called by his nickname Muhiy al-Din, and Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) used to dislike being called by his nickname Taqiy al-Din, and he said, But my family gave me this nickname, so I am known by it.

Names which include the word al-Rasul

Names which include the word al-Rasul (the Messenger) are also makruh.

Names of angels

Some of the scholars regarded using the names of angels (peace be upon them) as makruh. Giving angels’ names to women is clearly haram, because it implies imitation of the mushrikin, who thought that the angels were the daughters of Allah, Exalted be He above what they say!

Names of Surahs of the Quran

Some of the scholars thought that it was makruh to give people the names of Surahs of the Quran, such as Ta-Ha, Ya-Sin, Ha-Mim. (The popular notion that Ya-Sin and Ta-Ha are names of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is not correct).

Will we receive two rewards?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Combining acts of worship is of two types:
One type is not correct, which is in the case of acts of worship which are independent or are part of another. In these cases, intentions cannot be combined. For example, if a man misses the Sunnah of Fajr, and the sun comes up and the time for Salaat al-Duhaa comes, the Sunnah of Fajr cannot take the place of Salaat al-Duhaa, or vice-versa. They cannot be combined, because the Sunnah of Fajr is independent, and Salaat al-Duhaa is independent, and neither of them can take the place of the other.
The same applies if an act is connected to the one that comes before it – they cannot be combined. So if a man says, “I want to have the intention of praying both fard and sunnah when I pray Fajr,” we would tell him that this is not correct, because the Sunnah (of Fajr) is directly connected to the Fard, and cannot take its place.
The second type is where what is intended is not a specific act of worship. In this case, intentions may be combined. For example: a man enters the mosque where the people are praying Salaat al-Fajr. It is known that when a man enters the mosque, he should not sit down until he prays two rak’ahs, so if he joins the imaam in that prayer, this is good enough. Why? Because the point is that he should pray two rak’ahs when he enters the mosque. Similarly, if a man enters the mosque at the time of Salaat al-Duhaa and prays two rak’ahs with the intention of praying Salaat al-Duhaa, he does not have to pray Tahiyyat al-Masjid as well, but if he has the intention of both, that is better. This is the guideline for combining acts of worship.
In the case of fasting, fasting the Day of ‘Arafaah, for example, means that when this day comes you will be fasting, whether you intended it as one of the three days which you fast every month or as the Day of ‘Arafaah. But if you intended it as the Day of ‘Arafaah, it will not count as one of the three days; but if you intended it as one of the three days, that is good enough and will count as the Day of ‘Arafaah too. If you intended both, that is preferable.","(Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 51/19)"

As for the skins of animals whose meat we cannot eat, such as dogs, wolves, lions, elephants and the like, it is impure (naajis), whether it is slaughtered or it dies or is killed, because even if it is slaughtered it does not become halal and cannot be good, so it is naajis, whether it is tanned or not tanned. This is according to the most correct opinion, because the most correct opinion is that impure skins cannot be made pure through tanning if they come from animals which we are not permitted to slaughter for food.
As for the skins of animals which have died before they could be slaughtered properly, if these are tanned then they become pure, but before they are tanned they are impure. So now animal skins may be divided into three types:
The first type: those which are pure whether they are tanned or not, which are the skins of animals that may be eaten if they are slaughtered correctly.
The second type: skins which cannot be pure either before or after tanning, because they are impure. These are the skins of animals whose meat we cannot eat, like pigs.
The third type: skins which become pure after tanning, but are not pure before before tanning. These are the skins of animals whose meat may be eaten if they are slaughtered properly but not if they die otherwise.","Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 52/39"

If she is a woman who has knowledge, she will know that this is prescribed by Islam and that there is nothing wrong with him doing and saying this in such a way that she can hear it. As for praying two rak’ahs when he enters the room where his wife is, it was reported that some of the salaf did this, so if the man does this it is good, and if he does not do it, there is nothing wrong with that.

How to drink Zamzam water


Can you take Zamzam water back to your country?","Praise be to Allah.What is Zamzam?
Zamzam is the name of a famous well in al-Masjid al-Haram [the Sacred Mosque in Makkah], which is thirty-eight cubits away from the Ka`bah. It is the well of Isma’il, the son of Ibrahim (peace and blessings of Allah be upon them both), from which Allah quenched the thirst of Isma’il when he was an infant. His mother looked for water for him, but could not find any. She climbed to the top of al-Safa, praying to Allah to help her and give her water for Isma’il, then she climbed to the top of al-Marwah and did the same. Allah sent Jibril, and he struck the earth with his heels, and water appeared.
Virtues of drinking from the water of Zamzam
The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) agreed that it is recommended for pilgrims on Hajj and `Umrah in particular, and for all Muslims in general, to drink Zamzam water, because of the authentic hadith in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is reported to have drunk the water of Zamzam . (Al-Bukhari, 3/492) 
According to the hadith of Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said concerning the water of Zamzam, “It is a blessing, and it is food that satisfies.” (Reported by Muslim, 4/1922). Al-Tayaalisi (61) added, in a version that he narrated: “and a cure for the sick.” I.e., drinking the water of Zamzam means that a person does not need to eat, and it will cure his sickness – but this is when he drinks it with faith and sincerity, as proven in the hadith of Abu Dharr al-Ghifari who stayed in Makkah for a month without any nourishment except Zamzam water.
Al-`Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The people used to compete over Zamzam during the time of Jahiliyyah. People who had children used to bring them and give them to drink, and this was their early-morning victuals. We used to used to think that it was a help for people who had children.” Al-'Abbas said: “During the Jahiliyyah, Zamzam was known as Shaba’ah (satisfaction).”
Al-‘Allamah al-Abbi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“(The water) is for whatever purpose it is drunk for, and Allah made it food and drink for Isma’il and his mother Hajar .”
Ibn al-Mubarak entered Zamzam and said, “O Allah, Ibn al-Mu’ammal told me, from Abu’l-Zubayr from Jabir that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The water of Zamzam is for whatever purpose it is drunk for,’ so, O Allah, I am drinking it (to quench) my thirst on the Day of Resurrection.”
The two angels washed the heart of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he was a child, after they had taken it out, then they put it back. Al-Hafiz al-'Iraqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The reason why the Prophet’s chest was washed with Zamzam water was to make him stronger so that he could see the kingdom of heaven and earth, and Paradise and Hell, because one of the special qualities of Zamzam is that it strengthens the heart and calms the soul. The report about the chest of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) being washed with the water of Zamzam is proven in the hadith of Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him), who reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “My roof was opened when I was in Makkah, and Jibril (peace be upon him) came down and opened my chest, then he washed it with Zamzam water. Then he brought a gold basin full of wisdom and faith, poured it into my chest, and closed it up again. Then he took me by the hand and ascended with me into the first heaven.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 3/429)
How to drink Zamzam water
It is sunnah to drink one’s fill of Zamzam water and to quench one’s thirst.
The jurists have mentioned the etiquette that is recommended when drinking Zamzam water, such as facing the Ka`bah , saying Bismillah, pausing to take a breath three times, drinking one’s fill, praising Allah after one finishes, and sitting whilst drinking it, as one should do when drinking other kinds of drinks. 
As regards the hadith of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), who said, “I gave the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) Zamzam water to drink whilst he was standing,” (reported by al-Bukhari, 3/492), it is taken to mean that it is permissible to drink whilst standing, and the disapproval of doing so is understood to mean that it is disliked. 
The scholars also recommended that the person who drinks Zamzam water should sprinkle some of it on his head, face and chest, make lots of du`a when drinking it, and to drink it for a purpose that will benefit him in this world or the next, because of the hadith in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The water of Zamzam is for whatever purpose it is drunk for.” (Reported by Ibn Majah, 2/1018; see Al-Maqasid al-Hasanah by al-Sakhawi, p. 359)
When Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) drank from the water of Zamzam, he said: “O Allah, I ask you for beneficial knowledge, plentiful provision and healing from every disease.”
Al-Daynuri reported that al-Humaydi said: “We were with Sufyan ibn ‘Uyaynah, and he told us the hadith about the water of Zamzam being drunk for whatever purpose it is drunk for. A man got up and left the gathering, then he came back and said, ‘O Abu Muhammad, is the hadith which you told us about the water of Zamzam sahih?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ The man said, ‘Just now I drank a bucket of Zamzam so that you would tell me one hundred hadiths.’ Sufyan said, ‘Sit down,’ so he sat down and he told him one hundred hadiths.”
Can you take Zamzam water back to your country?
Some jurists recommended that people should take some Zamzam water back with them to their countries, because it is a cure for those who seek healing. `Aishah reported that she took Zamzam water home with her in bottles, and said, “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took some of it away with him, and he used to pour it on the sick and give it to them to drink.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 4/37)
The jurists agreed that it is permissible to use Zamzam water to purify oneself , but they advised that it should not be used for any inappropriate purposes such as removing impurity and so on. 
Al-‘Allamah al-Bahuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book Kashshaf al-Qina’: 
“Only this (using Zamzam water to remove najasah) is considered to be makruh, out of respect, but it is not makruh to use it to purify oneself, because ‘Ali said: ‘The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) departed (from Muzdalifah) and called for a bucket of Zamzam water. He drank from it, then did wudu. (Reported by ‘Abd-Allah ibn Ahmad with a sahih isnad).” (See Nayl al-Awtar, Kitab al-Taharah, Bab Tahuriyyat al-Bahr).
Al-Hafiz al-Sakhawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Maqasid al-Hasanah:
“Some people said that the virtue (of Zamzam water) remains only so long as it is in its place (of origin), and that when it is taken away, it changes. This is an idea that has no basis. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wrote to Suhayl ibn `Amr: “If my letter reaches you at night, do not wait until morning, and if it reaches you during the day, do not wait until evening, to send me some Zamzam water.” He sent him two containers full, and at that time he was in Madinah, before the Conquest of Makkah. This hadith is hasan because of corroborating evidence. `Aishah also used to take Zamzam water away with her, and she reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do this; he used to carry it in small vessels and buckets, and pour it onto the sick and give it to them to drink. 
Whenever a guest visited Ibn `Abbas he would honour him by giving him Zamzam to drink. `Ata was asked about taking Zamzam water away, and he said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), al-Hasan and al-Husayn all took it away with them.”

What to do in Dhul Hijjah","Praise be to Allah.Benefits of seasons of worship 
Praise be to Allah Who has created time and has made some times better than others, some months and days and nights better than others, when rewards are multiplied many times, as a mercy towards His slaves. This encourages them to do more righteous deeds and makes them more eager to worship Him, so that the Muslim renews his efforts to gain a greater share of reward, prepare himself for death and supply himself in readiness for the Day of Judgement.
This season of worship brings many benefits, such as the opportunity to correct one’s faults and make up for any shortcomings or anything that one might have missed. Every one of these special occasions involves some kind of worship through which the slaves may draw closer to Allah, and some kind of blessing through which Allah bestows His favour and mercy upon whomsoever He will. The happy person is the one who makes the most of these special months, days and hours and draws nearer to his Lord during these times through acts of worship; he will most likely be touched by the blessing of Allah and will feel the joy of knowing that he is safe from the flames of Hell. (Ibn Rajab, al-Lataif, p.8)
The Muslim must understand the value of his life, increase his worship of Allah and persist in doing good deeds until the moment of death. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""And worship your Lord until there comes unto you the certainty."" [al-Hijr 15:99] The commentators said: ""‘The certainty’ means death.""
Virtues of the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah
Among the special seasons of worship are the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah , which Allah has preferred over all the other days of the year. Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""There are no days in which righteous deeds are more beloved to Allah than these ten days."" The people asked, ""Not even jihad for the sake of Allah?"" He said, ""Not even jihad for the sake of Allah, except in the case of a man who went out to fight giving himself and his wealth up for the cause, and came back with nothing."" (Reported by al-Bukhari, 2/457).
Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) also reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""There is no deed more precious in the sight of Allah, nor greater in reward, than a good deed done during the ten days of Sacrifice ."" He was asked, ""Not even jihad for the sake of Allah?"" He said, ""Not even jihad for the sake of Allah, except in the case of a man who went out to fight giving himself and his wealth up for the cause, and came back with nothing."" (Reported by al-Darimi, 1/357; its isnad is hasan as stated in al-Irwa, 3/398).
These texts and others indicate that these ten days are better than all the other days of the year, with no exceptions, not even the last ten days of Ramadan. But the last ten nights of Ramadan are better, because they include Laylat al-Qadr (""the Night of Decree""), which is better than a thousand months. Thus the various reports may be reconciled. (See Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 5/412).
Reasons behind the virtues of the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah
You should know, my brother in Islam, that the virtue of these ten days is based on many things:

Allah swears an oath by them, and swearing an oath by something is indicative of its importance and great benefit. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""By the dawn; by the ten nights"" [al-Fajr 89:1-2]. Ibn 'Abbas, Ibn al-Zubayr, Mujahid and others of the earlier and later generations said that this refers to the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah. Ibn Kathir said: ""This is the correct opinion."" (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 8/413)
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) testified that these are the best days of this world, as we have already quoted above from sahih ahadith.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) encouraged people to do righteous deeds because of the virtue of this season for people throughout the world, and also because of the virtue of the place - for the Hujjaj (pilgrims) to the Sacred House of Allah.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us to recite a lot of Tasbih (""Subhan-Allah""), Tahmid (""Al-hamdu Lillah"") and Takbir (""Allahu akbar"") during this time. ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""There are no days greater in the sight of Allah and in which righteous deeds are more beloved to Him than these ten days, so during this time recite a great deal of Tahlil (""La ilaha ill-Allah""), Takbir and Tahmid."" (Reported by Ahmad, 7/224; Ahmad Shakir stated that it is sahih).
These ten days include Yawm ‘Arafah (the Day of ‘Arafah ), on which Allah perfected His Religion. Fasting on this day will expiate for the sins of two years. These days also include Yawm al-Nahar (the Day of Sacrifice ), the greatest day of the entire year and the greatest day of Hajj , which combines acts of worship in a way unlike any other day.
These ten days include the days of sacrifice and of Hajj.

Things to avoid in Dhul Hijjah
Question: What must the Muslim avoid during these ten days if he wants to offer a sacrifice?
The Sunnah indicates that the one who wants to offer a sacrifice must stop cutting his hair and nails and removing anything from his skin, from the beginning of the ten days until after he has offered his sacrifice, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""When you see the new moon of Dhul-Hijjah, if any one of you wants to offer a sacrifice, then he should stop cutting his hair and nails until he has offered his sacrifice."" According to another report he said: ""He should not remove (literally, touch) anything from his hair or skin."" (reported by Muslim with four isnads, 13/146)
The Prophet’s instruction here makes one thing obligatory and his prohibition makes another haram, according to the soundest opinion, because these commands and prohibitions are unconditional and unavoidable. However, if a person does any of these things deliberately, he must seek Allah’s forgiveness but is not required to offer (an extra) sacrifice in expiation; his sacrifice will be acceptable. Whoever needs to remove some hair, nails, etc. because it is harming him, such as having a broken nail or a wound in a site where there is hair, should do so, and there is nothing wrong with that. The state of ihram is so important that it is permitted to cut one’s hair if leaving it will cause harm. There is nothing wrong with men or women washing their heads during the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) only forbade cutting the hair, not washing it.
The wisdom behind this prohibition of the one who wants to offer a sacrifice from cutting his hair etc., is so that he may resemble those in ihram in some aspects of the rites performed, and so that he may draw closer to Allah by offering the sacrifice. So he leaves his hair and nails alone until the time when he has offered his sacrifice, in the hope that Allah will save him in his entirety from the Fire. And Allah knows best.
If a person has cut his hair or nails during the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah because he was not planning to offer a sacrifice, then he decides later, during the ten days, to offer a sacrifice, then he must refrain from cutting his hair and nails from the moment he makes this decision.
Some women may delegate their brothers or sons to make the sacrifice on their behalf, then cut their hair during these ten days. This is not correct, because the ruling applies to the one who is offering the sacrifice, whether or not he (or she) delegates someone else to carry out the actual deed. The prohibition does not apply to the person delegated, only to the person who is making the sacrifice, as is indicated in the hadith. The person who is sacrificing on behalf of someone else, for whatever reason, does not have to adhere to this prohibition.
This prohibition appears to apply only to the one who is offering the sacrifice, not to his wife and children, unless any of them is offering a sacrifice in his or her own right, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to sacrifice ""on behalf of the family of Muhammad,"" but there are no reports that say he forbade them to cut their hair or nails at that time.
If a person was planning to offer a sacrifice, then he decides to go and perform Hajj, he should not cut his hair or nails if he wants to enter ihram, because the Sunnah is only to cut hair and nails when necessary. But if he is performing Tamattu’ [whereby he performs ‘Umrah, comes out of ihram and enters ihram anew for Hajj], he should trim his hair at the end of his ‘Umrah because this is part of the ritual.
The things that are described above as being prohibited for the person who is planning to offer a sacrifice are reported in the hadith quoted above; the person is not forbidden to wear perfume, have marital relations, wear sewn garments, etc.
What to do in Dhul Hijjah
Concerning the types of worship to be performed during these ten days, one must understand that these days are a great blessing from Allah to His slave, which is appreciated properly by the actively righteous. It is the Muslim’s duty to appreciate this blessing and make the most of the opportunity, by devoting these ten days to paying more attention to striving hard in worship. Among His blessings to His slaves, Allah has given us many ways in which to do good and worship Him, so that the Muslim may be constantly active and consistent in his worship of his Lord.
Among the good deeds which the Muslim should strive to do during the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah are:
    1.Fasting.
It is Sunnah to fast on the ninth day of Dhul-Hijjah , because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) urged us to do good deeds during this time, and fasting is one of the best of deeds. Allah has chosen fasting for Himself, as is stated in the hadith qudsi: ""Allah says: ‘All the deeds of the son of Adam are for him, except for fasting, which is for Me and I am the One Who will reward him for it.’"" (Reported by al-Bukhari, 1805).
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fast on the first nine days of Dhul-Hijjah. It was narrated from Hunaydah ibn Khalid from his wife, that one of the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fast on the first nine days of Dhul-Hijjah and the day of ‘Ashura, and three days each month, the first Monday of the month and two Thursdays. Narrated by al-Nasai, 4/205 and by Abu Dawud; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 2/462.
      2. Takbir . It is Sunnah to say Takbir (""Allahu akbar""), Tahmid (""Al-hamdu Lillah""), Tahlil (""La ilaha ill-Allah"") and Tasbih (""Subhan Allah"") during the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, and to say it loudly in the mosque, the home, the street and every place where it is permitted to remember Allah and mention His name out loud, as an act of worship and as a proclamation of the greatness of Allah, may He be exalted.
Men should recite these phrases out loud, and women should recite them quietly.
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""That they might witness things that are of benefit to them (i.e., reward of Hajj in the Hereafter, and also some worldly gain from trade, etc.), and mention the name of Allah on appointed days, over the beast of cattle that He has provided for them (for sacrifice)..."" [al-Hajj 22:28]
The majority of scholars agree that the ""appointed days"" are the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, because of the words of Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father): ""The ‘appointed days’ are the first ten days (of Dhul-Hijjah).""
The Takbir may include the words ""Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, la ilaha ill-Allah; wa Allahu akbar wa Lillaahi’l-hamd (Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, there is no god but Allah; Allah is Most Great and to Allah be praise),"" as well as other phrases.
Takbir at this time is an aspect of the Sunnah that has been forgotten, especially during the early part of this period, so much so that one hardly ever hears Takbir, except from a few people. This Takbir should be pronounced loudly, in order to revive the Sunnah and as a reminder to the negligent. There is sound evidence that Ibn ‘Umar and Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with them) used to go out in the marketplace during the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, reciting Takbir, and the people would recite Takbir when they heard them. The idea behind reminding the people to recite Takbir is that each one should recite it individually, not in unison, as there is no basis in Shari’ah for doing this.
Reviving aspects of the Sunnah that have been virtually forgotten is a deed that will bring an immense reward, as is indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): ""Whoever revives an aspect of my Sunnah that is forgotten after my death, he will have a reward equivalent to that of the people who follow him, without it detracting in the least from their reward."" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 7/443; this is a hasan hadith because of corroborating asanid).
      3.Performing Hajj and ‘Umrah. One of the best deeds that one can do during these ten days is to perform Hajj to the Sacred House of Allah. The one whom Allah helps to go on Hajj to His House and to perform all the rituals properly is included in the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): ""An accepted Hajj brings no less a reward than Paradise.""
    4.Doing more good deeds in general, because good deeds are beloved by Allah and will bring a great reward from Him. Whoever is not able to go to Hajj should occupy himself at this blessed time by worshipping Allah, praying (salah), reading Quran, remembering Allah, making supplication (du’a), giving charity, honouring his parents, upholding the ties of kinship, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and other good deeds and acts of worship.
      5.Sacrifice. One of the good deeds that will bring a person closer to Allah during these ten days is offering a sacrifice, by choosing a high-quality animal and fattening it, and spending money for the sake of Allah. (more information to follow, in sha Allah).
     6.Sincere repentance . One of the most important things to do during these ten days is to repent sincerely to Allah and to give up all kinds of disobedience and sin. Repentance means coming back to Allah and foregoing all the deeds, open and secret, that He dislikes, out of regret for what has passed, giving it up immediately and being determined never to return to it, but to adhere firmly to the Truth by doing what Allah loves.
If a Muslim commits a sin, he must hasten to repent at once, without delay, firstly because he does not know when he will die, and secondly because one evil deed leads to another.
Repentance at special times is very important because in most cases people’s thoughts turn towards worship at these times, and they are keen to do good, which leads to them recognizing their sins and feeling regret for the past. Repentance is obligatory at all times, but when the Muslim combines sincere repentance with good deeds during the days of most virtue, this is a sign of success, in sha Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""But as for him who repented, believed and did righteous deeds, then he will be among those who are successful."" [al-Qasas 28:67]
The Muslim should make sure that he does not miss any of these important occasions, because time is passing quickly. Let him prepare himself by doing good deeds which will bring him reward when he is most in need of it, for no matter how much reward he earns, he will find it is less than he needs; the time of departure is at hand, the journey is frightening, delusions are widespread, and the road is long, but Allah is ever watchful, and to Him will we return and render account. As the Quran says (interpretation of the meaning):
""So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it,
And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it."" [al-Zalzalah 99:7-8]
There is much to be gained, so make the most of the opportunity afforded by these invaluable and irreplaceable ten days. Hasten to do good works, before death strikes, before one can regret one’s negligence and failure to act, before one is asked to return to a place where no prayers will be answered, before death intervenes between the hopeful one and the things he hopes for, before you are trapped with your deeds in the grave.
O you whose hard heart is as dark as the night, is it not time that your heart was filled with light and became soft? Expose yourself to the gentle breeze of your Lord’s mercy during these ten days, for Allah will cause this breeze to touch whomever He wills, and whoever is touched by it will be happy on the Day of Judgement. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad and all his Family and Companions.
