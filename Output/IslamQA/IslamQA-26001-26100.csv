26067,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26067,He hired a woman to serve him then he agreed with her that she would be his slave,"Few years back, I needed servants for comfort and support and to fulfill my jobs, I was able to pay the servants what they wanted and to comfort them too on their conditions. There was a Young Lady among them who agreed, on our conditions. My servant was only there when I needed her a bit like part employment she came over when I needed her and went away when not needed. We made a contract that she would serve me because she agreed and I agreed with my side.
Hence, this young lady still lives in her parents home and is not married she agreed I be her master so it gives me the rights to touch her and look at her. We spent a lot of time together and I freed her from the contracts then got married together.
The point is that we get slaves from war time, but when will that come? Here she had agreed. And look after with the same standard of mine
Is there any haram element in this situation because the master only touched someone he owned, so this cannot be zinna.
-I would like to know the equities of slaves too
-How do you own a slave and what is the sharee condition?
-Can the master and slave have bodily contact and to what extent?
-Is there an age difference limit, i.e. they both can’t be same age?
-Can this kept secret or does everyone HAVE TO know?
-What is the minimum age the master and slave can be?
-IS SLAVES ARE ONLY AVAILABLE AT WAR-TIME, , IS THERE ANOTHER WAS OF OWNING A SLAVE?
Is it true our prophet (pbuh) owned many slaves, and called one ship?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Some of the questions are repeated and interconnected. We will answer them all – in sha Allaah – in the following points. 
Firstly: 
What you did with the servant woman is haraam and is not permissible. A servant woman is not a slave woman whom it is permissible to touch and have intercourse with. A servant woman is free and is not permissible for you except through marriage, which is what you did, but unfortunately you did it late. 
The contract that existed between you and the servant woman was a contract of employment, which was to serve you in your house. It was not a contract that permitted you to have intercourse with her. You say that she agreed that you would be her master and she let you touch her and look at her, and that you freed her from the contract, but this has no basis of validity in sharee’ah in the sense that you refer to. A free woman cannot become a slave unless she is a kaafir woman from a state that is at war with the Muslims and the Muslims have captured her. This does not apply in the case which you are asking about. 
Secondly: 
Slaves (men and women) may be taken in the wars that take place between Muslims and kaafirs, not in wars that are fought amongst the Muslims at times of tribulation. 
Islam limited the sources of slaves which existed before the mission of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to just one source, namely slavery resulting from capturing prisoners from among the kuffaar, including women and children. 
Shaykh al-Shanqeeti (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The reason why a person may be taken as a slave is his being a kaafir and waging war against Allaah and His Messenger. If Allaah enables the Muslims who are striving and sacrificing their lives and their wealth and all that Allaah has given them to make the word of Allaah supreme over the kaafirs, then He allows them to enslave the kuffaar when they capture them, unless the ruler chooses to free them or to ransom them, if that serves the interests of the Muslims. 
Adwa’ al-Bayaan, 3/387 
Thirdly: 
The mujaahideen take possession of slave women as they take possession of the spoils of war. It is permissible for the one who gains possession of male or female slaves to sell them. In both cases – owning a slave through battle or through purchase – it is not permissible for a man to have intercourse with a slave woman until after she has had one menstrual cycle from which it may be established that she is not pregnant. If she is pregnant, then he must wait until she has given birth. 
It was narrated that Ruwayfi’ ibn Thaabit al-Ansaari said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say on the day of Hunayn: “It is not permissible for any man who believes in Allaah and the Last Day to irrigate the crop of another else – meaning to have intercourse with a woman who is pregnant. And it is not permissible for a man who believes in Allaah and the Last Day to have intercourse with a captured woman until he has established that she is not pregnant. And it is not permissible for a man who believes in Allaah and the Last Day to sell any booty until it has been shared out.” 
Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2158; classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 1890. 
Fourthly: 
It is permissible for there to be a physical relationship between a man and his female slave just as there is between a man and his wife, unless he marries her off  to someone else, in which case it is not permissible for him to have intercourse with her because it is not permissible for a woman to be in an intimate relationship with two men at the same time. 
Fifthly: 
There are no limits with regard to the age difference between a man and his female slave, apart from the fact that it is not permissible for him to have intercourse with her until after she has become able for that. 
Sixthly: 
The relationship between a man and his female slave should be announced publicly and not kept secret. That is because there are rulings that stem from this announcement, such as if they have children, and so as to ward off any suspicions that people who see them together may have concerning him and her. 
Seventhly: 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) owned some male and female slaves, among whom were the following: 
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
Zayd ibn Haarithah ibn Shuraaheel, the beloved of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He freed him and arranged his marriage to his freed slave woman Umm Ayman, and she bore him Usaamah. His other slaves include Aslam, Abu Raafi’, Thawbaan, Abu Kabshah Sulaym, Shaqraan (whose name was Saalih), Rabaah (who was Nubian), Yassaar (who was also Nubian and was killed by the ‘Arniyeen); Mid’am and Kirkirah (another Nubian) – these two were killed at Khaybar. They also included Anjashah al-Haadi and Safeenah ibn Farookh, whose real name was Mihraan, but the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) called him Safeenah (= “ship”) because they used to make him carry their luggage when they traveled, so he said, “You are a ship (anta safeenah).” Abu Haatim said that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) freed him; someone else said that Umm Salamah freed him. The Prophet’s slaves also included Anasah, whose nickname was Abu Mashrah; Aflah; ‘Ubayd; Tahmaan – also known as Keesaan; Dhakwaan; Mihraan; Marwaan – although it was said that this was another name of Tahmaan, and Allaah knows best; Hunayn; Sandar; Fudaalah (who was Yemeni); Maaboor (who was a eunuch); Waaqid; Abu Waaqid; Qassaam; Abu ‘Usayb and Abu Muwayhabah.  
His female slaves included: Salma (Umm Raafi’); Maymoonah bint Sa’d; Khadrah; Radwa; Razeenah; Umm Dameerah; Maymoonah bint Abi ‘Usayb; Maariyah and Rayhaanah. 
Zaad al-Ma’aad, 1/114-116 
Eighthly: 
It is rare nowadays to find slaves in the shar’i sense in which it is permissible to be intimate with them etc. That is because most of the Muslims have long since given up the obligation of jihad for the sake of Allaah, in addition to their position of weakness and humiliation before their kaafir enemies, so that many of the majority-Muslim nations have signed the protocol that expressly forbids slavery and strives to put an end to it, which was agreed upon in the United Nations in 1953. 
Based on that we must be very careful in examining any case where people are bought and sold as slaves, and we must also beware of the misinterpretation of the word amah (pl. imaa’) (= slave woman) which some new Muslims understand to mean that enslavement takes place simply by paying the woman some money and agreeing to have intercourse with her. This is like prostitution which is now widespread in some immoral places, night clubs and telephone sex services. 
We ask Allaah to help us and you to be patient with regard to matters of our religion and to protect us from falling into evil.

26069,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26069,Marrying a second wife when one is not able to take care of two wives,"One man (muslim of course) much older than me (20 years)proposed me the merriage but he is not divorced with his first women. He helped me many times in my life and showed me the first steps towards Islam. My father and mother are mulims but they didn't learn me something about praying, fasting or zekat.

That brother is going to have two womens but he is not able to take care about both of them. I asked my cemaat about this problem and some people gave the positive answer some of them don't accept it. I feel respect for that brother but I am not sure that I can live with him. Could you give me the advice, please?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah has enjoined certain things on a man 
    who wants to marry more than one wife, which he must fulfil before he marries a second wife. One of these things is that he should be able treat 
    them both fairly with regard to spending, staying overnight and providing accommodation. If he knows that he is unable to do that or that it is 
    most likely that he cannot do so, it is not permissible for him to marry more than one wife. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if you fear that you shall not be 
    able to deal justly with the orphan girls then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four; but if you fear that you shall not be 
    able to deal justly (with them), then only one or (slaves) that your right hands possess. That is nearer to prevent you from doing injustice”
[al-Nisa’ 4:3]
Mujaahid said: do not deliberately try to mistreat any of them, rather adhere to equal 
    treatment with regard to dividing your time and spending, because this is something that a man can do. 
Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 
    5/407 
Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: As for fairness with regard 
    to spending and clothing, this is the Sunnah, following the example of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He treated 
    his wives equally with regard to spending just as he did with regard to dividing his time amongst them. 
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 
    32/269 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said: [The Prophet]  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to treat them equally with regard to spending the night with them, 
    providing accommodation and spending on them… but it is not obligatory to treat them equally with regard to that – i.e., love and intercourse – 
    because that is something that a man has no control over. 
Zaad al-Ma’aad, 
    1/151 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said:  If he provides each one of them with sufficient clothing, 
    maintenance and accommodation, it does not matter what he does after that of being more inclined towards one of them or giving gifts to them… 
Al-Fath, 9/391 
This is what Allaah has enjoined upon the one who wants to marry more than one wife. If a man 
    is able to do that, there is nothing wrong with agreeing to marry him. If he is not, then we do not advise marrying him, rather it is not 
    permissible for him to propose marriage in the first place. 
With regard to your saying that he is not 
    able to take care of two wives, if he is religiously-committed and of good character, and you can be patient and put up with some hardships in 
    life, then there is nothing wrong with your agreeing to marry him. Allaah has promised the poor man who wants to get married that He will make him 
    independent of means. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“If they be poor, Allaah will enrich them 
    out of His Bounty”
[al-Noor 24:32]
Some of the salaf used to get married seeking provision, acting in accordance with this verse. 
    But if you think that you will not be able to put up with some hardships in life, then there is nothing wrong with your refusing to marry him. The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) advised Faatimah bint Qays, when Mu’aawiyah (may Allaah be pleased with him) proposed to 
    her, not to marry him. He said, “He is a pauper and has no money.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1480). 
We hope that there will be no unlawful 
    relationship between you, either now or after you refuse to marry him. If he has done you some favour by showing you the right path and teaching 
    you, that is no justification for meeting, corresponding, speaking in private and so on.

26071,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26071,Do Angels and Jinn Die?,Do the angels and jinn die? Where are they buried? Is the funeral prayer offered for them? How long do each of them live?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Whatsoever is on it (the earth) will perish.
And the Face of your Lord full of Majesty and Honour will remain forever.” [55:26-27] 
Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Here Allah tells us that all the inhabitants of the earth will perish and die, as will all the inhabitants of heaven, except for whomsoever Allah wills, and nothing will be left except His Noble Face, for the Lord does not die, rather He is the Ever-Living who will never die. [Tafsir al-Quran il-‘Azeem] 
Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say, “Allahumma inni a’oodhu bi ‘izzatika la ilaha illa anta an tadillani, anta al-hayyu alladhi la yamoot wa’l-jinn wa’l-ins yamootoon (O Allah, I seek refuge in Your glory, there is no god but You, against being led astray, for You are the Ever-Living Who does not die, but the jinn and mankind will die).” 
With regard to your questions about where they are buried, whether the funeral prayer is offered for them and how long they live, these are matters which are concealed from us. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And of knowledge, you (mankind) have been given only a little.” [17:85] 
The Muslim should strive to learn more about that which has an impact on his own behaviour, such as knowledge of Allah, His names and attributes, what he is obliged to believe in and knowledge of the rulings of sharee’ah (Islamic law). He should avoid delving deeply into matters which he is not required to know and in which there is no benefit. I ask Allah to grant us beneficial knowledge and righteous deeds.

26075,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26075,He drinks alcohol on the basis that he is free to do whatever he wants,"I am a converted Muslim, my husband had been asked several times by his brother to have a drink with him and his friends. I couldn't confront him for the first time 'cause I don't want him to get upset. Until one day, I did asked him why he drinks (beer or whisky). His reason was,
1. I am the man of the house, I'll drink whenever I want;
2. I cannot say ""NO"" to my brother;
3. I need to socialize with them for connection and job promotion purposes (since the group he went with have higher positions where his working);
4. As long as I know to control myself even if I'm drinking and I am not doing anything bad. I couldn't imagine a Muslim man giving me this reasons. Please give me your opinion on this matter.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Who has guided you to Islam; we ask Him to make you steadfast in Islam and to complete His blessing upon you. 
Undoubtedly alcohol is haraam and is a major sin. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al‑Ansaab [stone altars for sacrifices to idols, jinn, etc], and Al‑Azlaam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytaan’s (Satan’s) handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.
Shaytaan (Satan) wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants (alcoholic drinks) and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allaah and from As‑Salaah (the prayer). So, will you not then abstain?”
[al-Maa'idah 5:90-91]
It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed ten people in connection with alcohol: the one who presses [the grapes, etc], the one for whom that is done, the one who drinks it, the one who carries it, the one to whom it is carried, the one who pours it, the one who sells it, the one who consumes its price, the one who buys it, and the one for whom it is bought.” 
(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1259; Ibn Maajah, 3381. Classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, no. 1041). 
It is not permissible for your husband to speak in this manner. This is not the response of a Muslim who must accept as forbidden that which Allaah has forbidden. It is not permissible for him to put obedience to his brother above obedience to Allaah, or to anger Allaah by pleasing his brother. If he adheres to the commands of Allaah, Allaah will protect him from his brother, but if he angers Allaah by giving precedence to pleasing his brother, Allaah will leave him to his brother. It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever pleases Allaah by angering the people, Allaah will be sufficient for him. But whoever angers Allaah by pleasing the people, Allaah will leave him to the people.”
(Narrated by Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh, 1/115; classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 2311) 
He can tell everyone – not just his brother – “No, this action is haraam.” 
Socializing with them for work purposes does not justify drinking alcohol. His saying that he is not doing anything wrong is very strange indeed. What does he call his drinking? Can we expect that his socializing with his brother and his friends does not involve anything other than alcohol? It is well known that such people will have women with them, and they will listen to music and ignore the prayers. All of these are major sins. 
You have to persist in advising him, keep on doing so and do not get tired of it. Look for someone whose advice will have an effect on him. 
Make a lot of du’aa’ asking that he be guided. We ask Allaah to guide us all to that which He loves and which pleases Him.
