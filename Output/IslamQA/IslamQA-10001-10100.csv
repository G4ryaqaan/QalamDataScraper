For more, see the detailed answer below.","Status of the family before Islam


Status of the family in the West


The status of women in the Muslim family 


Roles of members of the Muslim family","Praise be to Allah.Before we find out about the role of Islam in organizing and protecting the family, we should first find out what the situation of the family was before Islam, and what it is in the West in modern times. 
Status of the family before Islam
Before Islam, the family was based on mistreatment and oppression. All affairs were controlled only by men or in other words, the males, and women and girls were oppressed and humiliated. An example of that is that if a man died and left behind a wife, his son by another wife had the right to marry her and control her life, or to prevent her from getting married. Men were the only ones who could inherit; women and children had no share. They viewed women, whether they were mothers, daughters or sisters, as a source of shame, because they could be taken as prisoners, thus bringing shame upon the family. Hence a man would bury his infant daughter alive, as is referred to in the Qur’an, where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And when the news of (the birth of) a female (child) is brought to any of them, his face becomes dark, and he is filled with inward grief!
He hides himself from the people because of the evil of that whereof he has been informed. Shall he keep her with dishonour or bury her in the earth? Certainly, evil is their decision” [al-Nahl 16:58]
The family in the broader sense, i.e., the tribe, was based on supporting one another in all things, even in wrongdoing. 
When Islam came, it did away with all that and established justice, giving each person his or her rights, even nursing infants, and even the miscarried foetus who was to be respected and prayed for (i.e., given a proper funeral). 
Status of the family in the West
When you examine the family in the West today you will find that families are disintegrating and the parents cannot control their children, whether intellectually or morally. The son has the right to go wherever he wants and do whatever he wants; the daughter has the right to sit with whoever she wants and sleep with whoever she wants, all in the name of freedom and rights. And what is the result? Broken families, children born outside marriage, (elderly) mothers and fathers who are not looked after. As some wise men have said, if you want to know the true nature of these people, go to the prisons and the hospitals and seniors’ homes, for children do not remember their parents except on holidays and special occasions. The point is that many non-Muslims the institution of family is destroyed. 
The status of women in the Muslim family 
When Islam came it paid a great deal of attention to the establishment of strong families and protecting them from things that could harm them, and preserving family ties whilst giving each member of the family an important role in life. 
Islam honoured women, whether as mothers, daughters or sisters. It honoured women as mothers. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of Allah, who among people is most deserving of my good company?” He said, “Your mother.” He asked, “Then who?” He said, “Your mother.” He asked, “Then who?” He said, “Your mother.” He asked, “Then who?” He said, “Then your father.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5626; Muslim, 2548) 
Islam honours women as daughters. It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever has three daughters or three sisters, or two daughters or two sisters, and takes good care of them and fears Allah with regard to them, will enter Paradise.” (Narrated by Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh, 2/190) 
And Islam honours women as wives. It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of you are those who are best to their wives, and I am the best of you to my wives.” (Narrated and classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi, 3895). 
Islam gave women their rights of inheritance and other rights. It gave women rights like those of men in many spheres. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Women are the twin halves of men.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood in his Sunan, 236, from the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 216). 
Roles of members of the Muslim family
Islam encourages men to treat their wives well, and gives women the freedom to choose their husbands; it gives women much of the responsibility for raising the children. 
Islam gives fathers and mothers a great deal of responsibility for raising their children. It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, “Each of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. The leader is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. The man is the shepherd of his family and he is responsible for his flock. The woman is the shepherd of her husband’s household and is responsible for her flock. The servant is a shepherd of his master’s wealth and is responsible for his flock.” He said, I heard this from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).  (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 853; Muslim, 1829) 
Islam paid a great deal of attention to implanting the principle of respect for fathers and mothers, taking care of them and obeying their commands until death. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of honour” [al-Isra’ 17:23]
Islam protects the honour, chastity, purity and lineage of the family, so it encourages marriage and forbids free mixing of men and women. 
Islam gives each family member an important role to play. So fathers and mothers take care of the children and give them an Islamic upbringing; children are to listen and obey, and respect the rights of fathers and mothers, on a basis of love and respect. Even our enemies have borne witness to the strength of family ties among the Muslims.

Why can't a woman have multiple husbands simultaneously  in Islam?","Praise be to Allah.Belief in Allah dictates submission to His rulings and laws
This is connected primarily to faith in Allah. All religions agree that it is not permissible for a woman to have intercourse with anyone except her husband. Among these religions are those which are undoubtedly of heavenly origin, such as Islam and the original versions of Judaism and Christianity. 
Belief in Allah dictates submission to His rulings and laws, for Allah is All-Wise and All-Knowing, He knows what is in the best interests of mankind. So we may understand the wisdom behind the ruling of Shari`ah, or we may not be able to grasp it. 
Why can't a woman have multiple husbands simultaneously  in Islam?
With regard to the permissibility of multiple spouses for men and its prohibition for women , there are several issues which are obvious to every intelligent person. Allah has made a woman like a vessel, but man is not like that. If a woman becomes pregnant (when she has had intercourse with a number of men at one time), the father can never be known. People’s lines of descent and lineage will be mixed up, families will be destroyed and children will be lost. Women will be burdened with so many children that they will be unable to bring them up and spend on their maintenance. Maybe women would find themselves forced to sterilize themselves, which would lead to the extinction of the human race. 
Moreover it is medically proven now that one of the major causes of the serious diseases which have become widespread, such as AIDS etc., is women having intercourse with more than one man, and the mixing of seminal fluids in the woman’s womb causes these lethal diseases. Hence Allah has prescribed a waiting period (`Iddah) for a woman who has been divorced or whose husband has died , until enough time has passed for her womb and passages to be cleansed of any traces of her former husband, and the monthly period also has a role to play in this matter. 
Perhaps these brief pointers will dispense with the need for a lengthy discussion. If the purpose of the question is research for a university or other assignment, he may refer to the books which have been written on the topic of plural marriage (polygyny ) and the wisdom behind it.

10010,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10010,Adoption in Islam and Its Types,"If a person asks to adopt a child from the orphanage, is it permitted for those in charge to give him what he wants?","There are two types of adoption in Islam, forbidden and not forbidden. For more, please see the detailed answer.","Forbidden type of adoption


Permissible type of adoption


To whom should the adopted child be given?","Praise be to Allah.Forbidden type of adoption
Adoption in Islam of children is of two types, forbidden and not forbidden.
The forbidden type means adopting a child in the sense that the child is considered to be the child of the adopting parent and subject to the rulings on children . This is not permitted. Allah nullified it in the Quran when He said (interpretation of the meaning):
“…nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons…” [al-Ahzab 33:4]
Permissible type of adoption
The kind which is prescribed and may be mustahabb means being kind towards the child and giving him a righteous religious upbringing and sound direction, teaching him that which will benefit him in this world and the next. 
To whom should the adopted child be given?
But it is not permitted to hand a child over except to one who is known to be trustworthy, religiously-committed and of good character, who will take care of the child’s interests. He should also be a local resident, so that he will not take the child away to a country where his presence may be a cause for his religious commitment being lost in the future.
If these conditions are met in the case of both the child and the adopting parent, then it is OK to hand over a foundling whose parentage is not known. May Allah preserve you.

10011,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10011,Ruling on travelling to visit the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him),What is the ruling on travelling to visit the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and others graves of awliya’ and righteous people and others?,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to travel with the intention of visiting 
          the grave of the Prophet  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or the grave of any other person, 
          according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, because 
          the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) said: 
“No one should travel for the purpose of visiting (any mosque) except 
          three: al-Masjid al-Haraam (in Makkah), this mosque of mine (in Madeenah) 
          and al-Masjid al-Aqsaa (in al-Quds/Jerusalem).” Agreed upon).  
          
It is prescribed for the one who wants to visit the grave 
          of the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) and who lives far from Madeenah to have the intention 
          of travelling to visit al-Masjid al-Nabawi; that will include by implication 
          visiting the grave of the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), the graves of Abu Bakr 
          and ‘Umar, and the graves of the martyrs and people of al-Baqee’. 
If he has the intention of visiting both (the mosque and 
          the grave), this is permissible, because things may be permissible as 
          part of something else which are not permissible on their own. But having 
          the intention only to visit the grave and travelling for that purpose 
          is not permissible. Intending to visit the grave only is not permissible 
          if it involves travelling. But if a person lives close by and does not 
          need to travel, and his going to the grave is not regarded as “travel” 
          or a “journey”, then it is OK, because visiting the grave of the Prophet 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) and the graves of his two companions without having to 
          travel is Sunnah and is an act of worship. The same applies to visiting 
          the graves of the martyrs and of the people of al-Baqee’. Similarly, 
          visiting the graves of Muslims in all places is Sunnah and is an act 
          of worship, but without travelling for that purpose, because the Prophet 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) said: “Visit graves, for they will remind you of the Hereafter.” 
          (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh). 
          
The Prophet  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to teach his Sahaabah, when 
          they visited graves, to say, “Al-salaamu 
          ‘alaykum ahl al-diyaar min al-mu’mineen wa’l-Muslimeen, wa innaa in 
          shaa’ Allaah bikum laahiqoon, nas’al Allaaha lana wa lakum al-‘aafiyah

Literacy was not widespread among the Arabs 


The prohibition to write anything other than the Quran


The Prophetic order to write down the revelation


The Quran was revealed in seven dialects


How was the Quran compiled?


What was the Quran copy of ‘Uthman?","Praise be to Allah.Allah promised to preserve the Quran
Allah has guaranteed to preserve this Quran Himself . Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quran) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)” [al-Hijr 15:9]
Ibn Jareer al-Tabari said in his Tafseer, 14/8: 
“Allah is saying, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (Reminder), i.e. the Quran, and We will guard the Quran against anything false being added to it that is not part of it, or anything that is part of it being taken away, whether that has to do with rulings, hudood punishments or matters having to do with inheritance.” 
Al-Sa’di said in his Tafseer (p. 696): 
“It is We Who have sent down the Quran in which there is mention of all issues and clear evidence, and in which We remind those who want to be reminded.  
“and surely, We will guard it” means, when it is being revealed and after it has been revealed. When it is revealed, We protect it from the tampering of every accursed devil, and after it has been revealed Allah instilled it in the heart of His Messenger. Allah protected the words from being changed and from anything being added or taken away, or from its meanings being distorted. So no one can attempt to distort its meanings but Allah will guide someone to explain the truth of the Quran. This is one of the greatest signs of Allah and His blessing to His believing slaves. Another aspect of this protection is that Allah protects the people of the Quran against their enemies, and no enemy can overpower them and eliminate them.”  
The Quran was revealed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in stages over a period of twenty-three years. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (it is) a Quran which We have divided (into parts), in order that you might recite it to men at intervals. And We have revealed it by stages'' [al-Isra’ 17:106]
al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“This means, We have revealed this Quran in stages, to differentiate between guidance and misguidance, between truth and falsehood.
 “in order that you might recite it to men at intervals” means, slowly, so that they may ponder and think about its meanings, and understand the different branches of knowledge contained therein. 
“And We have revealed it by stages” means, gradually, over a period of twenty-three years.” Tafseer al-Sa’di, p. 760. 
Literacy was not widespread among the Arabs 
Literacy was not widespread among the Arabs. Allah described them in such terms when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger (Muhammad) from among themselves” [al-Jumu’ah 63:2]
They used to memorize the Quran by heart, and a few of them used to write down some verses or surahs on animal skins, thin white stones and the like. 
The prohibition to write anything other than the Quran
At first the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the writing of anything other than the Quran, and he forbade them to write down his words for a while, so that the Sahabah would focus on memorizing the Quran and writing it down, and so that the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would not be confused with the words of Allah, and so the Quran was protected from anything being added or taken away. 
The Prophetic order to write down the revelation
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) appointed a group of his Companions who were trustworthy and knowledgeable to write down the revelation . They are known in their biographies as those who wrote down the Revelation, such as the four Caliphs, ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As, Mu’awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan, Zayd ibn Thabit and others – may Allah be pleased with them all. 
The Quran was revealed in seven dialects
The Quran was revealed in seven dialects as was narrated in the saheeh hadeeth of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). This was narrated by al-Bukhari (2287) and Muslim (818); these were the dialects of the Arabs which were known for their eloquence. 
How was the Quran compiled?
The Quran continued to be preserved in the hearts of the Sahabah who had memorized it, and on the skins and other materials until the time of the caliph Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him). 
During the Riddah wars many of the Sahabah who had memorized the Quran were killed, and Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) was afraid that the Quran would be lost. So he consulted the senior Sahabah about compiling the Quran in a single book so that it would remain preserved and would not be lost. He entrusted this mission to the chief of memorizers Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him). Al-Bukhari narrated in his Saheeh (4986) that Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) said:  
Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq sent for me when the people of al-Yamamah had been killed [i.e., a number of the Prophet's Companions who fought against the false prophet Musaylimah]. (I went to him) and found ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab sitting with him. Abu Bakr then said (to me), “ ‘Umar has come to me and said: ‘Casualties were heavy among the Qurra of the Quran (i.e. those who knew the Quran by heart) on the day of the battle of al-Yamamah, and I am afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the Qurra on other battlefields, whereby a large part of the Quran may be lost. Therefore I suggest that you (Abu Bakr) order that the Quran be collected.” I said to 'Umar, ""How can you do something that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do?"" 'Umar said, ""By Allah, this is something good."" 'Umar kept on urging me to accept his proposal till Allah opened my heart to it and I began to realize the good in the idea which 'Umar had realized."" Then Abu Bakr said (to me). “You are a wise young man and we do not have any suspicion about you, and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). So search for (the fragmentary scripts of) the Quran and compile it in one book."" By Allah If they had ordered me to move one of the mountains, it would not have been heavier for me than this ordering me to compile the Quran. Then I said (to Abu Bakr), ""How can you do something that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do?"" Abu Bakr replied, ""By Allah, it is a good thing."" Abu Bakr kept on urging me to accept his idea until Allah opened my heart to that to which He had opened the hearts of Abu Bakr and 'Umar. So I started looking for the Quran and collecting it from (what it was written on) palm stalks, thin white stones and also from the men who knew it by heart, until I found the last Verse of Surah al-Taubah with Abu Khuzaymah al-Ansari, and I did not find it with anybody other than him. The verse is (interpretation of the meaning):  
""Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty...” [al-Taubah 9:128] until the end of Surat Bara'ah (i.e., al-Taubah).  
Then the complete manuscript (copy) of the Quran remained with Abu Bakr until he died, then with 'Umar until the end of his life, and then with Hafsah, the daughter of 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them). 
The Sahabi Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) knew the Quran by heart but he was methodical in his confirmation; he would not agree to write down any verse until two of the Sahabah testified that they had heard it from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).  
What was the Quran copy of ‘Uthman?
This Mus-haf (written copy of the Quran) remained in the hands of the caliphs until the time of the Rightly-Guided Caliph ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan (may Allah be pleased with him). The Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) had dispersed to different lands, and they used to recite the Quran according to what they had heard of the seven recitations from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and each of their students used to recite according to what he had heard from his shaykh.
If a student heard someone reciting in a manner different from what he knew, he would denounce him and accuse him of making a mistake, and this went on until the Sahabah feared that there would be fitnah (trouble) between the Tabi'een and successive generations. So they thought that they should unite the people in following one recitation, which was in the dialect of Quraysh in which the Quran had first been revealed, so as to dispel any disputes and resolve the matter. ‘Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him) was consulted, and he agreed with this opinion. 
Al-Bukhari narrated in his Saheeh (4988) from Anas ibn Malik that Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman came to ‘Uthman at the time when the people of Sham (Syria) and the people of Iraq were waging war to conquer Armenia and Azerbaijan. Hudhayfah was alarmed by their (the people of Sham and Iraq) differences in the recitation of the Quran, so he said to 'Uthman, ""O Ameer al-Mu’mineen! Save this nation before they dispute about the Book (Quran) as the Jews and the Christians did before."" So 'Uthman sent a message to Hafsah saying, ""Send us the manuscript of the Quran so that we may make copies of the Mus-haf and we will return the manuscript to you.""  
Hafsah sent it to 'Uthman. Then 'Uthman ordered Zayd ibn Thabit, 'Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr, Sa’eed ibn al-‘As and ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Harith ibn Hisham to copy out the manuscripts. 'Uthman said to the three men who were from Quraysh (the tribe of which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was a member), “In case you disagree with Zayd ibn Thabit on any point in the Quran, then write it in the dialect of Quraysh, for the Quran was revealed in their tongue."" They did so, and when they had written many copies, 'Uthman returned the original manuscripts to Hafsah.  
'Uthman sent to every Muslim province one copy of what they had copied, and ordered that all the other Quranic materials, whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies, be burnt.  
Ibn Shihab said: Kharijah ibn Zayd ibn Thabit told me that he heard Zayd ibn Thabit say: “When we made copies of the Mus-haf I missed a verse of al-Ahzab that I used to hear the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recite. So we searched for it and we found it with Khuzaymah ibn Taabit al-Ansari. (The verse was) ‘Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah’ [al-Ahzab 33:23 – interpretation of the meaning]. So we put it in its place in its surah in the Mus-haf.”
Thus an end was put to dispute and the Muslims were united. The Quran has remained and will remain narrated from generation to generation and preserved in men's hearts until the Day of Resurrection. This is how Allah has preserved His Book, in confirmation of the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quran) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)” [al-Hijr 15:9]

This question is for my paper of Western Civil class. What proof do you have that Gabriel spoke to Muhammad?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Jibreel (peace be upon him) spoke to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) directly, with no barrier in between, and the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw him in his true form. This was reported in many aayaat (verses of the Qur’aan) and ahaadeeth (reports of the things that the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said and did).
 1.Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
 “By the star when it goes down (or vanishes).
Your companion (Muhammad) has neither gone astray nor has erred.
Nor does he speak of (his own) desire.
It is only a Revelation revealed.
He has been taught (this Qur’aan) by one mighty in power [Jibreel (Gabriel)].”
[al-Najm 53:1-5]
 The mufassireen (commentators on the Qur’aan) have stated that what is meant by “one mighty in power” is Jibreel (peace be upon him), who taught Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) the Revelation. One of the ways in which Revelation happened is when the angel spoke directly to the Prophet. This indicates that Jibreel (peace be upon him) spoke to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). This idea is also supported by the aayahs (interpretation of the meaning):
 “And truly, this (the Qur’aan) is a revelation from the Lord of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists),
Which the trustworthy Rooh [Jibreel (Gabriel)] has brought down
Upon your heart (O Muhammad) that you may be (one) of the warners,
In the plain Arabic language”
[al-Shu’araa’ 26:192-195]
 “Say (O Muhammad): “Whoever is an enemy to Jibreel (Gabriel)(let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Qur’aan) down to your heart by Allaah’s Permission, confirming what came before it [i.e. the Tauraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] and guidance and glad tidings for the believers”

 2.The First Revelation, as is well known, happened when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was in seclusion in the cave of Hiraa’. Jibreel (peace be upon him) came to him and commanded him to read.It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah the Mother of the Believers (may Allaah be pleased with her) said:
“The first of the Wahy (Revelation) that came to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was seeing true dreams; he never saw any dream but it came true like the break of day. Then the love of seclusion was bestowed upon him. He used to go into seclusion in the cave of Hiraa’ where he would worship Allaah continuously for many nights, until he went back to see his family to collect more provisions. He would go back to Khadeejah, and take provisions with him for a similar number of nights. (This went on) until the truth came to him when he was in the cave of Hiraa’. The angels came to him and said, ‘Read!’ He said, ‘I am not a reader.’ He [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)] said: he embraced me and squeezed me so hard that I almost could bear it no longer, then he released me and said, ‘Read!’ I said, I am not a reader.’ Then he embraced me a second time and squeezed me so hard that I almost could bear it no longer, then he released me and said, ‘Read!’ I said, I am not a reader.’ Then he embraced me a third time and squeezed me so hard that I almost could bear it no longer, then he released me and said, ‘Read! In the Name of your Lord Who has created (all that exists). He has created man from a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood). Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous.’ [al-‘Alaq 96:1-3 – interpretation of the meaning]. Then the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came back with (the Revelation) and with his heart pounding wildly.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 3; Muslim, no. 231).
3.It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that al-Haarith ibn Hishaam (may Allaah be pleased with him) asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “O Messenger of Allaah, how does the Revelation come to you?” The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Sometimes it comes to me like the ringing of a bell, which is the hardest of all, then it passes once I have grasped what is said. And sometimes the angel comes to me in the form of a man and speaks to me, and I grasp what he says…” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 2).
4.The lengthy hadeeth about Jibreel, when he came in the form of a man, a stranger, and sat down with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and asked him about Islam, Eemaan (faith) and Ihsaan (goodness, perfection). The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) answered his questions, knowing that he was Jibreel. When he had finished asking his questions and had gone away, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told his companions that this was Jibreel, who had come to teach them their religion. See Saheeh al-Bukhaari, no. 48; Muslim, no. 9.
5.The reports about the Israa’ and Mi’raaj (Prophet’s night journey from Makkah to Jerusalem, and ascent from Jerusalem into the seven heavens). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked Jibreel questions, and Jibreel answered him. See Saheeh al-Bukhaari, no. 2968; Muslim, no. 238, and the ahaadeeth which tell the story of the Israa’ and Mi’raaj.
6.There are also many ahaadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) says, “Jibreel came to me and said…”, such as the hadeeth in which he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Jibreel (peace be upon him) came to me and said, ‘Whoever among your ummah (nation) dies notassociating anything with Allaah, will enter Paradise.’ I said, ‘Even if he does such and such?’ He said, ‘Yes.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 2213; Muslim, no. 137)
When the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came back from (the battle of) al-Khandaq, he and his companions put down their weapons and washed themselves. Jibreel came to him with his head covered with dust and said, “You have put down your weapons! By Allaah, I have not put down mine.” The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Where to?” He said, “Over there” – and pointed towards Bani Qurayzah. So the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) set out [to resume the campaign]. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 2602; Muslim, no. 3315).

How to discipline children


References on raising children in Islam","Praise be to Allah.Disciplining children is the duty of parents
Raising and educating children is one of the duties required of parents. Allah has enjoined that in the Quran, and the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also enjoined that. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allah, but do that which they are commanded” [Al-Tahrim 66:6]
Imam al-Tabari said, commenting on this verse: 
“Here Allah is saying: O you who believe in Allah and His Messenger, “Ward off yourselves” teach one another that which will protect those who do it from the Fire and ward it off from them, if it is done in obedience to Allah and they do it in obedience to Allah. The phrase “and your families against a Fire” means, and teach your families to do acts of obedience to Allah so that they may protect themselves from the Fire."" (Tafsir al-Tabari, 18/165 )
Al-Qurtubi said: 
“Muqatil said: This is a duty that he owes to himself, his children, his family and his male and female slaves. Ilkiya said: We have to teach our children and families religious commitment and goodness, and what they cannot do without of etiquette. This is what Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And enjoin As-Salah (the prayer) on your family, and be patient in offering them [i.e. the Sala (prayers)].” [Ta-Ha 20:132]
And Allah said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And warn your tribe (O Muhammad) of near kindred.” [Al-Shu’ara 26:214]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 
“And teach them (children) to pray when they are seven years old.”(Tafsir al-Qurtubi, 18/196 )
The Muslim – any Muslim – is a da’iyah (propagator) who calls people to Allah, so the first people whom he calls should be his children and family who are close to him. When Allah commanded His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to call people, He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And warn your tribe (O Muhammad) of near kindred.” [Al-Shu’ara 26:214] because they are the first people to whom he should do good and show mercy.  
The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave the parents the responsibility of raising the children and made that obligatory upon them. 
It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock. The ruler is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. A man is the shepherd of his family and is responsible for his flock. A woman is the shepherd of her husband’s household and is responsible for her flock. A servant is the shepherd of his master’s wealth and is responsible for his flock.” He said: and I think he said, “A man is the shepherd of his father’s wealth and is responsible for his flock. Each of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock.”  (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 583; Muslim, 1829) 
How to discipline children

Part of your duty is to bring them up from a young age to love Allah and His Messenger and to love the teachings of Islam. You should tell them that Allah has a Paradise and a Hell; that His Hell is hot and its fuel is men and stones. The following story contains an important lesson. 

Ibn al-Jawzi said: 
“There was a king who had a lot of wealth, and he had a daughter and no other children. He loved her very much, and he used to let her enjoy all kinds of entertainment. This went on for a long time. Beside the king there lived a devoted worshipper, and whilst he was reciting one night, he raised his voice saying, “O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones” [Al-Tahrim 66:6 – interpretation of the meaning]. 
The girl heard his recitation and said to her servants, “Stop!” But they did not stop. The worshipper started to repeat the verse, and the girl kept telling them to stop, but they did not stop. She put her hands to her collar and tore her garment, and they went to her father and told him the story. He went to her and said, “My dear, what happened to you tonight? What made you weep?” and he hugged her. She said, “I ask you by Allah, O my father, to tell me, does Allah have a Fire the fuel of which is men and stones?” He said, “Yes.” She asked him, “Why did you not tell me? By Allah I will not eat any good food or sleep on any soft bed until I know whether my abode is in Paradise or Hell.” (Safwat al-Safwah, 4/437-438 )

You have to keep them away from the places of immorality and misguidance; do not leave them to grow up with evil things from the television etc, then after that expect them to be righteous, for whoever sows thorns cannot harvest grapes.  That should be done when they are young, so that it will be easy for them when they grow up, and they will get used to it, and it will be easy for you to tell them what to do and what not to do, and it will be easy for them to obey you. 

It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Teach your children to pray when they are seven years old, and smack them (lightly) if they do not do so when they are ten, and separate them in their beds.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 495; classed as sahih (authentic) by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 5868)

But the educator must be merciful, forbearing, easy-going and approachable, not foul-mouthed or unkempt, arguing in a manner that is better, far removed from insulting, rebuking and beating, unless the child is one of those who willfully disobey and rejects his father’s commands and neglects his duties and does haram (impermissible) things; in that case it is better to use stern measures with him, without causing him harm. 

Al-Minawi said: 
“For a father to discipline his child when he reaches the age of discernment means that he should raise him with the characteristics of the righteous believers and protect him from mixing with evildoers; he should teach him the Quran and good manners and the language of the Arabs, let him hear the Sunnah (Prophetic traditions) and the sayings of the Salaf (pious predecessors) and teach him the religious rulings that he cannot do without. He should warn him then smack him (lightly) if he does not pray etc. That will be better for him than giving a sa’ (dry measure of food) in charity, because if he teaches him properly, his actions will be among his ongoing charity, whereas the reward for a sa’ of charity is limited, but that will last as long as the child lives. Discipline is the nourishment of the soul, and training it for the Hereafter.  
“O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell)…” [Al-Tahrim 66:6 – interpretation of the meaning]
Protecting yourself and your family from it means reminding them of Hell. Discipline includes preaching, warning, threatening, smacking (lightly, if necessary), detaining, giving and being kind. Disciplining one who is good and noble is different from disciplining one who is difficult and ignoble."" (Fayd al-Qadir, 5/257) 

Smacking (lightly) is a means of correcting the child; it is not something that is wanted in and of itself, rather it is resorted to if the child is stubborn and disobedient. 

There is a system of punishment in Islam, and there are many punishments in Islam, such as the hadd punishments for adultery, theft, slander, etc. All of these are prescribed in order to set the people straight and put a stop to their evil. 
Concerning such matters the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) advised parents to deter their children from doing wrong. 
It was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Hang your whip where the members of the household can see it, for that will discipline them.”  (Narrated by al-Tabarani, 10/248; its isnad was classed as hasan by al-Haythami in Majma’ al-Zawaid, 8/106)
Al-Albani said in Sahih al-Jami’, 4022, it is hasan (good). 

So raising children should be a balance between encouragement and warning. The most important element of all is making the environment in which the children live a good one, by providing the means whereby they may be guided; this means that their educators should be religiously committed, including their parents. 
One of the ways in which a parent may be successful in raising his children is to use a cassette player to play tapes of teachings, Quran recitation, khutbahs (sermons)and lessons of scholars, for there are many available.

Why Qul Huwallahu Ahad  is equivalent to one-third of the Quran","Praise be to Allah.Hadiths about Qul Huwallahu Ahad being one-third of the Quran
There follow some of the ahadith narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which state that Surat al-Ikhlas (Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad) is equivalent to one-third of the Quran.
 Al-Bukhari (6643) narrated from Abu Sa’id that a man heard another man reciting Qul Huwallahu Ahad and repeating it. The next morning he came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him about that. The man thought that it was too little, but the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, it is equivalent to one-third of the Quran.”
Muslim (811) narrated from Abu’l-Darda that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Is any one of you unable to recite one-third of the Quran in one night?” They said, “How could anyone read one-third of the Quran?” He said, “Qul Huwallahu Ahad is equivalent to one-third of the Quran.”
 Muslim (812) narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Gather together, for I will recite to you one-third of the Quran.” So those who could gather together gathered there, then the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came out and recited Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad, then he went in. They said to one another, perhaps there has been some news from heaven on account of which he has gone inside (the house). Then the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came out and said, “I told you that I was going to recite to you one-third of the Quran. Verily it is equivalent to one-third of the Quran.” 
The bounty of Allah is immense 
The bounty of Allah is immense, and Allah has bestowed His bounty upon this ummah and has made up for its short life span by giving it more reward for simple deeds. It is strange that with some people, instead of this motivating them to do more good, this makes them apathetic and lazy in doing acts of worship, or they feel that this bounty and reward is strange and farfetched.
How Qul Huwallahu Ahad  is equivalent to one-third of the Quran
There is a difference between jaza (reward) and ijza (what is sufficient). What is making the brother confused is that he does not see the difference between them.
 Jaza means the reward which Allah gives for obeying Him.
 Ijza means what is sufficient and takes the place of something else.
Reciting Qul Huwallahu Ahad brings a reward equivalent to reciting one-third of the Quran, but it does not take the place of reading one-third of the Quran.
 If a person vows – for example – to read one-third of the Quran, it is not sufficient for him to read Qul Huwallahu Ahad, because it is equivalent to one-third of the Quran in reward, but not in terms of being sufficient or taking the place of reading one-third of the Quran.
 The same may be said of reciting it three times. If a person recites it three times in his prayer,  that does not mean that he does not have to recite al-Fatihah, even though he will be given the reward of reciting the whole Quran.
 A similar example is the reward given by the Lawgiver to one who offers a single prayer in the Sanctuary of Makkah, and that he will have the reward of one hundred thousand prayers. Does anyone take this divine bounty to mean that he does not have to pray for decades because he offered a single prayer in the Haram that is equivalent to one hundred thousand prayers?
 Rather this has to do with reward; as for what is sufficient, that is another matter altogether.
 Moreover, none of the scholars has ever said that there is no need for us to read the Quran or that Qul Huwallah Ahad is sufficient and takes the place of that. 
Why Qul Huwallahu Ahad  is equivalent to one-third of the Quran 
The correct scholarly view is that this surah has this great virtue because the Quran deals with three topics: one-third for rulings, one-third for promises and warnings, and one-third for the Divine names and attributes.
 This surah combines names and attributes.
 This is the view of Abu’l-‘Abbas ibn Surayj, and Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah stated that it was good in Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 17/103.
 The Muslim cannot do without the two other issues, which are the rulings and the promises and warnings. His knowledge cannot be complete unless he looks at the Book of Allah as a whole. The one who stops at Surat al-Ikhlas cannot know the other two matters.
 Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah – may Allah have mercy on him) said:
""Rewards are of different types, just as wealth is of different types, such as food, drink, clothing, houses, money and so on. If a man possesses one type of wealth, to the value of one thousand dinars, that does not mean that he can do without the other types. Rather if he has wealth in the form of food, he also needs clothing and a place to live, etc. Similarly if it is a type other than money, he still needs other things. If he has nothing but money, he will need all kinds of wealth that are usually needed. In al-Fatihah there are the benefits of praise and du’a which people need, and Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad cannot replace it in that sense. Although its reward is very great, he cannot benefit from it unless he also recites the Opening of the Book (al-Fatihah) in his prayer. Hence if a person recites only Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad in his prayer, without al-Fatihah, his prayer is not valid. Even if he recited the whole of the Quran without al-Fatihah, his prayer would not be valid, because al-Faatihah refers to the basic needs that people cannot do without.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 17/131)
 And he said:
“The people need the commands, prohibitions and stories that are in the Quran, even though Tawhid is greater than that. Man needs to know what he is enjoined to do and what he is forbidden to do; he needs to know what is enjoined upon him and the stories and promises and rewards. These cannot be replaced by anything else, and Tawhid cannot be replaced by these. The stories cannot take the place of the commands and prohibitions, and the commands and prohibitions cannot take the place of the stories. Rather everything that was sent down by Allah is beneficial and people need it.
 If a person recites Qul Huwallahu Ahad, he earns a reward equivalent to the reward of one-third of the Quran, but that does not mean that the reward is of the same kind as that earned by reading the rest of the Quran. Rather he may need the kind of reward that comes from reading the commands and prohibitions and stories, so Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad cannot take the place of all that.”  
And he said:
“The knowledge that is to be gained by reading the rest of the Quran cannot be gained by reciting this surah only. So whoever reads the whole Quran is better than one who simply recites this surah three times in the sense that he earns different kinds of reward, even though the one who recites Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad earns a reward equivalent to that reward, but it is of one type and does not include all the types that a person needs. This is like a man who has three thousand dinars and another who has food, clothing, accommodation and money equivalent to three thousand dinars.  The latter has that which will benefit him in all his affairs, whereas the former needs what the latter has, even though what he has is equivalent in value. Similarly, if he has the finest food, equivalent to three thousand dinars in value, he still needs clothing and accommodation, and weapons and tools that will ward off harm from him, and the like, which cannot be done with food alone.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 17/137-139)

          But if his anger was so intense that he was not really aware, then the 
          vow is not binding, because it is essential that he is aware of what 
          he is saying. So if his anger was so intense that it made him unaware 
          of what he was saying, and he was out of control, then in this case 
          he does not have to offer kafaarah, 
          like one who is insane, feeble-minded or asleep.  
He can forego doing what he vowed to do, if he thinks that 
          that is in his best interests, and he can offer expiation for his vow, 
          because the Prophet  (peace and 
          blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If you make a vow, then you 
          see that doing something else is better than that, offer expiation for 
          your vow and do that which is better.” (Saheeh – agreed upon). 
So if he vowed not to visit someone, then he sees that 
          it is better to visit him, he should visit him and offer expiation for 
          his vow, and so on. 
It does not matter whether he offers the expiation before 
          or after doing the alternative action. 
And Allaah is the sources of strength.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 8, p. 392"
10029,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10029,Is it permissible to give the reward of an action to someone who offered sacrifices to someone other than Allaah out of ignorance?,"According to what he has been told, his father offered sacrifices to someone other than Allaah. Now he wants to offer charity on his father’s behalf and perform Hajj on his behalf, and he blames his father’s falling into that (sin) on the fact that there were no scholars or teachers to advise him. What is the ruling on all of that?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If his father is known to have been a good and righteous 
          Muslim, he should not believe anything that he is told to the contrary 
          by those who  are not of sound character. It is Sunnah for him 
          to make du’aa’ for him and to give charity on his behalf, unless he 
          knows for sure that his father died in shirk. 
          That knowledge would come about if he has the testimony of two or more 
          sound witnesses who can testify that they saw him offering a sacrifice 
          to someone other than Allaah, such as the occupant of a grave, etc., 
          or heard him calling upon anyone other than Allaah. If that happens, 
          then he should refrain from making du’aa’ for him, and his case rests 
          with Allaah, because the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked his Lord for permission 
          to pray for forgiveness for his mother, and Allaah did not give him 
          permission, although she had died during the Jaahiliyyah as a follower 
          of the religion of the kuffaar. Then he asked his Lord for permission 
          to visit her grave, and He gave him permission. That indicates that 
          whoever dies in shirk, 
          even if he is ignorant, we cannot make du’aa’ for him, or pray for forgiveness 
          for him, or give charity on his behalf, or perform Hajj on his behalf.

10032,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10032,Claims of divinity,"There are a couple of psuedo islamic sects of the Nation of Islam (the cult of Elijah Muhammad) that believe in anthroporphism. Some of his followers have even named themselves ""Allah"". They even try to use a Qadiyani translation of the Quran to try and prove their beliefs.  How can I refute the Man-god beliefs by using the Quran and Sunnah? Not only for the ""nation of kufr"", but for the christians also.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
We should note that the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us that this ummah would become divided. 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah 
    be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Jews split into seventy-one or 
    seventy-two sects, and the Christians split likewise. My ummah will split into seventy-three sects.” According to a report narrated by Ibn Maajah 
    (3993), from the hadeeth of Anas, “… all of whom will be in the Fire apart from one.” 
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2640. Abu ‘Eesa 
    al-Tirmidhi said: The hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. It was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah, 
    3227. 
Once this is understood, the saved and victorious group is one and it is the group that adheres 
    to the Qur’aan and Sunnah inwardly and outwardly. 
Secondly: 
The one who makes a claim to divine lordship 
    is a worse kaafir than the pre-Islamic mushrik Arabs to whom the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was sent. The mushrikoon 
    in the Jaahiliyyah used to believe that Allaah was the Creator and Provider, the Giver of life and death. The evidence for that is the verse in 
    which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if you (O Muhammad) ask them: ‘Who 
    has created the heavens and the earth,’ they will certainly say: ‘Allaah’”
[Luqmaan 31:25]
Yet despite that Allaah did not say that they 
    were not mushriks and kaafirs, because they denied Tawheed al-‘Uboodiyyah (Oneness of worship), which means worshipping Allaah alone. They 
    used to prostrate to “deities” other than Allaah and offer sacrifices to “deities” other than Allaah; they associated idols in worship with Allaah 
    and they thought that they (the idols) could bring benefit or cause harm instead of Allaah. Hence Allaah tells us that they said, 
“ ‘Has he made the aalihah (gods) (all) 
    into One Ilaah (God — Allaah). Verily, this is a curious thing!’”
[Saad 38:5 – interpretation of the 
    meaning]
And Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“And those who take Awliyaa’ (protectors, 
    helpers, lords, gods) besides Him (say): ‘We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allaah’”
    [al-Zumar 39:3]
 This indicates that the kufr of the mushrik 
    Arabs was less serious than the kufr of those mentioned in the question, because the mushrik Arabs affirmed the Oneness of divine Lordship (Tawheed 
    al-Ruboobiyyah) whereas these people deny it. 
Allaah has refuted in the Qur’aan the specious arguments of those who lay claim to divine 
    lordship. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Had there been therein (in the heavens 
    and the earth) aalihah (gods) besides Allaah, then verily, both would have been ruined”
[al-Anbiya’ 21:22] 
“No son (or offspring) did Allaah beget, 
    nor is there any ilaah (god) along with Him. (If there had been many gods), then each god would have taken away what he had created, and some 
    would have tried to overcome others! Glorified be Allaah above all that they attribute to Him!”
[al-Mu’minoon 23:91]
The story of the arguments that Ibraaheem 
    (peace be upon him) used against those who made claims of divine lordship shows us the best way of arguing against them. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Have you not looked at him who disputed 
    with Ibraaheem (Abraham) about his Lord (Allaah), because Allaah had given him the kingdom? When Ibraaheem (Abraham) said (to him): ‘My Lord 
    (Allaah) is He Who gives life and causes death.’ He said, ‘I give life and cause death.’ Ibraaheem (Abraham) said, ‘Verily, Allaah brings the sun 
    from the east; then bring it you from the west.’ So the disbeliever was utterly defeated. And Allaah guides not the people, who are Zaalimoon 
    (wrongdoers)”
[al-Baqarah 2:258]
 So follow this example and say to the one 
    who makes claims of divine lordship, “If what you are saying is true, then let him bring the sun from the west, or bring the dead back to life, or 
    cause rain to fall from the sky, or bring forth crops from the earth.” 
Fourthly: 
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) has told us that the Dajjaal who will emerge at the end of time will claim to be divine. The Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) has told us the sign by which we may know that his claim to be God is false. This sign is that the Dajjaal will be 
    one-eyed, blind in his right eye. 
It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood up to address the people. He praised Allaah 
    as He deserves to be praised, then he mentioned the Dajjaal and said: “I warn you of him, and there is no Prophet who did not warn his people of 
    him. Nooh warned his people, but I am warning you in words that no other Prophet has said to his people. You should know that he (the Dajjaal) is 
    one-eyed and Allaah is not one-eyed.” (narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2892; Muslim, 169). 
This sign will be obvious to everyone who 
    sees it. If this Dajjaal was the Lord Who brought this universe into being with all its beauty, He would be able to remove that ugliness from 
    himself and remove that blindness from his eye. 
Allaah, Who created this universe and created 
    man with his wondrous harmony and perfect shape, must inevitably be absolutely perfect with no shortcomings or imperfections of any sort 
    whatsoever. 
Signs of imperfection are obvious in those 
    who makes claims of divine lordship; they sleep, fall sick, suffer pain, suffer discomfort in heat and cold, need food and drink. Any one of them 
    carries impurities (najaasah) within himself and needs to go to the lavatory one or twice a day! Are such people fit to be called gods?  Glory be 
    to You (O Allaah)! This is a great lie (cf. al-Noor 24:16). 
It is not strange that they make this claim; what is really strange is that they have followers 
    who agree with what they say. 
Fifthly: 
The Muslim must realize that these sects – 
    such as the group mentioned, and the Qadianis, Baha’is and other misguided groups – were only established to fight Islam and lead its people away 
    from it. It does not take much effort to demonstrate that they are misguided and false. The Muslim should beware of them and warn other Muslims 
    against these misguided groups. 
Sixthly: 
With regard to refuting the religion of the 
    Christians, it does not require much effort. All that is needed to refute them is the following words of Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on 
    him): 
O worshippers of the Messiah, we have a 
    question, to which we want an answer from the one who understands it.
If a god dies because of the actions of 
    people who kill him, what is this god?
Is he pleased with what they did to him? Then 
    they must be lucky for they have earned his pleasure.
If he is displeased with what they did to 
    him, their power has nevertheless overwhelmed his.
Did the universe remain without a god who 
    hears all and answers those who call upon him?
Were the seven heavens left with no god above 
    them when he was buried in the ground? 
Was this universe left with no god to look 
    after it when his hands were nailed (to the cross)?
How could this god be forsaken by all his 
    creation when they heard him weep?
How could this wood bear the true god who was 
    tied to it?
How could iron come close to him and 
    penetrate him and wound him?
How could the hands of his enemies reach him 
    when they struck the back of his head?
Was the Messiah brought back to life or is 
    the one who revived him another god?
What a strange grave it is that could contain 
    a god. What is even stranger is that a womb could contain him,
Where he remained for nine months, nourished 
    from blood,
Then he emerged from the vagina as a tiny 
    baby, opening his mouth and seeking the breast,
Eating and drinking, with the inevitable 
    consequences thereof. Is that a god?
Exalted be Allaah above the fabrications of 
    the Christians. He will question them all about the lies they told.
O worshippers of the cross, for what reason 
    is that thing (the cross) venerated?
Rationally speaking, it should be broken and 
    burned.
If god was crucified upon it by force and his 
    hands nailed to it,
Then the thing used for that purpose should 
    be cursed and trampled upon, not kissed when you see it.
How can the Lord of the Worlds be humiliated 
    on it, then you go and worship it? 
Then you are the enemies of that god, if you 
    venerate it because the lord of mankind has touched it.
That cross is lost but every time we see 
    something similar it reminds us of that cross.
Then why you do you not venerate the graves, 
    for a grave once contained your lord?
O worshipper of the Messiah, wake up! He has 
    a beginning and he has an end.

“And 
          no moving (living) creature is there on earth but its provision is due 
          from Allaah” [Hood 
          11:6] 
 “And 
          so many a moving (living) creature carries not its own provision! Allaah 
          provides for it and for you. And He is the All‑Hearer, the All‑Knower” 
          [al-‘Ankaboot 
          29:60] 
 “Verily, 
          Allaah is the All‑Provider, Owner of Power, the Most Strong” [al-Dhaariyaat 
          51:58] 
 “so 
          seek your provision from Allaah (Alone), and worship Him (Alone), and 
          be grateful to Him”
[al-‘Ankaboot 
          29:17] 
 Allaah condemned the people of the Jaahiliyyah 
          who killed their children for fear of poverty, and He forbade doing 
          what they did. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And 
          kill not your children for fear of poverty. We shall provide for them 
          as well as for you. Surely, the killing of them is a great sin” [al-Israa’ 
          17:31] 
 Allaah has commanded His slaves to put 
          their trust in Him in all their affairs, and He is Sufficient for those 
          who put their trust in Him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
          
 “and 
          put your trust in Allaah if you are believers indeed” [al-Maa’idah 5:23] 
          
 “And 
          whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him” [al-Talaaq 
          65:3]. 
 So you have to put your trust in your 
          Lord and believe that He will provide for you and your children. Do 
          not let the fear of poverty prevent you from seeking to have children, 
          for Allaah has guaranteed provision for all. By not wanting children 
          for fear of poverty, you are imitating the people of the Jaahiliyyah.
 You should also note that taking out 
          loans with interest is ribaa (usury), for which Allaah issues the warning 
          of a painful torment. It is one of the seven sins which condemn a person 
          to Hell. The Prophet  (peace and 
          blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Avoid the seven sins  which 
          condemn a person to Hell…[which include] consuming ribaa.” And he  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah has cursed 
          the one who consumes ribaa, the one who pays it…” Consumption of ribaa 
          is one of the greatest causes of poverty and loss of blessings, as Allaah 
          says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 “Allaah 
          will destroy Ribaa and will give increase for Sadaqaat (deeds of charity, 
          alms)” [al-Baqarah 2:276]
 I think that you do 
          not know the ruling on interest-based loans. So seeks Allaah’s forgiveness 
          for what is in the past, and do not do it again. Wait for your Lord 
          to grant you a way out and seek provision from Him. Put your trust in

10034,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10034,Is Iblees still alive?,"If Jinns live and die, would that mean Iblis died or is still alive?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is the way of Allaah in His creation of man 
          to test him and try him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
          
“that Allaah might test what is in your breasts; and to purify 
          that which was in your hearts (sins), and Allaah is All-Knower 
          of what is in (your) breasts” 
[Aal 
          ‘Imraan 3:154] 
 One of the things with which Allaah tests us is Iblees (may Allaah 
          curse him). Allaah has made him one of those who are given respite, 
          blocking the way of good and commanding evil, forbidding what is good 
          and enjoining what is evil. There are those who believe him; many people 
          among the sons of Adam follow him; he is misled and he misleads others. 
          Iblees vowed to do that, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
          
“And 
          (remember) when We said to the angels: ‘Prostrate yourselves unto Adam.’ 
          They prostrated themselves except Iblees (Satan). He said: ‘Shall I 
          prostrate myself to one whom You created from clay?’ 
[Iblees 
          (Satan)] said: ‘See this one whom You have honoured above me, if You 
          give me respite (keep me alive) to the Day of Resurrection, I will surely, 
          seize and mislead his offspring (by sending them astray) all but a few!’ 
          
(Allaah) 
          said: ‘Go, and whosoever of them follows you, surely, Hell will be the 
          recompense of you (all)   
          an ample recompense. 
And 
          befool them gradually those whom you can among them with your voice 
          (i.e. songs, music, and any other call for Allaah’s disobedience), make 
          assaults on them with 
          your cavalry and your infantry, share 
          with them wealth and children (by tempting them to earn money by illegal 
          ways   
          usury, or by committing illegal sexual intercourse), and make promises 
          to them.” But Satan promises them nothing but deceit. 
Verily, 
          My slaves (i.e. the true believers of Islamic Monotheism) — you have 
          no authority over them. And All-Sufficient is your Lord as a Guardian.’” 
          
[al-Israa’ 
          17:60-65] 
“And 
          surely, We created you (your father Adam) and then gave you shape (the 
          noble shape of a human being); then We told the angels, ‘Prostrate yourselves 
          to Adam’, and they prostrated themselves, except Iblees (Satan), he 
          refused to be of those who prostrated themselves. 
(Allaah) 
          said: ‘What prevented you (O Iblees) that you did not prostrate yourself, 
          when I commanded you?’ Iblees said: ‘I am better than him (Adam), You 
          created me from fire, and him You created from clay.’ 
(Allaah) 
          said: ‘(O Iblees) get down from this (Paradise), it is not for you to 
          be arrogant here. Get out, for you are of those humiliated and disgraced.’ 
          
(Iblees) 
          said: ‘Allow me respite till the Day they are raised up (i.e. the Day 
          of Resurrection).’ 
(Allaah) 
          said: ‘You are of those respited.’ 
(Iblees) 
          said: ‘Because You have sent me astray, surely, I will sit in wait against 
          them (human beings) on Your straight path. 
Then 
          I will come to them from before them and behind them, from their right 
          and from their left, and You will not find most of them as thankful 
          ones (i.e. they will not be dutiful to You).’
(Allaah) 
          said (to Iblees): ‘Get out from this (Paradise), disgraced and expelled. 
          Whoever of them (mankind) will follow you, then surely, I will fill 
          Hell with you all.’” 
[al-A’raaf 
          7:11-18]
 From the apparent meaning of these aayaat and others, it is clear 
          that Allaah has delayed the death of Iblees (may Allaah curse him) until 
          an appointed time. Allaah has postponed his death until a day that is 
          known to Him, which no one else knows. Iblees asked Allaah to give him 
          respite, as Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“[Iblees 
          (Satan)] said: ‘My Lord! Give me then respite till the Day the (dead) 
          are resurrected.’ 
(Allaah) 
          said: ‘Verily, you are of those allowed respite 
Till 
          the Day of the time appointed.’” [Saad 
          38:79-81] 
 The scholars differed concerning the phrase “Till 
          the Day of the time appointed”: 
·Some said that this means the Day of Resurrection, at the second blast of the 
          Trumpet. 
·Some said that it means the decreed lifespan of Iblees. 
 Most of the scholars said that what is meant by “the 
          Day of the time appointed” is the day when all creatures 
          will die, at the time of the first blast of the Trumpet, not the second 
          blast. They said: because after the Resurrection – at the second blast 
          of the Trumpet – there will be no more death. Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning): 
“And 
          the Trumpet will be blown, and all who are in the heavens and all who 
          are on the earth will swoon away, except him whom Allaah wills. Then 
          it will be blown a second time, and behold they will be standing, looking 
          on (waiting)” 
[al-Zumar 
          39:68] 
 Al-Baydaawi said in his Tafseer: 
          
“Till the Day of the time appointed” 
          means, the time appointed for you with Allaah, or when all people will 
          die, which is at the first blast of the Trumpet, according to the majority. 
          
(Tafseer al-Baydaawi, 3/370) 
          
 Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his tafseer 
          of this aayah: 
Ibn 
          ‘Abbaas said: What He meant by this is the first blast of the Trumpet, 
          i.e., when all creatures will die. Or it was said, the appointed time, 
          the knowledge of which Allaah has kept to Himself and which Iblees does 
          not know. So Iblees will die and then be resurrected. Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning):
“Whatsoever 
          is on it (the earth) will perish” 
[al-Rahmaan 
          55:26] 
(Tafseer al-Qurtubi,10/27) 
          
 Al-Tabari narrated 
          in his Tafseer  from 
          al-Suddi: 
“[Iblees 
          (Satan)] said: ‘My Lord! Give me then respite till the Day the (dead) 
          are resurrected.’
(Allaah) 
          said: ‘Verily, you are of those allowed respite 
Till 
          the Day of the time appointed.’” 
[Saad 
          38:79-81 – interpretation of the meaning] 
He did not give him respite until the Day of Resurrection, 
          but rather until the day of the time appointed, which is the day when 
          the first blast of the Trumpet will be given and everyone who is in 
          the heavens and on earth will swoon and then die. (8/132) 
 Imaam al-Shawkaani said in his tafseer of 
          this aayah: 
Till 
          the Day of the time appointed.’” 
[Saad 
          38:79-81 – interpretation of the meaning]
The day which Allaah has decreed for the death 
          of all creatures, which is when the last blast of the Trumpet will be 
          sounded, or it was said the first blast. It was said that Iblees asked 
          to be given a respite until the Day of Resurrection so that he might 
          avoid death, because if he were given respite until the Day of Resurrection, 
          he would not die before the resurrection; when the resurrection came, 
          he would thus have avoided death. But Allaah responded in a manner that 
          denied him his desire and thwarted his aims, which was by giving him 
          respite until the day of the time appointed, which is known only to 
          Allaah, and no one else knows it. 
(Fath al-Qadeer, 4/446) 
 This indicates that Iblees (may Allaah curse 
          him) is still alive and that he is still spreading mischief on earth 
          and misguiding people away from the path of Allaah. But he is not immortal 
          and will not live until the Day of Resurrection, rather there is an 
          appointed time when he will die – and Allaah knows best when that appointed 
          time will be. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Everyone shall taste death” 
[Aal 
          ‘Imraan 3:185] 
“Whatsoever 
          is on it (the earth) will perish. 
And 
          the Face of your Lord full of Majesty and Honour will remain forever” 
          
[al-Rahmaan 
          55:26-27]
There are also reports which indicate that Iblees 
          (may Allaah curse him) was alive at the time of the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): 
·Iblees appeared on the day of Badr in the form of Suraaqah 
          ibn Maalik. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) when Shaytaan (Satan) made their (evil) deeds 
          seem fair to them and said, ‘No one of mankind can overcome you this 
          day (of the battle of Badr) and verily, I am your neighbour (for each 
          and every help).’ But when the two forces came in sight of each other, 
          he ran away and said ‘Verily, I have nothing to do with you. Verily, 
          I see what you see not. Verily, I fear Allaah for Allaah is Severe in 
          punishment’” 
[al-Anfaal 
          8:48] 
Ibn Katheer said in his 
          tafseer of this aayah:
He (may Allaah curse him) made attractive to them the reason why they 
          came and what 
          they wanted to do. He raised their hopes that they would not be overwhelmed 
          by anybody on that day, and calmed their fears that their homes might 
          be attacked by their enemies Banu Bakr. He said, “and verily, I am your 
          neighbour (for each and every 
          help)” 
          – because he appeared in the form of Suraaqah ibn Maalik ibn Ja’sham, 
          the leader of Banu Mudlij and the leader of that region. All of that 
          came from him, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He (the Shaytaan) makes promises to them, and arouses in them false desires; 
          and Shaytaan’s promises are nothing but deceptions.” [al-Nisaa’ 4:120] 
          
 Ibn Juraij said: Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah 
          be pleased with him) said concerning this aayah: When the day of Badr 
          came, Iblees marched with his flags and his troops alongside the mushrikeen, 
          and gave the mushrikeen the notion that no one would defeat them and 
          that he was their neighbour. But when the (enemies) met in battle, and 
          the Shaytaan saw the angelic reinforcements (on the Muslims’ side), 
          he ran away, i.e., he turned on his heels and fled, saying, Verily, 
          I see what you see not… (Tafseer 
          Ibn Katheer, 2/318) 
·He also (may Allaah curse him) appeared on the day of 
          Uhud. It was reported in a saheeh hadeeth that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah 
          be pleased with him) said: On the day of Uhud, the mushrikeen were defeated. 
          Then Iblees shouted out, ‘O slaves of Allaah! Beware the ones behind 
          you!’ So the front ranks attacked the ones behind. Hudhayfah looked 
          and saw his father al-Yamaan. He cried out, ‘O slaves of Allaah, my 
          father, my father!’ By Allaah, they did not stop until they killed him 
          [al-Yamaan]. Hudhayfah said, ‘May Allaah forgive you.’ ‘Urwah [one of 
          the narrators] said: By Allaah, because of this, Hudhayfah remained 
          in a good state until he met Allaah [i.e., died]. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 
          no. 3047) 
·It was narrated in the saheeh ahaadeeth that the Prophet 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) saw Iblees. It was narrated in a saheeh hadeeth that Abu’l-Dardaa’ 
          (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood up, and we heard him 
          say: “I seek refuge in Allaah from you.” Then he said: “I curse you 
          with the curse of Allaah” three times, and he spread out his hand as 
          if reaching for something. When the prayer was over, we said, “O Messenger 
          of Allaah, we heard you saying something in the prayer that we have 
          never heard you say before, and we saw you stretching out your hand.” 
          He said, “The enemy of Allaah Iblees came with a flame of fire to throw 
          in my face, and I said, ‘I seek refuge with Allaah from you’ three times. 
          Then I said, ‘I curse you with the complete curse of Allaah’ three times, 
          but he did not retreat. Then I wanted to seize him. By Allaah, were 
          it not for the prayer of our brother Sulaymaan, he would have been tied 
          up this morning and the children of the people of Madeenah would have 
          played with him.” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 843; al-Nasaa’i, no. 1200) 
          
 It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri 
          that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed Subh (Fajr) prayer and he 
          [Abu Sa’eed] was behind him. He recited and got confused in his recitation. 
          When the prayer was over, he said, ‘If only you could have seen me and 
          Iblees. I grabbed him and kept on trying to strangle him until I felt 
          the coldness of his saliva on these two fingers, the thumb and the one 
          next to it. Were it not for the prayer of my brother Sulaymaan, he would 
          have been tied to one of the pillars of the mosque this morning, and 
          the children of Madeenah would have played with him. Whoever among you 
          can prevent him from coming between him and the qiblah, let him do that.” 
          (Narrated by Ahmad, no. 11354). 
·It was narrated that Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with 
          him) said: I heard the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “The throne of Iblees 
          is on the sea and he sends out his troops to spread mischief (fitnah) 
          among the people. The greatest of them in his sight is the one who causes 
          the most fitnah.” (Narrated by Muslim, 5031; Ahmad, no. 1427) 
 So Iblees (may the curse of Allaah be upon 
          him) is still alive, and he will die on the Day 
          of the time appointed, until which Allaah has given him a respite, which 
          according to the most correct scholarly view is the Day of the first 
          blast on the Trumpet. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
10035,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10035,He is married to two wives and he does not work; should he divorce one of them?,My husband has two wives and no job should he divorce the first wife or the second?,,,"Praise be to Allah.A man’s provision is written for him, and the provision 
          of his family is written and decreed. Allaah says (interpretation of 
          the meaning): 
“And 
          no moving (living) creature is there on earth but its provision is due 
          from Allaah. And He knows its dwelling place and its deposit (in the 
          uterus or grave). All is in a Clear Book (Al-Laah Al-Mahfooz 
          — the Book of Decrees with Allaah).
[Hood 11:6] 
 Divorcing a wife will not increase one’s provision 
          or make things easier. Marriage and maintaining family stability is 
          what brings blessings and provision. Hence Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning): 
“And 
          marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who has no wife and 
          the woman who has no husband) and (also marry) the Saalihoon (pious, 
          fit and capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid-servants 
          (female slaves). If they be poor, Allaah will enrich them out of His 
          Bounty. And Allaah is All-Sufficient for His creatures’ needs, 
          All-Knowing (about the state of the people)”
[al-Noor 24:32] 
          
This aayah indicates that marriage is a means of getting 
          provision. 
 Moreover, Allaah commands men to spend on their 
          families, and commands those whose provision is restricted to spend 
          from what Allaah has given them, as much as they are able. He did not 
          command them to get divorced; on the contrary He said that after hardship 
          would come ease, and after hard times would come times of plenty. Allaah 
          says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Let 
          the rich man spend according to his means; and the man whose resources 
          are restricted, let him spend according to what Allaah has given him. 
          Allaah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him. Allaah 
          will grant after hardship, ease”
[al-Talaaq 65:7] 
          
 Our advice is that the husband should not divorce 
          any of his wives, and that he should put his trust in Allaah, be patient, 
          and strive to earn provision. He should not be lazy or complacent. He 
          has to put his trust in Allaah in the true sense. The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If you put your trust 
          in Allaah in the true sense, He will grant your provision as He grants 
          to the birds, who go out in the morning hungry and come back full.” 
          (Narrated by Ahmad, Ibn Maajah and al-Tirmidhi).
Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
          “What is meant by putting one’s trust in Allaah (tawakkul) is believing 
          in what is implied by this aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And 
          no moving (living) creature is there on earth but its provision is due 
          from Allaah” 
[Hood 11:6] 
It does not mean giving up striving 
          and relying on what one may get from one’s fellow-creatures, because 
          doing that may lead to the opposite of what comes from tawakkul. Ahmad 
          was asked about a man who sat in his house or in the mosque and said, 
          “I will not do anything until my rizq comes to me.” He said, “This is 
          a man who has no knowledge. The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Allaah has placed 
          my provision under the shadow of my spear,’ and he said: ‘If you to 
          put your trust in Allaah in the true sense, He will grant your provision 
          as He grants to the birds, who go out in the morning hungry and come 
          back full.’” He mentioned that they go out and about seeking their provision. 
          He said: “and the Sahaabah used to go out and engage in trade and tend 
          to their date-palm trees, and they are the example to be followed.”
Wives should help their husbands. They should pay attention 
          to his situation and abilities, and they should not expect more of him 
          than he is able to give. If (these two wives) are able to work in suitable 
          jobs and help their husband in spending, without transgressing the limits 
          set by sharee’ah and without neglecting the needs of the house and children, 
          then they will have the reward for that. It was stated in the hadeeth 
          that a woman came to the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of 
          Allaah, I am a woman who has a skilled craft, and I sell things from 
          that. I, my son and my husband have no other source of income, and they 
          have kept me from giving in charity. I cannot give anything in charity; 
          will I have any reward from what I spend (on them)? The Messenger of 
          Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
          Allaah be upon him) said to her, “Spend on them and you will a reward 
          so long as you spend on them.”  (Narrated by Ahmad, no. 15504). 
          According to a report narrated by al-Bukhaari, the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “She will have two 
          rewards: the reward for (upholding) family ties and the reward for giving 
          in charity.”

If this building which was sold after one

    year has passed between the time when its owner decided to sell it and the sale took place. But if he did not buy it in order to sell it (for a 
    profit), rather he no longer had any need of the house or property, and he wanted to sell it, but it took so long because he could not find anyone 
    to buy it, then there is no zakaah due on its price, but whatever he keeps of its price after paying off his debts, once one full hijri year has 
    passed he should pay zakaah on it, but if he spends it before the year has passed then there is no zakaah due. 
In conclusion: If this property is bought for 
    trade, then he has to pay zakaah on it when one full hijri year has passed from the time when he decided to sell it, even if it has not yet been 
    one year since he sold it. If he did not intend to trade it, rather he no longer had any need of it but he could not find a purchaser until after 
    a year had passed, then he does not have to pay zakaah on its price, rather he has to pay zakaah on the money he receives, when a full year has

Reference to lesbianism and homosexuality in the Sunnah","Praise be to Allah.There is wisdom in what Allah has commanded and what He has forbidden 
The Muslim should not doubt, even for an instant, that what Allah has prescribed is wise. He should know that there is great wisdom in what Allah has commanded and what He has forbidden. 
It is the straight path and is the only way in which man can be safe and at peace, protecting his honour, his mind and his health, in accordance with the natural disposition (fitrah) with which Allah has created man. 
Some heretics have tried to attack Islam and its rulings; they have denounced divorce and plural marriage and permitted alcohol. Those who look at the state of their societies will see the state of misery which those societies have reached. 
When they rejected divorce, murder took its place. When they rejected plural marriage, men started to take mistresses instead. When they allowed alcohol, all kinds of shameful and immoral actions became widespread. 
Gays and lesbians go against the natural disposition
 
They (gays and lesbians) both go against the natural disposition (fitrah) which Allah has created in mankind – and also in animals – whereby the male is inclined towards the female, and vice versa.
 
Whoever goes against that goes against the natural disposition of mankind, the fitrah. 
Dangers of homosexuality and lesbianism 
The spread of homosexuality has caused man diseases which neither the east nor the west can deny exist because of them. Even if the only result of this perversion was AIDS – which attacks the immune system in humans – that would be enough. 
It also causes the breakup of the family and leads people to give up their work and study because they are preoccupied with these perversions. 
Since the prohibition has come from his Lord, the Muslim should not wait until medicine proves that harm befalls the one who does that which Allah has forbidden. Rather he must believe firmly that Allah only prescribes that which is good for people, and these modern discoveries should only increase his certainty and confidence in the greatness of Allah’s wisdom. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
“Both of them – fornication and homosexuality – involve immorality that goes against the wisdom of Allah’s creation and commandment. For homosexuality involves innumerable evil and harms, and the one to whom it is done would be better off being killed than having this done to him, because after that he will become so evil and so corrupt that there can be no hope of his being reformed, and all good is lost for him, and he will no longer feel any shame before Allah or before His creation. The semen of the one who did that to him will act as a poison on his body and soul. The scholars differed as to whether the one to whom it is done will ever enter Paradise. There are two opinions which I heard Shaykh al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) narrate.” (al-Jawab al-Kafi, p. 115) 
What is lesbianism?
Lesbianism means one woman doing to another something like that which a man does to a woman. 
What is homosexuality?
Homosexuality means having intercourse with males in the back passage. This was the action of the accursed people of the Prophet of Allah Lut (peace be upon him). In shari’ah terminology it refers to inserting the tip of the penis into the anus of a male. 
Reference to lesbianism and homosexuality in the Quran
What is mentioned concerning these actions in the Quran and Sunnah: 
1- Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) Lut (Lot), when he said to his people: ‘Do you commit the worst sin such as none preceding you has committed in the ‘Alamin (mankind and jinn)?
Verily, you practice your lusts on men instead of women. Nay, but you are a people transgressing beyond bounds (by committing great sins)’” [al-A'raf 7:80-81]
2- “Verily, We sent against them a violent storm of stones (which destroyed them all), except the family of Lut (Lot), them We saved in the last hour of the night.” [al-Qamar 54:34 – interpretation of the meaning]
3- “And (remember) Lut (Lot), when he said to his people: ‘Do you commit the worst sin such as none preceding you has committed in the ‘Alamin (mankind and jinn)?” [al-A’raf 7:80 – interpretation of the meaning] 
And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) Lut (Lot), when he said to his people: ‘You commit Al-Fahishah (sodomy the worst sin) which none has preceded you in (committing) it in the ‘Alamin (mankind and jinn)’” [al-‘Ankabut 29:28] 
4- “And (remember) Lut (Lot), We gave him Hukm (right judgement of the affairs and Prophethood) and (religious) knowledge, and We saved him from the town (folk) who practiced Al-Khabaith (evil, wicked and filthy deeds). Verily, they were a people given to evil, and were Fasiqun (rebellious, disobedient to Allah)” [al-Anbiya  21:74 – interpretation of the meaning] 
5- “And (remember) Lut (Lot)! When he said to his people, ‘Do you commit Al-Fahishah (evil, great sin, every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse, sodomy) while you see (one another doing evil without any screen). Do you practice your lusts on men instead of women? Nay, but you are a people who behave senselessly.’ There was no other answer given by his people except that they said: ‘Drive out the family of Lut (Lot) from your city. Truly, these are men who want to be clean and pure!’ So We saved him and his family, except his wife. We destined her to be of those who remained behind. And We rained down on them a rain (of stones). So evil was the rain of those who were warned.” [al-Naml 27:54-58 – interpretation of the meaning] 
The punishment that befell the people of Lut 
These verses refer to the punishment that befell the people of Lut . With regard to the rulings on them: 
1- Allah says (interpretation of the meaning]: 
“And the two persons (man and woman) among you who commit illegal sexual intercourse, hurt them both. And if they repent (promise Allah that they will never repeat, i.e. commit illegal sexual intercourse and other similar sins) and do righteous good deeds, leave them alone. Surely, Allah is Ever All-Forgiving (the One Who forgives and accepts repentance ), (and He is) Most Merciful.” [al-Nisa 4:16] 
Ibn Kathir said: 
“The words of Allah ‘And the two persons (man and woman) among you who commit illegal sexual intercourse, hurt them both’ mean, those who commit immoral actions, punish them both. Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), Sa’id ibn Jubayr and others said: By condemning them, shaming them and hitting them with shoes. This was the ruling until Allah abrogated it and replaced it with whipping and stoning. ‘Ikrimah, ‘Ata, al-Hasan and ‘Abd-Allah ibn Kathir said: This was revealed concerning a man and woman who committed fornication. Al-Saddi said, it was revealed concerning young people before they get married. Mujahid said:  it was revealed concerning two men if they admit it bluntly; a hint is not sufficient  – as if he was referring to homosexuality. And Allah knows best.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 1/463).

Allah has prepared for His believing slaves in Paradise that which no eye has seen, no ear has heard and has never even crossed the minds of men, such that even the person who has the least blessings in Paradise will think that he is the most blessed among them. 
Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The lowest of people in status in Paradise will be a man whose face Allah turns away from the Fire towards Paradise, and shows him a tree giving shade. He will say, `O Lord, bring me closer to that tree so that I may be in its shade… Then he will enter his house [in Paradise] and his two wives from among Al-Hur Al-`Iyn will come in and will say to him, `Praise be to Allah who brought you to life for us and brought us to life for you.’ Then he will say, `No one has been given what I have been given.’” (Narrated by Muslim, 275)
 Among the blessings that Allah has prepared for His slaves are Al-Hur Al-`Iyn . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“So (it will be). And We shall marry them to Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes.” [Ad-Dukhan 44:54]
“They will recline (with ease) on thrones arranged in ranks. And We shall marry them to Hoor (fair females) with wide lovely eyes.” [At-Tur 52:20]
 Al-Hur Al-`Iyn are extremely beautiful, such that the marrow of their shins will be visible from beneath their garments. Every man who enters Paradise will have two wives from among Al-hoor Al-`iyn. Allah says, describing them (interpretation of the meaning):
“Therein (Gardens) will be Khayratun-Hisan [fair (wives) good and beautiful];
Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both (jinn and men) deny?
Hur (beautiful, fair females) guarded in pavilions;
Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both (jinn and men) deny?
With whom no man or jinni has had Tamth [opening their hymens with sexual intercourse] before them.
Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both (jinn and men) deny?
Reclining on green cushions and rich beautiful mattresses.” [Ar-Rahman 55:70-76]
 “And (there will be) Hur (fair females) with wide lovely eyes (as wives for Al-Muttaqun – the pious). Like unto preserved pearls.” [Al-Waqi`ah 56:22-23]
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The first group will enter Paradise looking like the moon on the night when it is full, and those who follow them will be like the brightest shining star in the sky. Their hearts will be as one, and there will be no hatred or jealousy among them. Each man will have two wives from among Al-Hur Al-`Iyn , the marrow of whose calves can be seen from beneath the bone and flesh.” (Narratedby Al-Bukhari, no. 3014)
 It was narrated that Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: `Going out and coming back for the sake of Allah is better than this world and all that is in it. And a spot the size of the bow of one of you in Paradise – or a spot the size of his whip – is better than this world and all that is in it. If a woman from among the people of Paradise were to look at the people of this earth, she would light up all that is in between them and fill it with fragrance. The veil on her head is better than this world and all that is in it.’” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2587)
Can you have sex in Jannah?
A man will have intercourse in Paradise with his wives from among Al-Hur Al-`Iyn and his wives from among the people of this world, if they enter Paradise with him. A man will be given the strength of a hundred men to eat, drink, feel desire and have sexual intercourse. 
It was narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The believer in Paradise will be given such and such strength for sexual intercourse.” He was asked, “O Messenger of Allah, will he really be able to do that?” He said, “He will be given the strength of one hundred (men).” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2459. He said, it is authentic)
 It was narrated from Zayd ibn Arqam (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A man among the people of Paradise will be given the strength of a hundred men for eating, drinking, desire and sexual intercourse. A man among the Jews said, `The one who eats or drinks needs to excrete!’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: `The excretion of any one of them will be in the form of sweat which comes out through his skin, then his stomach will reduce in size again.’” (Narrated by Ahmad, 18509 and Ad-Darimi, 2704)
 The Quran commentators said concerning the phrase “busy in joyful things” (Ya-Sin 36:55 – interpretation of the meaning):
 `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud and Ibn `Abbas (mayAllah be pleased with them both), and Sa`id ibn Al-Musayyib, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Al-A`mash, Sulayman At-Taymi and Al-Awza`i said concerning the verse (interpretation of the meaning),
“Verily, the dwellers of Paradise, that Day, will be busy in joyful things” [Ya-Sin 36:55]
they said, (it means) they will be busy deflowering virgins. Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said, according to a report narrated from him, that “busy in joyful things” means listening to stringed instruments. Abu Hatim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: he misheard the phrase Iftidad Al-Abkar (deflowering virgins) and thought it was Sama` Al-awtar (listening to stringed instruments). In fact the correct phrase is Iftidaad Al-Abkar (deflowering virgins). (Ibn Kathir, 3/564)
Can you have children in Jannah?
With regard to children, the scholars differed as to whether children would be born as a result of this intercourse or not . Some said that there would be children if the man wants them, but the pregnancy and birth would take just one hour.

Are Banu Hashim ibn ‘Abd Manaf among Ahl al-Bayt?


Are the freed slaves of the Prophet among Ahl al-Bayt?","Praise be to Allah.Who are Ahl al-Bayt?
There are several views among the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) concerning the definition of Ahl al-Bayt . Some said that the members of the Prophet’s family are his wives, his children, Banu Hashim, Banu al-Muttalib and their freed slaves. 
Some said that his wives were not part of the Ahl al-Bayt. Some said that the Ahl al-Bayt are Quraysh; some said that the family of Muhammad are the pious among his ummah; and some said that they are all of the ummah of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
Are the Prophet’s wives from Ahl Al-Bayt?
With regard to the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the most correct view is that they are included among the members of the family of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), because Allah says, after commanding the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to observe hijab (interpretation of the meaning):
“Allah wishes only to remove Ar-Rijs (evil deeds and sins) from you, O members of the family (of the Prophet), and to purify you with a thorough purification” [al-Ahzab 33:33]
  And the angels said to Sarah the wife of Ibrahim (peace be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning):
“The Mercy of Allah and His Blessings be on you, O the family [of Ibrahim (Abraham)]” [Hood 11:73]
And because Allah excluded the wife of Lut from the family of Lut (peace be upon him) with regard to survival, when He said (interpretation of the meaning):
“(All) except the family of Lut. Them all we are surely going to save (from destruction). Except his wife…” [al-Hijr  15:59-60]
This indicates that the wife is part of the family.
Is the family of ‘Abd al-Muttalib from Ahl al-Bayt?
With regard to the family of al-Muttalib, it was stated in a report from Imam Ahmad that they are among them [among the Ahl al-Bayt]. This is also the view of Imam al-Shafi'i. Imam Abu Hanifah and Imam Malik were of the view that the family of Muttalib are not included in the family of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him); there is also a report to this effect from Ahmad. 
The correct view is that Banu ‘Abd al-Muttalib are among the Ahl al-Bayt . The evidence for that is the report narrated from Jubayr ibn Mut’im (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “ ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan and I went to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, you have given to Banu’l-Muttalib and not to us, but we and they are the same in status with regard to you.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Banu’l-Muttalib and Banu Hashim are the same thing.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, no. 2907; al-Nasaa’i, 4067; and others)
Are Banu Hashim ibn ‘Abd Manaf among Ahl al-Bayt?
Included among the Ahl al-Bayt are Banu Hashim ibn ‘Abd Manaf, who are the family of ‘Ali, the family of ‘Abbas, the family of Ja’far, the family of ‘Aqil and the family of al-Harith ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib. 
This was stated in the report narrated by Imam Ahmad from Zayd ibn Arqam (may Allah be pleased with him), in which he said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood up and addressed us one day at a well called Khum, between Makkah and Madinah. He praised Allah and exhorted and reminded us. Then he said: ‘O people, I am a human being; soon the messenger of my Lord [i.e., the Angel of death] will come to me and I will answer his call. I am leaving among you two important things: the first of which is the Book of Allah, in which there is guidance and light, so adhere to it and follow it’ – and he urged us to adhere to the Book of Allah, then he said: ‘And the people of my household (ahl bayti). I remind you of Allah with regard to the people of my household, I remind you of Allah with regard to the people of my household, I remind you of Allah with regard to the people of my household.’” Husayn said to him [Zayd], “Who are the people of his household, O Zayd? Are not his wives among the people of his household?” Zayd said: “His wives are among the people of his household, but the people of his household are those who are forbidden to receive sadaqah (charity) after his death.” He (Husayn) said: “Who are they?” He said: “They are the family of ‘Ali, the family of ‘Aqil, the family of Ja’far and the family of ‘Abbas.” Husayn said: “Are all of these forbidden to receive sadaqah?” Zayd said, “Yes.” (Narrated by Ahmad, no. 18464)
Are the freed slaves of the Prophet among Ahl al-Bayt?
With regard to the freed slaves, it was narrated that Mihran the freed slave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said; “We are the family of Muhammad: the sadaqah is not permissible for us, and the freed slave of a people is one of them.” (Narrated by Ahmad, no. 15152)
So the family of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) are: his wives, his children, and Banu Hashim, Banu ‘Abd al-Muttalib and their freed slaves.

      obligatory is definitely a kaafir. The majority of the Salaf, of the
      Sahaabah and Taabi’een, were of the view that the person who does not
      pray is a kaafir, because of the saheeh texts which clearly state that.
      The dispute arose after their time, but the scholars who examined this
      issue said that the opinion stated is the more sound view, that the person

      preference to man-made laws and giving them precedence over the laws
      (sharee’ah) of Allaah, and believing that the laws of Allaah are not
      suitable for our times, for example, this is a form of major kufr which
      puts a person beyond the pale of Islam. The dispute among the scholars in
      this case has to do with the person who judges according to laws other
      than those revealed by Allaah, whilst still believing that the laws of
      Allaah are more perfect and more fitting – is he guilty of major kufr or
      a lesser form of kufr? Because Allaah has described those who rule
      according to laws other than His in different ways, sometimes as kaafirs,
      sometimes as faasiqoon (evildoers), sometimes as zaalimoon (wrongdoers).
      This is to be interpreted either as referring to different cases in which
      people rule according to laws other than those revealed by Allaah, or as
      meaning one and the same thing, because the kaafir is also a faasiq and a
      zaalim.",Shaykh ‘Abd al-Kareem al-Khudayr

Misconceptions about hijrah","Praise be to Allah.Why did the Prophet migrate to Madinah?
When the persecution of the people of Makkah against the Muslims grew intense, Allah commanded them to migrate so that they could establish the religion of Allah in a land where they could worship Him. 
Allah chose Madinah as the land of hijrah (migration for the sake of Allah). The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw in a dream that he was migrating to that city. 
Abu Musa narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I saw in a dream that I was migrating from Makkah to a land in which there are date-palms, and I thought that it was al-Yamamah or Hajar, but it turned out to be al-Madinah, Yathrib…” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3352; Muslim, 4217) 
Al-Bukhari (3906) narrated that ‘Aishah said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to the Muslims, “I have been shown the land to which you will migrate: it has palm trees between the two lava fields, the two stony tracts.” So, some people migrated to Madinah , and most of those people who had previously migrated to the land of Ethiopia, returned to Madinah.  
Al-Hafiz said: 
The harrah (stony tract) is land whose stones are black. This dream was different from the dream mentioned above in the hadith of Abu Musa in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was not sure where that land was. Ibn al-Tin said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was shown the land of migration in a way that could apply to Madinah and to other places, then he was shown the feature that is unique to Madinah so it became clear which land that was. 
Who were the first Companions who migrated to Madinah?
With regard to the first Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to migrate: 
Al-Bara (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The first ones who came to us of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) were Mus’ab ibn ‘Umayr and Ibn Umm Maktum. They started to teach us the Quran. Then ‘Ammar, Bilal, and Sa’d came, then ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab came with twenty others. Then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came, and I never saw the people of Madinah rejoice more than that. They rejoiced so much that I saw the girls and boys saying, “This is the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), he has come.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4560) 
Hijrah events
The following hadith sums up many of the events of the Prophet’s migration : 
 ‘Aishah said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to the Muslims:  
“In a dream I have been shown your place of migration, a land of date palm trees, between two lava fields, the two stony tracts.” So, some people migrated to Madinah, and most of those people who had previously migrated to the land of Ethiopia, returned to Madinah. Abu Bakr also prepared to leave for Madinah, but the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him, “Wait for a while, because I hope that I will be allowed to migrate also.” Abu Bakr said, “Do you indeed expect this? May my father be sacrificed for you!” The Prophet said, ""Yes."" So Abu Bakr stayed behind for the sake of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) so that he could accompany him. He fed two she-camels he owned with the leaves of the samur tree for four months. 
One day, while we were sitting in Abu Bakr's house at noon, someone said to Abu Bakr, ""This is the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with his head covered, coming at a time at which he never used to visit us before."" Abu Bakr said, ""May my father and mother be sacrificed for him. By Allah, he has not come at this hour except for something important."" So the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came and asked permission to enter, and he was admitted. When he entered, he said to Abu Bakr. ""Tell everyone who is present with you to go away."" Abu Bakr replied, ""There is no one here but your family. May my father be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah!"" The Prophet said, ""I have been given permission to migrate."" Abu Bakr said, ""Shall I accompany you? May my father be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah!"" The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ""Yes."" Abu Bakr said, ""O Messenger of Allah, may my father be sacrificed for you, take one of these two she-camels of mine."" The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) replied, ""(I will accept it) with payment."" So we prepared the baggage quickly and put some journey food in a leather bag for them. Asma, the daughter of Abu Bakr, cut a piece from her waist belt and tied the mouth of the leather bag with it, and for that reason she was named Dhat-un-Nitaqayn (i.e. the owner of two belts). 
Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Abu Bakr reached a cave on the mountain of Thawr and stayed there for three nights. 
'Abdullah bin Abi Bakr who was an intelligent and wise youth, stayed (with them) overnight. He would leave them before daybreak so that in the morning he would be with Quraysh, as if he had spent the night in Makkah. He would keep in mind any plot made against them, and when it became dark he would (go and) inform them of it. 'Amir bin Fuhayrah, the freed slave of Abu Bakr, used to bring the milch sheep (of his master, Abu Bakr) to them a little while after nightfall. So they always had fresh milk at night, the milk of their sheep. 'Amir bin Fuhayrah would then take the flock away when it was still dark (before daybreak). He did the same on each of those three nights. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Abu Bakr had hired a man from the tribe of Bani al-Dayl from the family of Bani ‘Abd ibn ‘Adiyy as an expert guide, … he was of the religion of the infidels of Quraysh but the Prophet and Abu Bakr trusted him and gave him their two she-camels and made an appointment with him for him to bring their two she-camels to the cave of the mountain of Thawr in the morning after three nights had passed. And (when they set out), 'Amir bin Fuhayrah and the guide went along with them and the guide led them along the coast. 
Ibn Shihab said: ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Malik al-Mudliji, who was the nephew of Suraqah ibn Malik ibn Ju'sham, told me that his father informed him that he heard Suraqah ibn Ju'sham saying, ""The messengers of the kuffar of Quraysh came to us declaring that they had assigned for the persons who would kill or arrest the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Abu Bakr, a reward equal to their blood money. While I was sitting in one of the gatherings of my tribe, Bani Mudlij, a man from them came to us and stood while we were sitting, and said, 'O Suraqah! No doubt, I have just seen some people far away on the shore, and I think they are Muhammad and his companions.' "" Suraqah added, ""I too realized that it must have been they. But I said 'No, it is not they, but you have seen so-and-so, and so-and-so whom we saw setting out.' I stayed in the gathering for a while and then got up and left for my home. I ordered my slave-girl to get my horse which was behind a hillock, and keep it ready for me. 
Then I took my spear and left by the back door of my house dragging the lower end of the spear on the ground and keeping it low. Then I reached my horse, mounted it and made it gallop. When I approached them (i.e. Muhammad and Abu Bakr), my horse stumbled and I fell down from it, Then I stood up, got hold of my quiver and took out the divining arrows and drew lots as to whether I should harm them (i.e. the Prophet and Abu Bakr) or not, and the lot which I disliked came out. But I remounted my horse and let it gallop, giving no importance to the divining arrows. When I heard the recitation of the Quran by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who was not looking around although Abu Bakr kept doing that, suddenly the forelegs of my horse sank into the ground up to the knees, and I fell down from it. Then I rebuked it and it got up but it could hardly lift its forelegs from the ground, and when it stood up straight again, its forelegs caused dust to rise up in the sky like smoke. Then again I drew lots with the divining arrows, and the lot which I disliked, came out. So I called to them to let them know they were safe. They stopped, and I remounted my horse and went to them. When I saw how I had been hampered from harming them, it came to my mind that the Cause of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) (i.e. Islam) would become victorious. So I said to him, ""Your people have assigned a reward equal to the blood money for your capture."" Then I told them all the plans the people of Makkah had made concerning them. Then I offered them some journey food and goods but they refused to take anything and did not ask for anything, but the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ""Do not tell others about us."" Then I requested him to write for me a guarantee of security. He ordered 'Amir bin Fuhayrah to write it for me on a piece of animal skin, then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went on his way."" 
Ibn Shihab said: 'Urwah ibn al-Zubayr told me: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) met al-Zubayr in a caravan of Muslim merchants who were returning from Syria. Al-Zubayr gave the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Abu Bakr a gift of white clothes. When the Muslims of Madinah heard the news of the departure of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) from Makkah (towards Madinah), they started going to the harrah (lava field) every morning. They would wait for him till the heat of the noon forced them to return. One day, after waiting for a long while, they returned home, and when they went into their houses, a Jew climbed up onto the roof of one of the forts of his people to look for something, and he saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions dressed in white clothes, as if they were emerging out of a desert mirage. 
The Jew could not help shouting at the top of his voice, ""O Arabs! Here is your great man whom you have been waiting for!"" So all the Muslims rushed to pick up their weapons and went to meet the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on the lava field. The Prophet turned with them to the right and alighted in the land of Bani 'Amr ibn 'Awf. This was on Monday in the month of Rabee’ al-Awwal. Abu Bakr stood up, receiving the people while the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sat down and kept silent. Some of the Ansar who came and had not seen the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) before, began greeting Abu Bakr, but when the sunshine fell on the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Abu Bakr came forward and shaded him with his cloak, only then did the people come to know the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).  
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stayed with Bani 'Amr ibn 'Awf for ten nights and established the mosque (mosque of Quba) which was founded on piety. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed in it and then mounted his she-camel and moved on, accompanied by the people till his she-camel knelt down at (the place of) the mosque of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) at Madinah. Some Muslims used to pray there in those days, and that place was a yard for drying dates belonging to Suhayl and Sahl, two orphan boys who were under the guardianship of As’ad ibn Zurarah. When his she-camel knelt down, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ""This place, Allah willing, will be our place."" The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) then called the two boys and told them to name a price for that yard so that he might take it as a mosque. The two boys said, ""No, but we will give it as a gift, O Messenger of Allah!"" The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) refused to take it as a gift and insisted on buying it from them, then he built a mosque there. The Prophet himself started carrying unburnt bricks for its building and while doing so, he was saying ""This load is better than the load of Khaybar, for it is more pious in the Sight of Allah and purer and better rewardable.""
He was also saying, ""O Allah! The actual reward is the reward in the Hereafter, so bestow Your Mercy on the Ansar and the Muhajirin.""
Thus the Prophet recited (by way of proverb) the poem of some Muslim poet whose name is unknown to me. 
Ibn Shibab said, ""We have not heard in any ahadith that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited any complete line of poetry apart from this.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3906)
Misconceptions about hijrah
But there is a specious argument put forward by some of those who want to stir up doubts about Islam. They say that the sirah narrated that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Abu Bakr migrated with two she-camels, and they entered the cave, and Quraysh pursued them; if they had two she-camels with them, the people of Quraysh would have known that Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his Companion had entered the cave. So where were the two camels? 
These doubters want to attack Islam so that people will not believe the sirah of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and to make them think that the sirah is based on illusions and lies.  
The response to this specious argument is very simple indeed. The report quoted above – of which these people are unaware, or they ignore it – tells them that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had hired a guide to show them the way, and even though he was a follower of the kafir religion of Quraysh, they trusted him. So they gave their mounts to him and made an appointment with him for him to bring their mounts back to them at the cave of Thawr after three nights had passed. 
This hadith clearly refutes their specious argument and shuts them up. Praise be to Allah for guidance after misguidance. 
Another thing that happened to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Abu Bakr on their way to Madinah: 
Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – when I was in the cave – “If any one of them looks down at his feet he will see us.” He said, “What do you think, O Abu Bakr, of two people of whom Allah is the third?” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3380; Muslim, 4389)

10065,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10065,Who are the ones who will be excused for ignorance about ‘aqeedah and matters of fiqh?,"Who are the ones who will be excused for ignorance? Will a person be excused for ignorance about matters of fiqh, or about matters of ‘aqeedah and Tawheed? What is the duty of the scholars with regard to this matter?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Claiming that one is ignorant or using this as an excuse is a matter which needs further discussion. Not everyone can be excused for his ignorance. With regard to the things which were brought by Islam, which the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained and which were made clear in the Book of Allaah and are widely known among the Muslims, no claim of ignorance will be accepted in these cases, especially in matters with have to do with ‘aqeedah and the basics of religion.  Allaah sent His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to teach the people their religion and explain it to them, and he conveyed the message clearly and explained to the ummah the truths of their religion. He explained everything and left them with a clear path which is always obvious. In the Book of Allaah there is guidance and light. If some people claim to be ignorant about things which are known to be essential parts of the religion and which are well known among the Muslims, such as claiming to be ignorant about shirk and worshipping anything other than Allaah, or claiming that salaah is not obligatory, or that fasting Ramadaan is not obligatory, or that paying zakaah is not obligatory, or that doing Hajj when one is able to is not obligatory – in these and similar matters, claims of ignorance are unacceptable from those who live among the Muslims, because they are matters which are well known among the Muslims. They are known to be essential parts of the Muslim religion and are widely known among the Muslims, so the claim of ignorance of these matters is unacceptable. This is the case if a person were to claim that he does not know that what the mushrikeen do at the graves or idols is wrong, when they call upon the dead, seek their help, offer sacrifices to them and make vows to them, or offer sacrifices to the idols, stars, trees or rocks; or seek healing or help against their enemies from the dead or idols or jinn or angels or Prophets… All of these are things which are known essentially in the religion that they are major shirk (al-shirk al-akbar). Allaah explained this clearly in His Book, and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained it clearly. He remained in Makkah for thirteen years warning the people against this shirk, and he preached the same message in Madeenah for ten years, explaining to them that it is obligatory for their worship to be purely and sincerely for Allaah Alone, and reciting to them the Book of Allaah, such as the verses (interpretation of the meaning):
 “And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him”
[al-Israa’ 17:23]
 “You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything). [al-Faatihah 1:5]
 “And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allaah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him) [al-Bayyinah 98:5]
 “So worship Allaah (Alone) by doing religious deeds sincerely for Allaah’s sake only.
Surely, the religion (i.e. the worship and the obedience) is for Allaah only [al-Zumar 39:2-3]
 “Say (O Muhammad): ‘Verily, my Salaah (prayer), my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allaah, the Lord of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists).
He has no partner. And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims.’” [al-An’aam 6:162-163]
 And Allaah says, addressing His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning):
 “Verily, We have granted you (O Muhammad) Al-Kawthar (a river in Paradise).
Therefore turn in prayer to your Lord and sacrifice (to Him only).” [al-Kawthar 108:1-2]
 “And the mosques are for Allaah (Alone), so invoke not anyone along with Allaah” [al-Jinn 72:18]
 “And whoever invokes (or worships), besides Allaah, any other ilaah (god), of whom he has no proof; then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely, Al-Kaafiroon (the disbelievers in Allaah and in the Oneness of Allaah, polytheists, pagans, idolaters) will not be successful” [al-Mu’minoon 23:117]
 The same applies in the case of those who make fun of the religion, attack it, mock it and insult it – all of these are forms of major kufr and are things for which none may be excused on the grounds of ignorance, because it is well known in the religion that insulting the religion or insulting the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) are forms of major kufr, as is making fun of the religion or mocking it. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say: ‘Was it at Allaah, and His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger that you were mocking?’
Make no excuse; you disbelieved after you had believed” [al-Tawbah 9:65-66]
It is obligatory for the scholars in every place to spread this knowledge among the people and to make it known so that the common folk will have no excuse and so that this important knowledge will become widespread among them; and so that they will give up their attachment to the dead and seeking help from them whether that is in Egypt, Syria, Iraq or in Madeenah at the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or in Makkah or anywhere else; and so that the pilgrims and the people will be aware, and will know the laws and religion of Allaah. The silence of the scholars is one of the reasons for the loss and ignorance of the common folk. The scholars, wherever they are, must convey to the people the religion of Allaah and teach them about the unity of Allaah (Tawheed) and the kinds of shirk, so that they will give up shirk out of understanding and so that they will worship Allaah Alone with understanding. Similarly, they must speak out against the things that happen at the grave of al-Badawi, the grave of al-Husayn (may Allaah be pleased with him), or at the grave of Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qaadir al-Jeelani or at the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in Madeenah and at other graves. The people must know that worship is due to Allaah alone, and no one else has any right to it, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allaah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him) [al-Bayyinah 98:5]
 “So worship Allaah (Alone) by doing religious deeds sincerely for Allaah’s sake only.
Surely, the religion (i.e. the worship and the obedience) is for Allaah only [al-Zumar 39:2-3]
“And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him” [al-Israa’ 17:23]
i.e., your Lord has commanded. So the duty of the scholars throughout the Muslim world and in the areas where there are Muslim minorities and in every place is to teach the people about the unity of Allaah (Tawheed) and to educate them about the meaning of worshipping Allaah, and to warn them against associating anything with Allaah (shirk), which is the greatest of sins. Allaah has created the two races (of mankind and the jinn) to worship Him, and He has commanded them to do that, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“And I (Allaah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone)” [al-Dhaariyaat 51:56]
 Worship means obeying Him and obeying His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), devoting worship sincerely and purely to Him, and focusing one’s heart on Him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
 “O mankind! Worship your Lord (Allaah), Who created you and those who were before you so that you may become Al-Muttaqûn (the pious)” [al-Baqarah 2:21]
 With regard to matters which may be unclear, such as some transactions and some matters of prayer and fasting, the one who is ignorant of them may be excused, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) excused the man who entered ihraam dressed in a cloak and wearing perfume. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him, “Take off the cloak and wash off the perfume, and do in your ‘umrah what you do in your Hajj.” He did not tell him to pay a penalty (fidyah) for his ignorance. By the same token, some matters which may be unclear should be taught to the one who is ignorant so that he will come to understand them. But as far as the basics of ‘aqeedah, the pillars of Islam, and things which are clearly haraam are concerned, claims of ignorance cannot be accepted from anyone who lives among the Muslims. If anyone who lives among the Muslims were to say, “I did not know that zinaa is haraam”, this is no excuse. If he were to say, “I did not know that disobeying my parents is haraam,” this is no excuse; rather he should be beaten and disciplined. Or if he were to say, “I did not know that homosexuality is haraam,” this is no excuse. These are matters which are clear and are well known among the Muslims and in Islam.
 But if he lived in a land far away from the Muslim world or in a remote part of Africa where there are no Muslims around him, then the claim of ignorance may be accepted from him, and if he dies in that state his case will rest with Allaah; he will come under the same ruling as those who lived during the fatrah (time between two Prophets). The correct view is that they will be tested on the Day of Resurrection: if they respond and obey they will enter Paradise, and if they disobey they will enter Hell. But the one who lived among the Muslims but did actions of kufr and neglected the well known obligations, has no excuse, because the matter is clear and there are Muslims around him, who fast and perform Hajj. All of this is well known and widespread among the Muslims, so the claim of ignorance in this case is a false claim. And Allaah is the One Whose help we seek.","Kitaab Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutnawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 7, p. 132"

‘Eid (festival) is the name given to something which returns ya’ood , and is used to describe  gatherings which happen repeatedly, on a yearly, monthly or weekly basis, etc. So an ‘eid includes a number of things, such as a day which comes regularly, e.g., ‘Eid al-Fitr and Friday; gatherings on that day; and actions such as acts of worship and customs which are done on that day.
Secondly:
any of these things which are intended as rituals or acts of worship aimed at drawing closer to Allah or glorifying Him in order to earn reward, or which involve imitating the people of Jaahiliyyah or any other groups of kaafirs, is a prohibited bid’ah, an innovation which comes under the general meaning of the hadeeth: “Whoever innovates something in this matter of ours (Islam) that is not part of it, will
have it rejected.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim).
Examples of that include Mawlid al-Nabi (the Prophet’s birthday), Mother’s Day and national holidays, because in the first case there are innovated acts of worship which Allah has not prescribed, and because it involves imitation of the Christians and other kaafirs. And in the second and third cases there is imitation of the kuffaar. But in cases where the intention is to organize work to serve the interests of the ummah and to put its affairs straight, or to organize programs of study, or to bring employees together for work purposes etc., which in and of themselves do not involve acts of worship and glorification, then these are a kind of benign innovation which do not come under the meaning of the hadeeth, “Whoever innovates something in this matter of ours (Islam) that is not a part of it will have it rejected.” So there is nothing wrong with such things, indeed they are allowed by sharee’ah.

Some say that adhan is fard kifayah (a communal obligation); this is the view of Imam Ahmad and was the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah; among contemporary scholars it is the view of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him). 
And some said that adhan is a Sunnah mu’akkadah. 
The correct view is that adhan is fard kifayah; if someone who is competent does it, the rest are absolved of sin.
Hadith about adhan
The evidence for that comes from the Sunnah.  
Malik ibn al-Huwayrith said: we came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when we were young men close in age, and we stayed with him for twenty days. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was merciful and kind; he thought that we were missing our families so he asked us about our families whom we had left behind, then he said, “Go back to your families, and stay with them; teach them and instruct them. When the time for prayer comes, let one of you give the call to prayer and let the oldest of you lead you in prayer.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 602; Muslim, 674). 
According to a report narrated by al-Bukhari, 604: “When you both go out, give the call to prayer (adhan), then the call immediately before the prayer (iqamah), then let the older of you lead you in prayer.” 
According to a report narrated by al-Tirmidhi (205) and al-Nasai (634): It was narrated that Malik ibn al-Huwayrith said: I came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with a cousin of mine, and he said, “When you travel, give the call to prayer (adhan), then the call immediately before the prayer (iqamah), then let the older of you lead you in prayer.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Irwa al-Ghalil, 1/230). 
This hadith indicates that the adhan is a communal obligation, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined that only one person should give the call to prayer for a group; he did not tell the whole group to give the call to prayer. See Tawdih al-Ahkam, 1/424. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
“This indicates that giving the call to prayer and praying in congregation are prescribed for travelers. It also shows that it is always encouraged to give the call to prayer, whether one is travelling or not.” (Sharh Muslim, 5/175)
Is prayer valid without adhan and iqamah?
The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 
“The adhan is fard kifayah (a communal obligation) in a town, and the same applies to the iqamah. If a person starts to pray without the adhan or iqamah , whether out of forgetfulness or ignorance, or for some other reason, the prayer is still valid.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 6/54) 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: 
“The evidence for them – i.e., the adhan and iqamah – being obligatory is the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in a number of ahadith, and the fact that he always did that whether he was travelling or not, and because the time of prayer cannot usually be known without it, and because it serves a purpose and because it is one of the manifest symbols of Islam.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 2/38)
Based on the fact that the adhan is fard kifayah, if the adhan is given in a town and the people can hear it, then the communal obligation has been discharged and there is no need to give the adhan for every congregation. But it is better and preferable to give the adhan even if a person is praying alone. 
Is it obligatory to give the adhan in every mosque?
The Standing Committee was asked: 
Is it obligatory to give the adhan over loudspeakers in every mosque in every neighbourhood, knowing that the adhan from one mosque can be heard by all the Muslims? Or is the adhan from one mosque sufficient for all the mosques of the neighbourhood? 
The answer was: 
“The adhan is fard kifayah, so if a muadhdhin gives the adhan in one neighbourhood and all the residents can hear it, that is sufficient. But it is prescribed for the people of each mosque to give the adhan because of the general meaning of the evidence.” 
Based on this, it is preferable for you to give the adhan, although that is not obligatory for you.

But doing salaah and performing Tawaaf for them, and reading Qur’aan for them – it is better not to do these things, because there is no evidence for that.
Some scholars regard that as being permissible, by analogy with charity and du’aa’. But to be on the safe side you should not do it.

10081,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10081,"Changing an evil is something that does concern a Muslim, it is not one of the things that do not concern him","there is a hadith,whoever sees a wrong must stop it by hand,etc and another:leave alone what does not concern you.would you clarify what to stop and what to leave alone.if i c someone doing immoral things in Saudi Arabia,like dating,etc.do i go and tell them not to while i know they probably wont listen,or do i just report it to some authority?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
There is no contradiction between what is proven in sharee’ah, whether between one aayah and another, between one hadeeth and another, or between aayahs and ahaadeeth. All of it is Revelation (wahy) from Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Had it been from other than Allaah, they would surely, have found therein many a contradiction”
[al-Nisa’ 4:82]
If there appears to be a contradiction, that is in our own minds and because of our misunderstanding, not in the texts themselves. Hence the scholars took the care to explain the texts in which there may appear to be a contradiction and to dispel any confusion that may have arisen in some people’s minds concerning some texts. With regard to the question, there is no contradiction – praise be to Allaah – between the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand [by taking action]; if he cannot, then with his tongue [by speaking out]; and if he cannot, then with his heart [by hating it and feeling that it is wrong] – and that is the weakest of faith” (Narrated by Muslim, 49), and his words, “Part of a person’s being a good Muslim is his leaving alone that which does not concern him” (narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2317, classed as saheeh by Ibn al-Qayyim in al-Jawaab al-Kaafi, p. 112) 
It is not possible under any circumstances that Islam would oblige the person who sees an evil action to change it, then at the same time tell him that it is better not to denounce it. 
The circumstances in which the first hadeeth applies are different from those in which the second hadeeth applies.  
This is similar to what some people understood from the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Take care of your ownselves. If you follow the (right) guidance [and enjoin what is right (Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and forbid what is wrong (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden)] no hurt can come to you from those who are in error”
[al-Maa’idah 5:105]
But Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with him) guided them to the correct understanding, and the scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) explained that. 
It was narrated that Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “O people, you recite this verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘O you who believe! Take care of your ownselves. If you follow the (right) guidance [and enjoin what is right (Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and forbid what is wrong (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden)] no hurt can come to you from those who are in error’
[al-Maa’idah 5:105]
I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, ‘When the people see an oppressor but they do not try to stop him, soon Allaah will cause all of them to suffer punishment because of him.’”  
(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2168; Abu Dawood, 4338; Ibn Maajah, 4005). 
This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Hibbaan, 1/540. 
Shaykh al-Islam said concerning what we learn from the verse “Take care of your ownselves…”: 
“… Enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil in the manner prescribed in Islam, based on knowledge, kindness, patience, good intentions and doing it in the proper manner, is included in the phrase “Take care of your ownselves…” and in the phrase “If you follow the (right) guidance”. 
These five things are what may be learned from the aayah, for the one who is commanded to enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil. 
There is also another meaning which is that a person should focus on his own interests by seeking knowledge and acting upon it, and not worry about that which does not concern him, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Part of a person’s being a good Muslim is his leaving alone that which does not concern him.” Especially being too curious about that of which a person has no need to know about another person’s religious commitment or worldly affairs, and especially if he is speaking because of hasad (destructive envy) or competing in leadership.  
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 14/482 
And he (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
The believer has to fear Allaah with regard to His slaves and it is not his responsibility to guide them. This is the meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘O you who believe! Take care of your ownselves. If you follow the (right) guidance [and enjoin what is right (Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and forbid what is wrong (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden)] no hurt can come to you from those who are in error’
[al-Maa’idah 5:105]
Calling others to guidance means doing what is obligatory. If the Muslim does his duty of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and does his other duties as well, then the misguidance of those who have gone astray will not harm him. That may be achieved sometimes by the heart, sometimes by the tongue and sometimes by the hand. In the case of the heart, this is obligatory in all circumstances because doing it will not cause any harm. Whoever does not even do that is not a believer, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ‘And that is the weakest of faith.’”  
(Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 28/126-128) 
So it is known that denouncing evil is one of the things that concern the Muslim, and he must denounce it as much as he is able and in accordance with the interests of sharee’ah. That which does not concern him cannot be something that is waajib (obligatory) or mustahabb (encouraged).  
There follow the comments of the scholars on the interpretation of the hadeeth, “Part of a person’s being a good Muslim is his leaving alone that which does not concern him.” 
(a)Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:
The Muslim is commanded either to speak good or to keep silent. If he turns away from the silence that is enjoined upon him and speaks in a unnecessary manner that is not good, then this is counted against him. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Part of a person’s being a good Muslim is his leaving alone that which does not concern him.” If a person indulges in something that does not concern him, that detracts from his being a good Muslim. 
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 7/49, 50 
(b)Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) summed up all of piety in one sentence, when he said: “Part of a person’s being a good Muslim is his leaving alone that which does not concern him.” This includes not speaking about, looking at, listening to, striking a blow, walking towards or thinking about anything for no purpose, and keeping away from all outward and inward actions that have to do with things that do not concern you. This sentence is sufficient concerning piety. 
(c)Ibraaheem ibn Adham said:
Piety means leaving alone all doubtful things and leaving alone that which does not concern you means leaving alone all that is superfluous. 
In al-Tirmidhi there is a marfoo’ report according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O Abu Hurayrah, be pious and you will be the most devoted of people (to Allaah).”  
Madaarij al-Saalikeen, 2/21 
(d)Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali said:
This means giving up haraam things, doubtful things, makrooh things, and excessive permissible things that are unnecessary, because all of these things do not concern the Muslim if his Islam is perfect and he has attained the level of ihsaan. The most important aspect of leaving alone that which does not concern you is guarding your tongue against idle speech. 
Jaami’ al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hukam, 1/309-310 
(e)al-Zarqaani said:
Some of them said that what comes under the heading of leaving alone that which does not concern you is learning branches of knowledge that are not important and ignoring those that are more important, such as one who neglects to acquire knowledge that is in his own interests and occupies himself with learning something that does not benefit anyone else, such as philosophical debate, and says as an excuse, ‘My intention is to benefit people.’ If he were sincere he would have started by learning the type of knowledge that would help him to be guided and cleanse himself of all blameworthy characteristics such as destructive envy (hasad), showing off, arrogance, self-admiration, rivalry with one's peers, trying to put people down and other characteristics and actions that may doom a person to Hell. 
Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: this hadeeth is an example of concise speech which includes many noble meanings in a few words, and it is one of the things that were said by no one before him. 
Sharh al-Zarqaani, 4/317 
(f)al-Mubaarakfoori said:
Al-Qaari said – concerning the meaning of leaving alone that which does not concern him – this means that which is not his business and which it does not befit him to say, do, look at or think about. And he said: what is meant by that which does not concern him is that which he has no need of and is not essential to his spiritual or worldly affairs, and will not help him to earn the pleasure of his Lord, because he is able to live without it, and he can put his affairs straight without it. This includes all superfluous deeds and words. 
Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi, 6/500 
Secondly: 
With regard to what is to be denounced: this includes every reprehensible action which Islam stated is abhorrent and which leads to bad consequences for the one who does it, such as zina (adultery), riba (usury, interest), looking at haraam things, listening to haraam things, shaving the beard, allowing one's garment to hang below the ankles, severing the ties of kinship, introducing innovations into the religion, and so on. 
It is not necessary to be in a position of authority in order to change evil actions by one's hand, or to be a scholar in order to change them by one's tongue, rather it is sufficient to be able to change them provided that that does not result in a greater evil than the one that you are denouncing. It is sufficient for you to know that this is evil according to sharee’ah, so you denounce it by speaking out. 
With regard to changing evil actions by one's heart. This means hating this evil thing in your heart and leaving the place where it is happening. 
With regard to your question about seeing some evil things and wondering whether you should denounce the people who are doing them or inform the authorities, our answer is that it depends on the action in question and on who is doing it. If you see an evil action on the part of someone that you cannot leave him and go and tell the authorities about it, then you have to denounce him straightaway, because it may be too late otherwise. 
But if the evil action is major and serious, and you cannot denounce it on your own, then you have to inform the authorities. 
The point is that evil must be removed, whether by your hand or the hand of someone else. If that is not possible then it must be done by your tongue (by your speaking out), and you should not worry whether they listen to you or turn away from you; all you have to do is convey the message. Allaah may sow the seeds of guidance in the heart of one of them because of your words, but the Shaytaan may also suggest to you that you should forget about denouncing them on the basis that they will not listen to you – so beware of that.

10083,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10083,"Seeking blessing from scholars and righteous people, and their relics","There are people who think that it is permissible to seek blessing from the scholars and righteous people, and their relics, based on the reports of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) seeking blessing from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). What is the ruling on that? Does that not involve likening someone who is not the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? Is it possible to seek blessing from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) after his death? What is the ruling on seeking means of drawing closer to Allaah (tawassul) by seeking blessing from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to seek blessing from anyone other than the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), not from his wudoo’ or his hair or his sweat or anything else from his body. All of that applies only to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because of the goodness and blessing that Allaah has put in his body and whatever he touches.
 Hence the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) did not seek blessing from any one of their number during the lifetime of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or after his death, not with the Khulafaa’ al-Raashideen or anyone else. This indicates that they knew that this applied only to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and not to anyone else. And because this is a means that could lead to shirk and worshipping someone other than Allaah. Similarly it is not permissible to seek means of drawing closer to Allaah (tawassul) by virtue of the position and status of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or his person, or his attributes, or his blessing, because there is no evidence (daleel) for that, and because these are among the means that may lead to shirk and they are ways of exaggerating about him (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).  
Also, these things were not done by the Sahaabah, and if they were good then they would have done them before us. And this goes against the evidence of sharee’ah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allaah, so call on Him by them” [al-A’raaf 7:180] 
Allaah did not command us to call upon Him by virtue of the position or status or blessing of anyone. 
Part of that is seeking means of drawing closer to Him by virtue of His attributes, such as His Glory, His Mercy, His Words, etc. An example of that is to be found in the saheeh ahaadeeth which speak of seeking refuge in the perfect words of Allaah, and seeking refuge in the Glory and Power of Allaah. 
Also connected to that is the idea of seeking means of drawing closer to Allaah by loving Allaah and loving His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), by believing in Allaah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and seeking to draw nearer to Allaah by virtue of one’s righteous deeds, as described in the story of the people in the cave, whose need for shelter in the rain led them to enter a cave, then a rock fell down from the mountain and blocked the entrance of the cave. They were not able to push it away, so they discussed amongst themselves ways of getting out. 
They came to an agreement that the only way they would be saved from their predicament would be if they called upon Allaah by virtue of their righteous deeds. So one of them called upon Allaah by virtue of his honouring his parents, and the rock moved a little, but they could not get out… The second one called upon Allaah by virtue of his keeping away from zinaa on an occasion when he was able to indulge in it, and the rock moved a little but they still could not get out… Then the third one called upon Allaah by virtue of his fulfilling a trust, and the rock moved and they were able to escape.
 This hadeeth is reported in al-Saheehayn from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him); it is one of the stories of the people who came before us, in which there is a lesson and a reminder for us. 
The scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) stated the points mentioned in this answer, such as Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, his student Ibn al-Qayyim, Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Hasan in Fath al-Majeed Sharh Kitaab al-Tawheed, and others. With regard to the hadeeth about the blind man who sought to call upon Allaah (to cure him of his blindness) by virtue of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) during his life time, so the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) interceded for him and prayed for him, and Allaah restored his sight – this was a case of seeking the help of Allaah by means of the du’aa’ and intercession of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), not by means of his status and virtue. This is clear from the hadeeth… And similarly, the people will seek his intercession on the Day of Resurrection for Judgement to be passed, and the people of Paradise will seek his intercession on the Day of Resurrection for them to be admitted to Paradise. In all these cases, the help of Allaah is sought through him when he is alive, whether that is in this world or in the Hereafter, and it is seeking the help of Allaah through his du’aa’ and intercession, not by virtue of his person or status, as was clearly stated by the scholars, including those whom we have mentioned above.","Kitaab Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 7, p. 65"

      is not permissible, and in fact it is a form of major shirk (al-shirk
      al-akbar), because it involves calling upon someone other than Allaah and
      asking for something from one of the unseen creatures. This is like asking
      from the jinn or idols or the dead, because of the general meaning of the
      words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And
      the mosques are for Allaah (Alone), so invoke not anyone along with
      Allaah”[al-Jinn
      72:18]
“Such
      is Allaah, your Lord; His is the kingdom. And those, whom you invoke or
      call upon instead of Him, ownnot even a Qitmeer (the thin membrane over the date stone).
If
      you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your call; and if (in case)
      they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on
      the Day of Resurrection, they will
      disown your worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammad) like
      Him Who is the All Knower (of everything)”[Faatir
      35:13-14]
 Allaah
      described calling upon anyone other than Him, such as the dead, idols, the
      jinn or the angels, as shirk or the association of others in worship with
      Him. He said (interpretation of the meaning) 
“And
      verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the males among
      the jinn, but they (jinn) increased them (mankind) in sin and
      transgression”[al-Jinn 72:6] 
“And
      whoever invokes (or worships), besides Allaah, any other ilaah (god), of
      whom he has no proof; then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely, Al
      Kaafiroon
      (the disbelievers in Allaah and in the Oneness of Allaah, polytheists,
      pagans, idolaters) will not be successful”[al-Mu’minoon
      23:117] 
So Allaah calls
      those who call upon anyone other than Him kaafireen.This applies to all those who call upon anyone other than Allaah,
      whether it be the dead, idols, jinn or angels; no one is exluded from that
      except one who is alive, present and able to help, because Allaah says in
      the story of Moosa (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The man of
      his (own) party [religion] asked him for help against his foe”[al-Qasas
      28:15] 
Examples of this
      shirk are to be found in what some people say, such as “O jinn, seize
      him” or “O seven (jinn), seize him” or “O jinn of the noon-time,
      seize him” or “O jinn of such-and-such a valley” or “O jinn of
      such-and-such a land”. All of this is major shirk and is calling upon
      unseen creatures instead of Allaah. If a person says, “O angels of
      Allaah, wake me up” or “protect me”, this is also major shirk, and
      if he says, “O jinn protect me” or “wake me up”, this is also
      major shirk. We seek refuge with Allaah from that. The Muslim must beware
      of that and must seek help from Allaah alone and ask from Him alone, for
      He is Sufficient and He is Able to do all things. Allaah is the One Who
      says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And
      your Lord said: ‘Invoke Me [i.e. believe in My Oneness (Islamic
      Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your
      (invocation)’”[Ghaafir 40:60]
“And
      when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then (answer them), I
      am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of
      the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor).
      So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright[al-Baqarah
      2:186] 
And the Prophet
       (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If you ask of
      anyone, then ask of Allaah, and if you seek help, then seek help from
      Allaah.”

Ibn Katheer said:  
“he shall dwell therein forever” means, he will stay there and remain there, he will have no way out of it and that will never cease for him. Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 3/520 
6 – Allaah tells us that the kuffaar will not die in Hell and they will never have a good life. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

7 – It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Death will be brought forth in the form of a black and white speckled ram, and a caller will cry out, ‘O people of Paradise!’ They will crane their necks and look, and he will say, ‘Do you recognize this?’ They will say, ‘Yes, it is death,’ and all of them will have seen it. Then he will cry out, ‘O people of Hell!’ They will crane their necks and look, and he will say, ‘Do you recognize this?’ They will say, ‘Yes, it is death,’ and all of them will have seen it. Then the ram will be slaughtered, and he (the caller) will say, ‘O people of Paradise, it is eternal and there will be no death; O people of Hell, it is eternal and there will be no death.’” Then he recited (interpretation of the meaning): “And warn them (O Muhammad) of the Day of grief and regrets, when the case has been decided, while (now) they are in a state of carelessness, and they believe not” [Maryam 19:39] Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4453; Muslim, 2849 
According to the version narrated from Ibn ‘Umar in Muslim (2850): “And the joy of the people of Paradise will be increased, and the grief of the people of Hell will be increased.” 
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
This ram and the action of laying it down and slaughtering it whilst the two groups are looking on is something real; it is not something illusionary or symbolic, as some people made the serious mistake of suggesting. They said that it is a description, but a description cannot take a physical shape, let alone be slaughtered. 
That view is not correct, for Allaah will cause death to appear in the form of a ram which will be slaughtered, just as He will cause deeds to appear in visible forms by which people will be rewarded or punished. Allaah can cause descriptions to appear in physical forms the substance of which is the description, and He can create characteristics from physical beings, and He can create descriptions from descriptions and physical beings from physical beings. All four categories are possible for Allaah, and there is no contradiction in any of that. It is not something impossible, and there is no need for far-fetched interpretations such as saying that it refers to the slaughter of the Angel of Death. All of that is a misinterpretation of the words of Allaah and His Messenger and a false understanding that is not dictated by reason or the reports, which is caused by lack of understanding of what the Messenger said. 
Haadi al-Arwaah, p. 283, 284 
8 – It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The people of Paradise will enter Paradise and the people of Hell will enter Hell, then a caller will stand between them and will say, “O people of Hell, there is no death; O people of Paradise, there is no death. It is eternal.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6178; Muslim, 2850) 
9 – It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri and Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A caller will cry out (i.e., to the people of Paradise): ‘You will be healthy and will never fall sick; you will live and will never die; you will remain young and will never grow old; you will feel ease and will never be miserable.’ This is what Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And it will be cried out to them: “This is the Paradise which you have inherited for what you used to do”’ [al-A’raaf 7:43].  
Narrated by Muslim, 2827 
So hasten to do righteous deeds in this world, for it is only a short time before you will move to the realm of eternity, either to Paradise whose delights will never end or to Hell whose heat is eternal… so hasten and beware of procrastinating, for most of the pain of the people of Hell will be because of procrastination.

10089,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10089,Husband asking his wife how she disposed of the mahr,"Does the husband have the right to question his wife and ask her how she spent the mahr that belongs to her? My husband is asking about every part of my mahr, great and small, because he divided the mahr into two parts, one part for me and the other to prepare for marriage and buy clothes.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not 
    permissible for a husband to question his wife about the mahr which he gave 
    to her, because this is her right and a debt on him which he has to give to 
    her. 
In return 
    for this small amount of money which Allaah has granted to the woman, the 
    right of qiwaamah (being in charge, being the protector and maintainer) is 
    taken from her and given to her husband. So his spending on her is in return 
    for something very precious and the mahr and spending on her is in return 
    for that qiwaamah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Men are 
    the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one of them 
    to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their 
    means”
[al-Nisa’ 
    4:34]
Imam 
    al-Tabari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
“Men are the 
    ones who are in charge of their womenfolk, disciplining them and making them 
    fulfil their obligations towards Allaah and towards themselves. ‘Because 
    Allaah has made one of them to excel the other’ means, because Allaah 
    has given men an advantage over their wives because of the mahr which they 
    give to them, and because they spend on them from their own money, and they 
    take care of them. This is the way in which Allaah has caused them to excel 
    them. Hence they are in charge of them and women are expected to obey their 
    husbands. 
Tafseer 
    al-Tabari, 5/57 
So the mahr is the woman’s right, just 
    as qiwaamah is the man’s right. Just as she should not disobey him because 
    of that qiwaamah, so he should give her her rights. 
Men must 
    fear Allaah with regard to their wives’ mahr and give them their mahrs. For 
    women are weak, so men should give them their rights.

    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you 
    who believe! Fulfil (your) obligations”

    “The conditions which most deserve to be fulfilled are those by means of 
    which intimacy becomes permissible to you.”
(Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 2520; Muslim, 2542) 
So long as a 
    woman has taken possession of this money in this manner, her husband has no 
    right to force her to spend it in a particular way, unless she is spending 
    it on something haraam, in which case he has the right to stop her from 
    spending it in haraam ways. 
Our advice to you is to deal with your husband gently and calmly when he questions you about the mahr, lest a dispute concerning this matter be the cause of letting the Shaytaan come between you, especially when you are at the beginning of your married life, which should be based on harmony and tolerance on both sides towards any shortcomings or transgressions on the other side.  We ask Allaah 
    to decree for you a happy life filled with obedience to Allaah and following his laws. And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A

10091,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10091,How can he treat his two wives fairly?,Is it permissable for a man to be unfair to his wife if he has two wives or one of his wives by not splitting up up the time properly . he sometimes leaves the second wife house two or three hours late causing the first wife to be upset because of his lateness .,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Islam requires the man who has more than one wife to treat his wives equally and fairly. 
What is meant by that is fairness with regard to spending the night, accommodation, spending and clothing. 
What is meant by fairness in spending the night is that he should divide his time equally among his wives, so if he spends one or two nights with the first, he must spend the same amount of time with each of his wives. 
Al-Shaafa’i said: 
The Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and the view of most of the Muslim scholars indicate that the man must divide his time, night and day, among his wives, and must divide it equally, and that he is not allowed to be unfair in that.  
Al-Umm, 5/110 
What is meant by fairness in accommodation is that each of them should have her own accommodation where he comes to her, and their accommodation should not vary with the intention of favouring one over the other. 
Ibn Qudaamah said: 
The man does not have the right to make his two wives live together in one house without their consent, whether they are young or old, because that causes them harm due to the enmity and jealousy that exists between them, so making them live together provokes arguments and fighting, and each of them can hear sounds when he is intimate with the other, or she can see that. But if they agree to that then it is permissible, because they have that right but they are also allowed to forego it. 
Al-Mughni, 7/229. 
Al-Kaasaani said: 
If the husband wants her (his wife) to live with her co-wife or her in-laws, such as his mother, sister or daughter from another wife, or with his relatives, and she refuses, then he must accommodate her in a separate house, because they may annoy her or harm her if she lives with them. Her refusal is an indication of that annoyance and harm. Also he needs to be able to have intercourse with her and be intimate with her at any time that suits him, and that is not possible if a third person is present. 
Badaa’i al-Sanaa’i’, 4/23. 
What is meant by fairness in spending and clothing is that he should spend on them as much as he can afford. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
With regard to fairness in spending and clothing, this is also Sunnah, following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), He used to spend equally on his wives, and also used to divide his time equally among them. 
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 32/269. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
He (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to treat them equally as regards staying the night, spending time with them and spending on them.
Zaad al-Ma’aad, 1/151 
With regard to other things, it does not matter if he does not treat them equally, such as giving a gift to one of them, or being more inclined towards one of them in his heart, or giving her more clothing than he is obliged to, or having intercourse with one of them more than another, without intending to harm the other. But if he treats them all equally that is better. 
Ibn Qudaamah said: 
He does not have to treat his wives equally in spending and clothing if he does what he is required for each of them. 
Ahmad said – concerning a man who had two wives – he has the right to give one more than the other with regard to spending, desire and clothing, if the other has enough, and he may buy a finer garment for her, so long as the other has enough.  
This is because it is too difficult to treat them equally with regard to all these matters, and if it were made obligatory he would not be able to do it, except with great difficulty. This is why it is not obligatory, such as treating them equally with regard to intercourse. 
Al-Mughni, 7/232. 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said: 
If he gives each of them her rights with regard to clothing, spending and spending time with them, then it does not matter if his heart is inclined more towards one or if he gives one a gift… 
Fath al-Baari, 9/391. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
Our companions said: If he treats them equally (in the matters where that is required), he does not have to treat them equally with regard to intercourse, rather he should stay overnight with all of them but he does not have to have intercourse with each of them. He may have intercourse with some of them when it is their turn for him to stay with them and not others. But it is mustahabb for him not to neglect intimacy with some of them and to treat them all equally in this matter. 
Sharh Muslim, 10/46. 
Ibn Qudaamah said: 
We do not know of any dispute among the scholars regarding the fact that it is not obligatory to treat one's wives equally as regards intercourse, which is the view of Maalik and al-Shaafa’i, because intercourse has to do with desire and inclination, and there is no way to treat them equally in this regard. A man's heart may incline more to one of them than the other. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“You will never be able to do perfect justice between wives even if it is your ardent desire”
[al-Nisa’ 4:129]
‘Ubaydah al-Salmaani said concerning love and intercourse: 
If you are able to treat them equally with regard to intercourse, that is better, because it is more fair and just… But it is not obligatory to treat them equally with regard to intimacy that is less than intercourse, kissing, touching, etc, because if it is not essential to treat them equally with regard to intercourse, then that applies even more to the things that lead to it. 
Al-Mughni, 7/234, 235. 
Secondly: 
With regard to the husband going out when it is one wife’s turn, if that is because of some need and he does not intend to hurt her and he is not going out to the other wife, there is nothing wrong with that in sha Allaah. The basis of equal sharing of time is staying the night: he has to spend most of the night with the wife whose turn it is. Allaah has not created any hardship in religion, and it does not prevent the husband from going out or going shopping or attending classes during the time of one of his wives, if he does not intend to hurt her by going out, and he does not spend most of the night outside the house of the wife whose turn it is. 
Dr Ahmad Rayaan said: 
Some of the scholars have spoken in strict terms about fairness in dividing his time, and they say that everyone who goes against that is not treating his wives equally. Some of them even say that if he comes to the first wife after sunset and to the second after ‘Isha’, he is not treating them equally. 
What that means is that the husband must finish with all his business during the day, before the sun goes down, so that he can control the time when he goes to his wives each day, so that he goes at a specific hour each day. That may have been possible in the past when life was simpler and there were less necessities and people could live with less. But it is not possible now. How many men now can regulate their movements in such a way as to make sure they enter the house before the sun goes down each day, so that their division of time and their spending the night with each wife is completely equal? 
Rather it is more appropriate to suggest that he must spend most of the night in the house, without specifying the time when he should come in or go out, because his living circumstances or other people’s rights or the pursuit of knowledge and other circumstances may require him to go home late or leave home early. So what matters is that he should stay with the wife whose turn it is for most of the night, because the point of staying with his wife is to keep her company and be intimate with her, which can be achieved by the husband spending most of the night with her. We have seen from the ahaadeeth quoted above the way in which this division of time was achieved in the family of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him. The fact that he visited his other wives by night or by day, or met with them in the house of the wife whose turn it was did not contradict this fair division of time, even though it is well known that these visits and meetings might detract somewhat from the rights of the wife whose night it was, because it took some of her own time, and she had the exclusive right to this time where the others did not.  
Hence I think that what matters with regard to the issue of dividing the husband’s time among his wives is that he should spend most of the night with her whilst stipulating that his coming late should not be done with the intention of harming the wife whose night it is, rather it is the result of the husband’s everyday work.
