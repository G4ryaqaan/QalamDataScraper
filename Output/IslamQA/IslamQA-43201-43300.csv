43207,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43207,It is permissible for a wife to give the zakah of her wealth to her husband,"My wife has gold on which Zakat is due. She is a house wife and has no income of her own. so, I have to pay Zakat foe her. I am mtself under debt and have to return loans. can my wife give me money back which I give her to pay Zakat so that I can pay my loans off.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
It is not obligatory for a husband to pay zakah on behalf of his wife, because zakah is obligatory on the owner of the wealth. zakah is not part of the obligatory maintenance to which a wife is entitled from her husband. 
Secondly: 
With regard to a wife giving the zakah of her wealth to her husband, many scholars have said that this is permissible, and they quote as evidence the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (1462) and Muslim (1000) from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him), that when the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded the women to give in charity, Zaynab the wife of ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood came to him and said: “O Prophet of Allah, today you told us to give in charity. I have some jewellery and I want to give it in charity, but Ibn Mas’ood claims that he and his child are more deserving of my charity.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Ibn Mas’ood has spoken the truth. Your husband and child are more deserving of your charity.” 
Al-Haafiz said: 
This hadeeth indicates that it is permissible for a woman to give her zakah to her husband. This is the view of al-Shaafa’i, al-Thawri and the two companions of Abu Haneefah. It was one of the two reports narrated from Maalik, and from Ahmad. 
This is supported by the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not discuss it further with her, which may be interpretted as meaning that his statement is applicable in general terms, because when she mentioned charity, he did not ask whether this was voluntary charity or obligatory charity (i.e., zakah). It is as if he said: That is a valid action on your part whether it is obligatory or voluntary. 
Some scholars said that it is not allowed for a wife to give the zakah of her wealth to her husband, because he is going to spend some of it on her, so it is as if she is giving the zakah to herself. They interpreted this hadeeth as referring to voluntary charity. 
Ibn al-Munayyir responded to this view by saying: The possibility that her charity may come back to her also applies in the case of voluntary charity. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (6/168-169): 
The correct view is that it is permissible to give zakah to one’s husband if he is one of the people who are entitled to zakah. 
Perhaps evidence for that may be seen in the words that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) spoke to Zaynab the wife of ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with them both): “Ibn Mas’ood has spoken the truth. Your husband and child are more deserving of your charity.” We may say that this includes both obligatory and voluntary (naafil) charity. Whatever the case, if this hadeeth is evidence then all well and good, but if it applies only to voluntary charity then with regard to giving zakah to one’s husband we say: if the husband is poor then he is entitled to zakah, and where is the evidence that this is not allowed? Because if the ruling can only be proven by evidence, there is no evidence either from the Qur’aan or the Sunnah that a woman cannot give her zakah to her husband. 
The Standing Committee (10/62) was asked: 
Is it permissible for a woman to give the zakah of her wealth to her husband if he is poor? 
They replied: it is permissible for a woman to give the zakah of her wealth to her husband if he is poor so as to ward off his poverty, because of the general meaning of the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“As-Sadaqaat (here it means zakah) are only for the Fuqaraa’ (poor), and Al-Masaakeen (the poor)” [al-Tawbah 9:60]
Thirdly: 
The above applies only to a wife giving her zakah to her husband. With regard to a husband giving his zakah to his wife, Ibn al-Mundhir said: They (the scholars) are unanimously agreed that a man should not give his zakah to his wife, because he is obliged to spend on her, which means that she does not need zakah.",Islam Q&A
43252,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43252,The reason why the husband is regarded as superior and is given the role of qawwaam (protector and maintainer),"I am a Muslim girl, praise be to Allah. I have read a lot and I have heard the scholars speak about the husband’s rights over his wife, and how great he is. I have heard ahaadeeth which speak sternly about a woman disobeying her husband. I want to obey the commands of Allah and His Messenger when I get married, if Allah wills, but I have a question, if I may ask about it. This question is going around in the minds of many women, but they are too embarrassed to ask them lest they be accused of ignorance or of denying the command of Allah and His Messenger. The question is: what is it that makes the man superior so that he deserves all these rights over women?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The great rights that a husband has over his wife are something that is affirmed in sharee’ah, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable, but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise” [al-Baqarah 2:228] 
“Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allah and to their husbands), and guard in the husband’s absence what Allah orders them to guard (e.g. their chastity and their husband’s property). As to those women on whose part you see ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (next) refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful); but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). Surely, Allah is Ever Most High, Most Great” [al-Nisa’ 4:34] 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If I were to command anyone to prostrate to anyone other than Allah, I would have commanded women to prostrate to their husbands. By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, no woman can fulfil her duty towards Allah until she fulfils her duty towards her husband. If he asks her (for intimacy) even if she is on her camel saddle, she should not refuse.”
Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 1853; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah.  
And there are other similar texts. 
Allah has explained the reason in the verse where He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means” [al-Nisa’ 4:34]
This superiority is something that Allah has decreed, and He is not to be questioned about what He does, rather they are to be questioned. It is also because of what the man does, spending on his family and striving to earn a living for them. 
Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafseer (1/363):  “The phrase ‘but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them’ means that they are superior in physical nature, attitude, status, obedience to the commands of Allah, spending, taking care of interests, and virtue, in this world and in the Hereafter, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means’ [al-Nisa’4:34].” End quote. 
He also said (1/653): “Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Men are the protectors and maintainers of women’ meaning that men are in charge of women, i.e., they are their leaders, who rule over them and discipline them if they go astray. ‘because Allah has made one of them to excel the other’ means, because men are superior to women, and men are better than women. Hence Prophethood was given to men only, as is the highest position of authority (i.e., khilaafah or the position of caliph), because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No people will ever succeed who appoint a woman as their ruler.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari from the hadeeth of ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Abi Bakr from his father. The same applies to the position of judge etc. ‘and because they spend (to support them) from their means’ means, because of the mahr, spending and maintenance that Allah has enjoined upon men with regard to women in His Book and in the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). So men are better than women in and of themselves, and they have the responsibility to spend on them and maintain them, so it is appropriate that the man should be the protector and maintainer of the woman, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them’, i.e., they are in charge of them. She should obey him in that which he commands her to do, and obeying him means treating his family well and protecting his wealth.” End quote. 
Al-Baghawi said in his Tafseer (2/206):  “ ‘because Allah has made one of them to excel the other’ means, men excel women because they have more powers of reason and religious commitment and they are in charge of affairs. And it was said that this refers to giving testimony, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And if there are not two men (available), then a man and two women’ [al-Baqarah 2:282].  And it was said that it refers to jihad, or to worship i.e., Jumu’ah and prayers in congregation, or that it refers to the fact that a man may marry four wives, but a woman is not permitted more than one husband; or the fact that divorce is in the man’s hand; or that it refers to inheritance, or to diyah (blood money), or to Prophethood.” 
Al-Baydaawi said in his Tafseer (2/184): “ ‘Men are the protectors and maintainers of women’ means that they are in charge of them and take care of them. He gave two reasons for that, one that is inherent in them and one that is acquired subsequently, and said: ‘because Allah has made one of them to excel the other’, because Allah has favoured men over women by making men more perfect in reasoning and running affairs, and has given them more strength with regard to work and acts of worship. Hence men are singled out when it comes to Prophethood, leadership, guardianship, establishing rituals, giving testimony in legal matters, the obligation to engage in jihad and pray Jumu’ah, and so on, and they are given a greater share of inheritance, and divorce is in the man’s hand. ‘and because they spend (to support them) from their means’ refers to what they spend with regard to marriage, such as the mahr and maintenance, etc.” End quote. 
In conclusion, men have been given the role of protectors and maintainers for the two reasons mentioned in the verse, one of which is inherent i.e., Allah has made men superior to women, and the other of which is acquired by the man through his own hard work, which his spending his wealth on his wife.

43268,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43268,There is nothing wrong with giving the entire fidyah to one poor person,Is it permissible for one who is unable to fast to feed one poor person for thirty days or to feed thirty poor persons on one day?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The one who is unable to fast on an ongoing basis is obliged to feed one poor person for each day that he does not fast, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskeen (poor person) (for every day)” [al-Baqarah 2:18 ]
Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: This has not been abrogated. It refers to an old man or old woman who is not able to fast; they should feed one poor person for each day. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4505. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“With regard to how this feeding is to be done, it may be done in two ways: 
1 – Making food and inviting the poor to come and eat, according to the number of days that one has to cover, as Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) used to do when he grew old. 
2 – Giving them uncooked food. 
Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/335. 
See also question no. 49944. 
With regard to feeding one poor person for thirty days, many scholars have stated that this is permissible. This is the view of the Shaafa’i and Hanbali madhhabs and of a group of Maalikis. It says in al-Insaaf (3/291): It is permissible to give food to one poor person all in one go. 
See Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj, 3/446; Kashshaaf al-Qinaa’, 2/313. 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (10/198): 
Since the doctors have ruled that this sickness that you are suffering from is ongoing, and you cannot fast as a result, and there is no hope of recovery, then you have to feed one poor person for each day, giving half a saa’ of the local staple food, whether it is dates or something else. If you give the poor person dinner or breakfast for the number of days that you owe, that will be sufficient. 
From this it is known that it is permissible to feed one poor person for thirty days, or to gather thirty poor persons on one day and feed them. And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
43270,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43270,Ruling on saying that the attitude of the kuffaar is better than the attitude of the Muslims,Is it permissible for a Muslim to say that some of the kuffaar have a better attitude than some of the Muslims?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.If you say that the attitude of the kuffaar is better than the attitude of the Muslims – in absolute terms – then this is haraam, no doubt about it. In fact the one who says that should be asked to repent, because the most important attitude is a person’s attitude towards Allaah, and correct etiquette towards Him means not worshipping anyone other than Him. This attitude is to be found only among the Muslims and not others, and this general usage includes all the Muslims, and there must be some of them who have a proper Islamic attitude and follow the laws of Allaah. 
But preferring the attitude of some of the kaafirs to the attitude of some Muslims is a mistake, because the bad attitude of the kuffaar towards their Lord, may He be exalted, and their Prophets (peace be upon them) is bad enough. They insulted Allaah and claimed that He has a son, and they slandered their Prophets and told lies about them. What good can their attitude towards people do them when their attitude towards their Lord is among the worst of attitudes? 
Moreover, how can we look at the attitude of ten or one hundred kaafirs, and determine from that that their attitude is good, and forget the attitude of most of the Jews and Christians? How often have they betrayed the Muslims, how often have they destroyed their homes, how often have they tempted them away from their religion, how often have they destroyed their wealth [?], how often have they plotted and conspired against them? 
The good attitude of a few of them does not count against the bad attitude of most of them, let alone the fact that this good attitude of their serves the same purpose, for they only want to benefit themselves and serve their own worldly interests, in most cases. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about someone who was comparing Muslim workers to non-Muslim workers. He said: the non-Muslims are honest and I can trust them, and their demands are few and their work is good, but those (Muslims) are the exact opposite – so what is your opinion? 
He said: They are not Muslims in the true sense of the word even though they claim to be Muslims. Those who are Muslims in the true sense of the word are better and more honest and more sincere than the kuffaar. What you said is a mistake and you should not say it. If the kuffaar are honest with you and fulfil their trusts so as to get what they want from you and to take jobs from our Muslim brothers, this is their only goal. They may pretend to be serving your interests but in fact they are only serving their own interests so that they can take money and so that you will prefer them.  
What you have to do is only employ good Muslims.  If you see Muslims who are not righteous then advise them and guide them. Then if they follow the right path, all well and good, otherwise you should send them back to their countries and bring others. Ask the agent who chooses employees for you to choose good people who are known to be honest, and who are known to pray and be righteous, and not to choose just anyone.  
Undoubtedly this is a trick of the Shaytaan, whereby he says to you: These kaafirs are better than the Muslims, or are more honest, and so on. All of that is because the enemy of Allaah and his troops know of the great evil that results from employing kuffaar instead of Muslims. So he makes that idea attractive to them and encourages them to employ non-Muslims and leave the Muslims, and even to employ enemies of Allaah, thus giving precedence to this world over the Hereafter. There is no power and no strength except with Allaah. 
I have even heard that some of them say that the Muslims pray and miss work because of their prayers, and the kuffaar do not pray so they do more work. This is like what we have mentioned above; it is a very serious matter to regard the Muslims’ prayer as something objectionable and to employ kaafirs because they do not pray. Whatever happened to faith and piety? Whatever happened to fear of Allaah? How can you criticize your Muslim brothers for praying? We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound. 
Fataawa Noor ‘ala al-Darb 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about describing the kuffaar as honest, trustworthy and good workers. 
He replied: Even if that is true, their lies, deceit, betrayal and theft are far worse than what is found in some Muslim countries. This is well known. If it is true, these are qualities that are advocated by Islam, and the Muslims should be striving harder to acquire these characteristics so that they may acquire a good attitude as well as earning reward. But the kuffaar only aim to achieve material gains by means of these attitudes, so they are honest in their dealings so as to attract others to them. 
But if the Muslim acquires these characteristics, in addition to material purposes he also seeks to fulfil a shar’i aim, which is to acquire faith and earn reward from Allaah. This is the difference between the Muslim and the kaafir. 
With regard to the claims about honesty in kaafir countries – whether eastern or western – if this is true, it is only a little of goodness in comparison to the great evil, even if it is nothing more than the fact that they deny the rights of the One Whose rights are the greatest of all, namely Allaah – may He be exalted and glorified. “joining others in worship with Allaah is a great Zulm (wrong) indeed” [Luqmaan 31:13 – interpretation of the meaning]. No matter how much good these kaafirs may do, it is still greatly outweighed by their bad deeds, kufr and wrongdoing, so there is no goodness in them.
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 3. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: The help of the ahl al-dhimmah (non-Muslims living under Muslim rule) should not be sought in government work or record-keeping, because that leads to many evil consequences. Ahmad was asked about the report of Abu Taalib with regard to collecting taxes, and he said: Their help should not be sought in anything. 
Al-Fataawa al-Kubra, 5/539 
It says in Fath al-‘Ali al-Maalik fi Fatwa ‘ala Madhhab Maalik: Preferring a kaafir to a Muslim is apostasy if that is on the basis of religion, otherwise it is not. (2/348).

43274,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43274,He thought that hastening to depart from Mina early meant leaving it even if one has not stoned the Jamaraat,"We hastened to leave Hajj early and departed from Mina before sunset, so that we would not have to stay until the third day. After leaving Mina we came back and stoned the jamaraat after sunset. Is what we did permissible? Is it essential for the one who wants to leave early to stone the jamaraat before sunset on the second day, or does the stoning have nothing to do with it, and is leaving before sunset what matters? What should we do, if we have made a mistake?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    This understanding of the word ta’ajjul (hastening) is not 
    correct, especially since for a pilgrim to “hasten” means that he leaves 
    Mina before sunset on the second of the days of al-tashreeq, after having 
    stoned the jamaraat. Simply leaving Mina before sunset does not count as 
    “hastening” if he has not stoned the jamaraat, especially if he comes back 
    after sunset to stone them. 

    The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 

    If the pilgrim stones the Jamaraat on the twelfth day after 
    the sun has passed its zenith, then departs to Makkah or elsewhere before 
    the sun sets, he does not have to stone the Jamaraat on the thirteenth, and 
    it is not prescribed for him to do so.

    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah 
    wa’l-Ifta’, 11/274. 

    Commenting on the verse (interpretation of the meaning), 
    “And remember Allaah during the appointed Days. But whosoever hastens to 
    leave in two days, there is no sin on him and whosoever stays on, there is 
    no sin on him, if his aim is to do good and obey Allaah (fear Him)” 
    [al-Baqarah 2:203], the scholars of the Standing Committee said: 

    With regard to the meaning of what is mentioned in the verse: 
    whoever hastens to depart from Mina after spending two nights there 
    following the Day of Sacrifice, and after stoning the three jamaraat on the 
    eleventh and twelfth, there is no sin on him and he does not have to offer a 
    (compensatory) sacrifice, because he has done what is required of him. 
    Whoever tarries in Mina and spends the night of the thirteenth there and 
    stones the three jamaraat on the thirteenth, there is no sin on him either, 
    rather his staying in Mina on this night and stoning the jamaraat on this 
    day is better and brings a greater reward, because the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did that.

    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah 
    wa’l-Ifta’, 11/267. 

    Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan said: 
The minimum length of 
    stay in Mina during the days of Hajj is the eleventh and twelfth – the two 
    days after Eid – and this is what is meant by hastening to leave. But it is 
    better to stay on the thirteenth too, which is what is meant by staying on. 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “But whosoever hastens to leave in two days, there is no 
    sin on him and whosoever stays on, there is no sin on him, if his aim is to 
    do good and obey Allaah (fear Him)” 

    [al-Baqarah 2:203]

    Hastening to leave means going away from Mina after stoning 
    the Jamaraat on the twelfth day after the sun has passed its zenith and 
    before the sun sets. If sunset comes and a person has not left Mina yet, he 
    is obliged to stay there on the night of the thirteenth and stone the 
    jamaraat after Zuhr on the thirteenth. And Allaah knows best. 

    Fatwa no. 16386 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked: 

    A pilgrim did not stone the jamaraat on the twelfth because 
    he thought that this was part of hastening to leave Mina, and he did not 
    stay overnight in Mina or perform tawaaf al-wadaa’ out of ignorance. 

    He replied: 

    Your Hajj is valid, because you did not omit any pillar or 
    essential part of the Hajj, but you omitted three obligatory duties. The 
    first was staying overnight in Mina on the night of the thirteenth. The 
    second was stoning the jamaraat on the twelfth. The third was performing 
    tawaaf al-wadaa’ (the farewell tawaaf). According to the scholars, if a 
    person omits this tawaaf during Hajj, he has to offer a compensatory 
    sacrifice, to be slaughtered in Makkah and its meat distributed to the poor. 
    But not staying overnight in Mina for one night does not require a 
    compensatory sacrifice. 

    I would like to take this opportunity to draw the attention 
    of my pilgrim brothers to this mistake made by our brother who asked the 
    question, because many pilgrims take the words of Allaah “But whosoever 
    hastens to leave in two days” to mean leaving Mina on the eleventh, so 
    they count the two days as the day of Eid and the eleventh, but that is not 
    how it is, rather this is a misunderstanding, because Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And remember Allaah during the appointed Days. But 
    whosoever hastens to leave in two days, there is no sin on him” 
    

    [al-Baqarah 2:203]

    The appointed days (al-ayyaam al-ma’doodaat) are the 
    ayyaam al-tashreeq, the first of which is the eleventh. Based on this, the 
    words of Allaah “But whosoever hastens to leave in two days” mean two 
    of the days of al-tashreeq, i.e., on the twelfth. We have to make sure that 
    we understand such matters correctly so that we will not make mistakes.
