47513,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47513,Ruling on taking part in building a resort village,I work as a civil engineer in a company that takes on major contracts. The company has asked me to travel to a large resort city to build a resort village there. What is the ruling on that? Please note that I will lose my job if I refuse. May Allaah reward you with good.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It is well known that building a resort village involves a 
    number of things that go against sharee’ah, such as making it easy for 
    people to indulge in mixing, wanton display, unveiling, nakedness, alcohol, 
    riba (usury) and many other things that are known to those who work in this 
    area. 

    The resort villages in your country, especially in the area 
    mentioned, are well known for the many haraam things that go on there.  

    As that is the case, taking part in building these resorts or 
    helping in that comes under the heading of cooperating in sin and 
    transgression. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, 
    righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and 
    transgression”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:2]
If a person sits with 
    those who are committing sin and does not condemn it, then he bears the same 
    burden of sin as they do, just for sitting with them. Similarly the one who 
    sits with those who mock the signs (or verses) of Allaah bears the same 
    burden of sin as they do, even if he does not mock with them, as Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning):  
“And it has already 
    been revealed to you in the Book (this Qur’aan) that when you hear the 
    Verses of Allaah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until 
    they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) 
    certainly in that case you would be like them. Surely, Allaah will collect 
    the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell”
[al-Nisa’ 4:140]
If this is the case of 
    one who sits with them, then how about one who helps them to build the 
    houses in which they will commit evil and disobey Allaah, or houses in which 
    they will mock the signs of Allaah and so on! 
You have to advise your 
    bosses that what they are doing is haraam, and that they are partners in 
    sin. If they do not respond, then excuse yourself from doing this work for 
    any reason. For example, you could ask them to transfer you to another site where something permissible is being built, or you could say that it is too far away, or you could take an official holiday. 
If you cannot do that –  but we do not think that the matter will go that far, in sha Allaah – then look for another job. I ask Allaah to help you to do the right things, for the burdens of this world are lighter than the punishment of the Hereafter.

47516,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47516,What Do Muslims Think about the Gospels?,"It is well known among us Muslims that Allah revealed the Gospel (Injil) to `Isa (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but when I studied some things about Christianity, they told me that the Gospel was not brought by the Messiah, rather it was written by the disciples of the Messiah after the crucifixion (or after Allah raised him up to Him, as it says in the Quran). How can we reconcile between the two views?","1.	Muslims believe that Allah revealed the Gospel (Injil) to His Prophet `Isa (Jesus). Muslims also believe that, apart from the Quran, no book remained as it was revealed by Allah, neither the Gospel nor anything else.
2.	There are four Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Christians agreed that Luke and Mark did not see the Messiah (peace be upon him), rather he was seen by Matthew and John. The four Gospels were written by these men after the Messiah had been taken up into heaven.","What Do Muslims Think about the Gospels?


Disbelieving in that or doubting it is misguidance and disbelief in Allah


Does the original Gospel exist today?


Who wrote the Gospels and when were they written?","Praise be to Allah.There is no contradiction between the two views such that we would need to ask how they can be reconciled. Rather the reason why the questioner is confused is that he is mixing up two things that we must believe in and that are both true, praise be to Allah. 
What Do Muslims Think about the Gospels?
The first issue is to believe that Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, revealed a Book to His Prophet `Isa (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and that the name of this book was the Gospel (Injil) . These are basic principles of faith that we must believe in. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The Messenger (Muhammad) believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books , and His Messengers. (They say,) `We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers’ — and they say, `We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all)’.” [Al-Baqarah 2:285]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Jibril (peace be upon him), when he asked him about faith, as mentioned in the well-known Hadith: “Faith means to believe in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Last Day, and to believe in His divine will and decree, both good and bad.” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) 
Disbelieving in that or doubting it is misguidance and disbelief in Allah
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Believe in Allah, and His Messenger (Muhammad), and the Book (the Quran) which He has sent down to His Messenger, and the Scripture which He sent down to those before (him); and whosoever disbelieves in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Last Day, then indeed he has strayed far away. Verily, those who believe, then disbelieve, then believe (again), and (again) disbelieve, and go on increasing in disbelief; Allah will not forgive them, nor guide them on the (right) way.” [An-Nisa’ 4:136-137] 
“Verily, those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messengers and wish to make distinction between Allah and His Messengers (by believing in Allah and disbelieving in His Messengers) saying, “We believe in some but reject others,” and wish to adopt a way in between. They are in truth disbelievers. And We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating torment.” [An-Nisa’ 4:150-151]
Does the original Gospel exist today?
The second issue is the Gospel or, more precisely, the Gospels that the Christians have today. Although one of the basic principles of our faith is to believe in the Gospel that was revealed to `Isa (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), we also believe that, apart from the Quran, no book remained as it was revealed by Allah, neither the Gospel nor anything else . Even the Christians themselves do not believe that the books which they have were revealed in that form from Allah, nor do they claim that the Messiah wrote the Gospel, or at least that it was written during his lifetime. 
Imam Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) says in Al-Fasl Fil-Milal (2/2): 
“We do not need to try hard to prove that the Gospels and all the books of the Christians did not come from Allah or from the Messiah (peace be upon him), as we needed to do with regard to the Torah and the books attributed to the Prophets that the Jews have, because the Jews claim that the Torah that they have was revealed from Allah to Moosa, so we needed to establish proof that this claim of theirs is false. 
With regard to the Christians, they have taken care of the issue themselves, because they do not believe that the Gospels were revealed from Allah to the Messiah, or that the Messiah brought them, rather all of them from first to last, peasants and kings, Nestorians, Jacobites, Maronites and Orthodox are all agreed that there are four historical accounts written by four known men at different times. 

The first of them is the account written by Matthew the Levite who was a disciple of the Messiah. He wrote it nine years after the Messiah was taken up into heaven. He wrote it in Hebrew in Judaea in Palestine, and it filled approximately twenty-eight pages in a medium-sized script. 
The next account was written by Mark, a disciple of Simon ben Yuna, who was called Peter. He wrote it twenty-two years after the Messiah was taken up into heaven. He wrote it in Greek in Antioch in the land of the Byzantines. They say that Simon is the one who wrote it, then he erased his name from the beginning of it and attributed it to his disciple Mark. It filled twenty-four pages written in a medium-sized script. Simon was a disciple of the Messiah. 
The third account written was that of Luke, a physician of Antioch who was also a disciple of Simon Peter. He wrote it in Greek after Mark had written his account, and is similar in length to the Gospel of Matthew. 
The fourth account was written by John the son of Zebedee, another disciple of the Messiah, sixty-odd years after the Messiah had been taken up into heaven. He wrote it in Greek, and it filled twenty-four pages in a medium-sized script.”

Who wrote the Gospels and when were they written?
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymyiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Jawab As-Sahih (3:21): 
“With regard to the Gospels that the Christians have, there are four Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. They agree that Luke and Mark did not see the Messiah; instead, he was seen by Matthew and John. These four accounts which they call the Gospel, and they call each one of them a Gospel, were written by these men after the Messiah had been taken up into heaven. They did not say that they are the word of Allah or that the Messiah conveyed them from Allah, rather they narrated some of the words of the Messiah and some of his deeds and miracles.”
Moreover, these books which were written after the time of the Messiah did not remain in their original form. The original versions were lost long ago. 
Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“With regard to the Christians, there is no dispute among them, or anyone else, that only one hundred and twenty men believed in the Messiah during his lifetime… and all of those who believed in him concealed themselves and were afraid during his lifetime and afterwards. They called people to his religion in secret and none of them disclosed himself or practised his religion openly, because any of them who was caught was executed. 
They continued in this manner, not showing themselves at all, and they had no place where they were safe for three hundred years after the Messiah was taken up into heaven . 
During this time, the Gospel that had been revealed from Allah disappeared, apart from a few verses which Allah preserved as proof against them and as a rebuke to them, as we have mentioned. Then when the Emperor Constantine became a Christian, then the Christians prevailed and started to practise their religion openly and assemble in safety. 
If a religion is like this, with its followers practising it in secret and living in constant fear of the sword, it is impossible for things to be transmitted soundly via a continuous chain of narrators, and its followers cannot protect it or prevent it from being distorted .” (Al-Fasl, 2/4-5) 
In addition to this huge disruption in the chain of transmission of their books, which lasted for two centuries, these books did not remain in the languages in which they were originally written, rather they were translated, more than once, by people whose level of knowledge and honesty is unknown. The contradictions in these books and their shortcomings are among the strongest evidence that they have been distorted and that they are not the Gospel (Injil) that Allah revealed to His slave and Messenger `Isa (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Allah indeed spoke the truth when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein many contradictions.” [An-Nisa’ 4:82].

    dignified, and observe proper hijab, and take care to speak only about what 
    is necessary without saying anything more, or softening the voice. There 
    should also be no danger of fitnah.  If the woman feels any kind of desire

47564,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47564,Can he tell lies to his parents in order to increase their good deeds?,"When I get some money from my father or mother, I give it in charity and keep a little. When I ask them for money they say, “Where did your money go?” I tell them a lie and say that I bought stuff with it. The reason why I tell this lie is that I want Allaah to increase their good deeds. Is it permissible for me to lie to them or should I tell them the truth?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      The basic principle concerning telling lies is that it is 
      one of the signs of the hypocrites, because the Prophet  (peace and 
      blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The signs of the hypocrite are 
      three: when he speaks, he lies, when he makes a promise he breaks it, and 
      when he is entrusted with something he breaks that trust.” Narrated by 
      al-Bukhaari, 32; Muslim, 89. 

    But there are some instances in which Islam permits lying, if 
    that serves a greater purpose or wards off a greater harm: 

    These cases include the following: 

    1-When a person is intermediating 
    in order to bring about reconciliation between two disputing parties.

    2-When a man speaks to his wife, 
    or a wife to her husband, concerning matters that will increase the love 
    between them.

    3-War.

    It was narrated from Umm Kulthoom bint ‘Uqbah that she heard 
    the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    say: “He is not a liar who brings about reconciliation among people, conveys 
    good words and says good things.” 

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2546; Muslim, 2605 

    It was narrated that Asma’ bint Yazeed said: The Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Lies are not 
    appropriate except in three cases: when a man speaks to his wife to please 
    her, telling lies at times of war, and lying in order to bring about 
    reconciliation between people.” 

    Shaykh al-Albaani said: it is hasan. 

    What you have mentioned is no excuse for telling lies to your 
    family. If you are honest with them they will never be deprived of the 
    reward for spending on you. And you can combine your family’s spending on 
    you and their giving in charity to the needy by encouraging them to spend 
    for the sake of Allaah, with no need to tell lies about buying stuff when 
    you have not done so.  

    We ask Allaah to correct your intention and set your affairs 
    straight, and to reward you greatly for your desire to benefit your family.

47565,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47565,causes of apathy and the remedy for that,"What is the best solution for apathy in faith after a person used to fear Allaah, then he became apathetic and can no longer read Qur’aan?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There are several causes of apathy and before dealing with the problem we have to pause and find out the cause. There are several ways of finding out the cause and dealing with apathy. 
Some of these causes are: a weak relationship with Allaah, laziness in worship, keeping company with careless people, being distracted by this world and its delights, and not thinking about the end of this world and the consequences of being ill-prepared to meet Allaah. 
As for how to treat the Muslim who has been afflicted by apathy in worship, there are several ways of doing so including the following: 
1 – Strengthening his relationship with his Lord, by reading the Qur’aan and pondering its meanings, realizing the greatness of Allaah by seeing the greatness of His Book, thinking about the greatness of His names and attributes and actions. 
2 – Regularly offering naafil prayers and persisting in doing so, even if they are few, because one of the greatest causes of the Muslim becoming apathetic is when he starts to do acts of worship and does a great deal in the beginning. This is not the way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and is not what he advised his ummah to do. ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) described his actions as ongoing, i.e., not interrupted or infrequent. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us that, “The most beloved of actions to Allaah are those which are done persistently, even if they are little.” If a Muslim wants not to be afflicted by apathy, then let him strive to do a small action persistently, because this is better than doing a lot infrequently. 
3 – Striving to keep company with righteous and active people. A man who is energetic (in worship and Islamic activities) will make you more active and lazy people do not like active companions. So look for active friends who strive to memorize Qur’aan, seek knowledge and call people to Allaah. Friends like that will encourage you to worship and will show you the way to good things. 
4 – Read books that tell the stories of active people so that you will have good examples in your journey towards Allaah. For example, ‘Uluw al-Himmah by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ismaa’eel al-Muqaddim; Salaah al-Ummah fi ‘Uluw al-Himmah by Shaykh Sayyid ‘Afaani. 
5 – We advise you to make du’aa’, especially in the latter part of the night. The one who turns to his Lord and seeks His help to remain steadfast in worshipping Him and to worship Him well will never be let down.
We ask Allaah to help you to do that which pleases Him and to guide you to the best attitudes, words and deeds.

If it is obligatory, is it obligatory for attractive and beautiful women only or for all Muslim women?","Hijab is compulsory on all Muslim women who have reached the age of puberty. Many of the women of the Muhajirin and Ansar were known to be blessed with beauty, but no one thought that this ruling applied only to them and not to others.","Is hijab compulsory in Islam?


Is hijab for beautiful women only?","Praise be to Allah.Is hijab compulsory in Islam?
Hijab is obligatory for all Muslim women who have reached the age of puberty. In the answer to question no. 12525 you will find an explanation that the face is ‘awrah. We have already quoted the evidence that it is obligatory to cover it in the answer to question no. 21134  and 21536 . In the answer to question no. 11774  you will find detailed evidence stating that hijab is obligatory for all women. This general obligation is indicated by the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed. And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [al-Ahzab 33:59]
The women of the Muhajirin and Ansar obeyed that command. 
‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “May Allah have mercy on the first Muhajir women. When Allah revealed the words ‘and to draw their veils all over Juyubihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)’ [al-Nur 24:31] they tore their aprons and covered their faces (ikhtamarna) with them.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4480; Abu Dawud, 4102)
What is meant by ikhtamarna is covering the face, as al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar stated in al-Fath, 8/490. 
It was narrated that Umm Salamah said: When the words ‘draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies’ were revealed, the women of the Ansar went out as if there were crows on their heads because of the way they covered themselves. (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4101; classed as sahih by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)
Is hijab for beautiful women only?
Undoubtedly many of the women of the Muhajirin and Ansar were known to be blessed with beauty, but no one thought that this ruling applied only to them and not to others. 
These ahadith show that the women of the Muhajirin and Ansar obeyed the command to cover their faces and they did not understand the command as applying only to those who were beautiful.  
The scholars have explained that this ruling is general in meaning and applies to all women. 
In his commentary on the verse ‘draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies’, al-Jassas al-Hanafi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“This verse indicates that young women are commanded to cover their faces in front of strangers (non-mahram men) and to be modest when they go out lest people with suspicious minds raise their hopes when they see them.” (Ahkam al-Quran, 5/245)
Ibn Jazi al-Kalbi al-Maliki (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The Arab women used to uncover their faces as slave women do, which was an invitation to men to look at them. So Allah commanded them to cover themselves with their jilbabs and cover their faces with them.” (Al-Tas-hil li ‘Uloom al-Tanzil, 3/144) 
Shaykh al-Islam ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “It is not permissible for women to uncover their faces where non-mahrams can see them. The people in authority have to enjoin what is good and forbid this evil and others. Whoever does not obey should be punished for that in a way that will deter him (from doing it again).” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 24/382)
Al-Suyuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“This is the verse of hijab which applies to all women and shows that they are obliged to cover their heads and faces.” (‘Awn al-Ma'bud, 11/106)
