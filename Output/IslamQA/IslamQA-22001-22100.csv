22003,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22003,"His son got to know a girl through chat rooms, and he wants to marry her","My adult son who is twenty-one years old got to know a girl in another city through chat rooms. They kept in touch through the chat rooms, then he spoke to her on the phone and he liked her and she liked him. The relationship between them developed over a number of months until they agreed to marry, knowing that – according to what he tells me – they have not met. Then he asked me to arrange his marriage to this girl, but at first he did not make it clear to me that he had gotten to know her through chat rooms. At first he went to his paternal aunt who has a job and spoke to her confidentially, and he asked her to say that she knew this girl through one of her female colleagues at school and to get in touch with the girls’ mother and tell her that his family was keen to get to know them with a view to arranging a marriage with one of their womenfolk. His aunt indeed did that, but I absolutely refused to agree to his request to marry her for a number of reasons: 

1 – The way in which he got to know this girl was not Islamically acceptable.

2 – He does not know a lot about how she really is. All that he knows about her is through telephone calls only.

3 – He lied to me at first, and went to his aunt about a sensitive subject which should have been kept secret even from the closest of people until arrangements were complete, then it could be announced to others.

4 – We – praise be to Allaah – are a conservative family, and this way of getting in touch with a girl is not in accordance with our principles and values, let alone our traditions and customs. 

To sum up, I am very confused about this matter, because now it is affecting his university studies and he has become withdrawn. 

Please note that he was previously a high-achieving student. Every time we try to tell him to forget about this matter and to focus on his studies, he insists that if we agree to let him marry this girl it will make him happy again, and that we will accept this girl and like her.

What is your opinion on this confusing problem?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    This problem – and many others – confirm the truth of what 
    many daa’iyahs and reformers are saying about the necessity of being careful 
    about how our sons and daughters are using the internet, and to beware of 
    entering conversations between men and women in chat rooms, because of the 
    very real fitnah (temptation] to which that may lead, with subsequent 
    contact and meetings. 

    Undoubtedly your son made a mistake by forming this 
    relationship with a non-mahram woman who is not permissible for him. He made 
    a mistake by lying to you and by discussing this matter with his aunt. But 
    we do not agree with the idea of refusing his marriage to this girl, 
    especially if you think that your son is deeply attached to her. That is for 
    the following reasons: 

    1 – Not every girl who acts in this manner can be judged to 
    be deviant, badly brought up or of bad manners and attitude. This may have 
    been a mistake on her part, as in the case of your son. 

    2 – What is happening to your son now, with his wanting to be 
    alone and his falling behind in his studies may be because of intense love 
    for this girl on his part. In such cases it may be that the only efficient 
    remedy is for him to marry the one whom he loves. According to a hadeeth 
    narrated by Ibn Maajah (1847), “There is nothing better for two who love one 
    another than marriage.” (This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in
    Saheeh Sunan Ibn Maajah). 
3 – The fact that your 
    son does not know much about the attitude and character of this girl may be 
    dealt with by asking about her and finding out more about her background. 

    Hence we think that you should hasten to find out about this 
    girl and her family. If her character is not good, then this will convince 
    your son to stop thinking about her. 

    But if, after thoroughly investigating the matter, you like 
    what you find out about her and her family, then there is no reason why your 
    son should not marry her, rather this will be the best remedy for him and 
    for her. 

    This suggestion applies if you feel that he is strongly 
    attached to her and is keen to marry her, as referred to above. But if it is 
    simply the matter of an idea that has occurred to him, and it is not the 
    matter of love or deep attachment, and you hope that he will forget about 
    her, then be firm in your refusal and help him to look for a woman who has 
    good manners and is religiously committed and chaste. There are so many 
    righteous and chaste women who have never had anything to do with men and 
    have never faced temptation. 

    Turn to Allaah and ask Him to guide you, and seek His help by 
    praying Istikhaarah concerning all the matters in which you want to take a 
    decision.

22004,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22004,There is no basis for Hijr Ismaa’eel being so called,Did ismail alaihi al salam burried this mother hager in higr ismail.. as i hearded saying from one of our sheik,,,"Praise be to Allah.First of all we should point out that there 
    is no basis for the people calling Hijr Ismaa’eel by this name, and Ismaa’eel knew nothing of this Hijr. Ibraaheem and Ismaa’eel (peace be upon 
    them) built the Ka’bah completely, including the area of the Hijr, then the walls of the Ka’bah became weakened because of a fire and flood that 
    happened before the mission of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) began. So Quraysh knocked down what was left of its 
    walls and rebuilt it. They ran out of money from good sources and were thus unable to complete the building on the foundations of Ibraaheem and 
    Ismaa’eel (peace be upon them), so they left the Hijr outside, and built a small wall around it to indicate that it was part of the Ka’bah. They 
    had stipulated for themselves the condition that nothing should be used for building it except money from good sources, and that the earnings of 
    prostitutes or profits from interest-based sales could not be used, or money that was acquired wrongfully by anyone. 
In al-Saheehayn it is narrated that 
    ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “I asked the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about the wall – is it part 
    of the House? He said, ‘Yes.’ I said, ‘Why did they not incorporate it into the House?’ He said, ‘Your people ran out of money.’” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1584; Muslim, 1333. 
“The wall” here refers to the Hijr. 
The correct way is to call it al-Hijr, 
    without attributing it to Ismaa’eel (peace be upon him). 
It is not proven in any marfoo’ hadeeth that 
    Ismaa’eel (peace be upon him) was buried in this Hijr, or that Haajar was buried in it.  But there are mawqoof reports with weak isnaads which may 
    be understood as meaning that the grave of Ismaa’eel is inside the Hijr. 
For more information see Tahdheer 
    al-Saajid min Ittikhaadh al-Quboor Masaajid (Warning to Worshippers against Taking Graves as Places of Worship) by Shaykh al-Albaani (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him),  p. 75, 76. 
It is extremely unlikely that Ismaa’eel 
    (peace be upon him) would have buried his mother inside the Ka’bah, or that his sons would have buried him there. Such a suggestion needs proof, 
    and no such thing has been proven, praise be to Allaah.

Conditions of accepting invitations in Islam


Can you accept invitations for gatherings filled with backbiting, slander, etc.?","Praise be to Allah.Rights of a Muslim over another 
It was narrated by Al-Bukhari (1164) and Muslim (4022) that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: ‘The rights of a Muslim over his fellow Muslim are five : returning greetings, visiting the sick, attending funerals, accepting invitations, and saying Yarhamuk Allah (may Allah have mercy on you) when he sneezes.’” 
Categories of invitation which Muslims may accept
The scholars divided invitations which a Muslim is commanded to accept into two categories: 

Invitation to a wedding party (Walimah). The majority of scholars said that it is obligatory to accept such an invitation, unless there is a legitimate Shar`i excuse – some such excuses will be mentioned below. 

The evidence that it is obligatory to accept these invitations is the Hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari (4779) and Muslim (2585) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The worst kind of food is the food of a wedding feast that is withheld from those who would come (the poor) and to which people (the rich) are invited who may refuse it. Whoever does not accept the invitation has disobeyed Allah and His Messenger.” 

Invitation to various kinds of gatherings other than wedding-feasts. The majority of scholars say that accepting these invitations is commendable, and no one differed from that apart from some of the Shafi`is and Dtahiris, who said it is obligatory. If we say that it is strongly commendable, then this is close enough. And Allah knows best.  

Conditions of accepting invitations in Islam
The scholars have stipulated conditions for accepting an invitation; if these conditions are not met then it is not obligatory or commendable to accept the invitation, rather it may be prohibited to attend. These conditions were summed up by Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him), who said: 

There should be nothing objectionable in the place where the party etc. is to be held. If there is something objectionable and it is possible to change it, then it is obligatory to attend for two reasons: to accept the invitation and to change the objectionable thing. If it is not possible to change it then it is prohibited to attend.
The host should not be someone whom it is obligatory or recommended to forsake (such as one who openly commits immoral actions or sin, where forsaking him may be of benefit in bringing about his repentance). 
The host should be a Muslim. If he is not, then it is not obligatory to accept the invitation, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The rights of a Muslim over his fellow Muslim are five…”
The food offered should be permissible for us to eat.
Accepting the invitation should not lead to neglecting a more important duty; if that is the case then it is prohibited to accept the invitation.
It should not cause any trouble to the person who is invited. For example, if he needs to travel or to leave his family who need him there, and so on. (Al-Qawl Al-Mufid, 3/111)

Some scholars added: 

If the host issued a general invitation, saying that everyone is welcome, then it is not obligatory to accept the invitation.

Can you accept invitations for gatherings filled with backbiting, slander, etc.?
From the above it should be clear to you that you do not have to accept such invitations, rather it may be prohibited for you to do so, if you cannot change the reprehensible things or if your attending the gatherings will affect your duties towards your husband and children and prevent you from taking care of them as you are supposed to do. 
Moreover, you will not be safe from their evil and harm. This is an excuse which frees you from having to accept invitations that you are obliged to accept, let alone those which are not obligatory at all. 
Women should also note that they have to ask their husband’s permission to go out to parties etc. to which they are invited. You should advise these sisters to try to make the best use of their time and their gatherings in ways that will benefit them either in religious or worldly terms. For the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned us of the consequences of attending gatherings in which Allah is not mentioned. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No people sit in a gathering in which they do not remember Allah or send blessings upon their Prophet, but they will regret it, if He wills He will punish them and if He wills He will forgive them.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 3302; he said, this is an authentic Hadith. It was also classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Tirmidhi, 3/140)  
In Sunan Abu Dawud (4214) and other books, it is narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘People who get up from an assembly in which they did not remember Allah, will conclude it as if it has foul odour similar to that of a rotten carcass of a donkey. And it will be a cause of grief to them.” (Classed as authentic by An-Nawawi in Riyadh Al-Salihin, 321, and by Al-Albani) 
Convey this advice to them, either verbally or in writing. In addition, you could invite them to your house and make the most of this opportunity to hold a study circle, in addition to doing some permissible things that they will like. Perhaps Allah will make you the means of starting a good trend of benefiting from such gatherings.

22010,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22010,She found out that the man with whom she did the marriage contract does not pray regularly and he mixes with women,"Two years ago I went to XXX and my parents had my nikah done. We haven't consumated the marriage but it was done this way so that it would help him to come here sooner and also so that we could go places together, when a mehram isn't present.  Over the years I found some very disturbing things that I didn't have any knowledge about before.  To give you some examples before my nikah I was assured that my husband prayed and was a good muslim.  I found out that this was not the case and he only prayed on Fridays. I don't want to make the mistake that I have seen others gone through where both husband and wife differ.  My parents said they have left the desicion up to me and that they are not going to have any say.  I don't know whether I should stay in this marriage or not?  How do I know if I'm making a mistake?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If the marriage contract has been completed, with the 
    proposal and acceptance and with the presence of the wali (guardian) and two 
    witnesses, then the woman becomes the wife of the man, then she has 
    obligations like any other wife. He has the duties of providing maintenance 
    and accommodation, and has the right to physical intimacy etc. If the man 
    does not pray the five daily prayers, then he is a kaafir and the marriage 
    to him is invalid, even if he prays Jumu’ah. His visiting bad websites and 
    keeping mixed company are sins which he must give up, but that does not mean 
    that the marriage is invalid so long as this does not cause any harm to the 
    wife and children by exposing them to these things. Warding off evil takes 
    precedence over gaining benefits. Whatever the case, the main concern has to 
    do with the matter of his prayers. You have to make sure that the husband is 
    praying regularly, because the one who does not pray is a kaafir and it is 
    not permissible for a Muslim woman to stay married to him.",Shaykh ‘Abd al-Kareem al-Khudayr

Is it fair that a man can have sex with his wife everyday but the wife can only have sex every four months with her husband? (after all it is not like she can marry another man to satisfy her needs, but her husband has ample room to satisfy his needs).",,,"Praise be to Allah.This action is undoubtedly wrong, and it is 
    contrary to good treatment of one's wife. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and live with them honourably”
[al-Nisa 4:19] 
“And they (women) have rights (over their 
    husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable”

“The best of you are those who are best to 
    their wives.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3895; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.  
It follows from this that the husband has to 
    have intercourse with his wife in the manner that is sufficient to meet her needs. It is not a part of living with her honourably to forsake her 
    for this length of time, namely four months. If that causes harm to the woman, then she has the right to demand an annulment of the marriage, 
With regard to the comment made by some of the scholars, that the husband only has to have intercourse with his wife once every four months, this is a weak view, for which there is no clear saheeh (sound) evidence. The correct view is that he has to have intercourse with his wife as often as will satisfy her needs, because of the shar’i principles mentioned above.",Dr. Khaalid ibn ‘Ali al-Mushayqih
22027,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22027,Prevention of pregnancy using the coil,Is it permissible to use the coil (IUD or intrauterine device) to prevent pregnancy?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Using the coil is permissible subject to two conditions:
The first condition is that it should not cause harm to the woman.
The second condition is that her husband should give his permission for that.
We would like to remind women that a woman should not do things to prevent pregnancy, because this goes against the aims of sharee‘ah. It is better for her to remain as Allah created her, bearing lots of children, because having lots of children serves a great purpose and does not harm a person in his provision, in raising them or in health.
But if a woman is physically weak and is very sick, such that having a child every year would harm her, in this case she is excused if she takes something to prevent pregnancy. But she has to have her husband’s permission to use that which will prevent pregnancy, and using it should not cause any harm.
Hence it is prescribed in Islam for a man to marry a woman who is loving and fertile, i.e., she should be one of the women who are known to have many children, so that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) may feel proud of the great numbers of his ummah, and the numbers of Muslims may be increased thereby.

A number of scholars have stated that it is haraam to look at any of the books of the People of the Book, except for those who have deep knowledge, because we are commanded neither to believe nor disbelieve what they tell us about stories that are not present in our religion. There is no guarantee that the ordinary person who has no knowledge will not end up believing in falsehood and rejecting the truth. Moreover, man is weak and specious arguments may take root in the heart and it may be difficult to get rid of them. The following fatwa was issued by the Standing Committee: 
“A great deal of distortion, addition and subtraction has befallen the previous divinely-revealed scriptures, as Allah has stated, so it is not permissible for a Muslim to read them and study them, unless he is one who has deep knowledge and is seeking to explain the distortions and contradictions therein.” (3/311). 
So whatever Christian books have come to you, you must hasten to get rid of them. 
With regard to what you say about Alexander the Great, this is a specious argument which is indicative of the stupidity and ignorance of the Christians. We may respond to that from several angles, as follows: 
1 – There is no mention in the Qur’aan of how long Dhu’l-Qarnayn (Alexander) lived, or of the era in which he lived. 
2 – Dhu’l-Qarnayn who is mentioned in the Qur’aan is not Alexander the Macedonian or Greek who built Alexandria. This Alexander is the one who died at the age of 33, as mentioned in the Christian books. He lived 323 years before the birth of the Messiah (peace be upon him). 
Dhu’l-Qarnayn who is mentioned in the Qur’aan lived at the time of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him), and it is said that he became Muslim at the hands of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him), and he went on pilgrimage to the Ka’bah walking. The scholars differed concerning him, as to whether he was a Prophet or a righteous slave and just king, but they agree that he was a Muslim, a monotheist (believer in Tawheed) and one who was obedient to Allah. 
The correct view is to refrain from stating what he was, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I do not know whether Tubba’ was a Prophet or not, and I do not know whether Dhu’l-Qarnayn was a Prophet or not.” 
(Narrated by al-Haakim and al-Bayhaqi; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 5524). 
3 – The difference between this righteous slave, and the Macedonian Alexander who was a kaafir, is well known to Muslim scholars. Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Badaayah wa’l-Nahaayah (1/493): 
“It was narrated that Qutaadah said: Alexander was Dhu’l-Qarnayn and his father was the first of the Caesars, and he was one of the descendants of Saam ibn Nooh (Shem the son of Noah). As for Dhu’l-Qarnayn, he was Alexander son of Philip… ibn Roomi ibn al-Asfar ibn Yaqaz ibn al-‘Ees ibn Ishaaq ibn Ibraaheem al-Khaleel. This is the genealogy of him given by al-Haafiz ibn ‘Asaakir in his Taareekh. (He is known as) the Macedonian, the Greek, the Egyptian, builder of Alexandria, on the events of whose life the Greeks based their calendar. He came much later than the first Alexander. This was approximately three hundred years before the Messiah. The philosopher Aristotle was his minister and he is the one who killed Daar ibn Daar (Darius) and humiliated the kings of Persia and invaded their land. 
We have drawn attention to him because many people think that they are one and the same and that the one who is mentioned in the Qur’aan is the one whose minister was Aristotle, which has resulted in a lot of mistakes and far-reaching corruption. The former was a righteous believing slave and a just king, and the latter was a mushrik and his minister was a philosopher. There were more than two thousand years between the two, so what comparison can there be between them? They are not alike at all and they have nothing in common, except in the mind of a fool who does not know anything.” 
4 – The Christians have no information in their holy book about the second Alexander, let alone the first. All they have is the story of the visions of Daniel, which they claim refer to the rule of this infidel Alexander, and the division of his kingdom after his death. 
5 – If we assume that there is a difference between what the Qur’aan says and what their book says about a person or an event, why should that be regarded as strange? There are many such differences, especially in the stories of the Prophets such as Ibraaheem (Abraham), Nooh (Noah), Loot (Lot), Moosa (Moses), Dawood (David) and ‘Eesa (Jesus) (peace be upon them). The Christians have no reliable and continuous chain of narration for this book in which they believe, and they know nothing about those who translated it. Moreover it contains dozens of contradictions which effectively nullify any claim to infallibility or to have been written with inspiration from the Holy Spirit.

22031,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22031,Taking a female servant for Hajj with no mahram for her,"We have a female servant at home without a mahram. I will be performing the obligatory duty of Hajj next year, in sha Allah, and I would like to take the servant with my family to perform Hajj, and I will take care of all her needs. Is it permissible to take her with us, as she will not be able to go for Hajj except with us? Please advise us, may Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
Before replying to this question, I would like to warn our brothers whom Allaah has blessed in this country with abundance of wealth and good things against persistently bringing female servants in, because this is a kind of luxury and is indeed a kind of extravagance. We even hear of some cases where there is no one but a man and his wife at home, and the woman is able to take care of all the household affairs, but they still bring a female servant. I warn my brothers against this serious problem which has become a matter of competition among people, where a wife will say that she wants a servant so the husband goes and brings her a servant. My advice is that no-one should bring a servant except in cases of extreme necessity.

My view is that even in cases of necessity, only Muslim servants should be brought in, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded that the Jews and Christians be expelled from the Arabian Peninsula. If a servant is brought in, she should not be young and pretty, because she is a source of temptation, especially if there are young men in the family. For the Shaytaan flows through the son of Adam like blood. And no female servant should be brought without her mahram, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade women to travel without their mahrams.

If the servant has a mahram, then the problem mentioned in the question does not arise; her mahram can go for Hajj with her. But if she does not have a mahram, or if her mahram brought her then went back, then they should not take her for Hajj or travel with her; rather she should stay with someone who can be trusted to take care of her. If there is no one who can be trusted to take care of her, then she may go for Hajj with them because of necessity, and her Hajj will be valid.

 1 – when anger is so intense that are person is no longer aware of what he is doing or saying, and becomes like one who is insane or mad. In this case the talaaq (divorce) does not count, according to all the scholars, because he is like one who is insane and mad, who has lost all power of reason.
 2 – when his anger is intense but he understands what he is saying and doing, but his anger is intense and he cannot control himself because the argument trading of insults or fighting has gone on too long, so his anger may be intense because of that. In this case there is a difference of opinion among the scholars, but the most correct view is that divorce does not count in this case either, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no divorce and no freeing of slaves when it is done by force or in a state of intense anger.” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 2046; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Irwa’, 2047)
 3 – mild anger, which is what happens when the husband is upset with his wife, or he is disappointed about something that his wife has done, but it is not so intense that it makes him lose his power of reasoning or self-control. Rather it is the ordinary kind of anger and is mild. In this case the divorce is valid according to the all the scholars.

22037,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22037,Is it better for the seeker of knowledge to stay with only one shaykh?,"Al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadi mentioned one of the aspects of seeking knowledge, which is to stay with  one of the scholars or one of the shaykhs. What is your opinion?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked this question, and he replied: 
It is good if a person focuses on one shaykh and makes him his main source, especially if he is a young beginner, for if the young beginner seeks knowledge from a number of people he will be confused. For people are not all of one opinion, especially nowadays. In the past, here in the Kingdom (Saudi Arabia) people never deviated from [the books] al-Iqnaa’ and al-Muntahaa, so their fatwaas were all the same and the bases of their fatwaas were all the same; no one differed from another, except in his delivery and style. But now, everyone who has memorized a hadeeth or two says, “I am the imaam to be followed. Imaam Ahmad was a man and we are men.” So now there is chaos. Everyone is issuing fatwaas and sometimes you hear fatwaas from these people which may you weep and laugh at the same time. I was thinking of recording these fatwas, but I was afraid that this might make me one of those who seek out their faults of their brothers, so I did not do it lest we transmit things that are as far from the truth as the earth is from the Pleiades.  
I say: adhering to one scholar is very important when the seeker of knowledge is just starting out, so that he will not be confused. Hence our shaykhs forbade us to read al-Mughni and Sharh al-Muhadhdhab and other books which contain numerous opinions when we were starting out. One of our shaykhs told us that Shaykh ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman Baabiteen (may Allah have mercy on him), who was one of the great shaykhs of Najd, only read al-Rawd al-Murabba’ and never read anything else. He read it repeatedly but he discussed it in great detail and in great depth. 
If a person has gained a great deal of knowledge, then he should look at the views of the scholars so as to benefit from them in both academic and practical terms. But when one is just starting out, my advice is to focus on one particular scholar and not go to anyone else.","From Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, Kitaab al-‘Ilm, p. 107"

22044,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22044,Learning English for the purpose of da’wah,"What is your view on a seeker of knowledge learning English, especially if he wants to use it for da’wah and calling others to Allaah?",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen 
          (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked this question. He replied as 
          follows. 
 
          Our view on learning English is that 
          it is a means and it is a bad menans if the aim is bad. But the one 
          thing that we must avoid is using it instead of Arabic. That is not 
          permitted. We have heard some foolish people speaking English instead 
          of Arabic, and some of the foolish people who are dazzled by the west, 
          whom I regard as lackeys (of the west), teaching their children to use 
          the greetings of the non-Muslims, and teaching them to say “bye-bye” 
          when departing, and so on. 
 
          Because using this language instead of 
          Arabic, which is the language of the Qur’aan and the noblest of languages, 
          is haraam. It was narrated that the salaf forbade speaking in the tongues 
          of the non-Arabs. 
 
          With regard to using it as a means of 
          da’wah, there is no doubt that this is obligatory sometimes. I did not 
          learn it and I wish that I had learned it. On some occasions I have 
          found forced to use an interpreter who could not fully express what 
          I wanted to say. 
 
          I will tell you a story of something 
          that happened to me in the mosque of Jeddah airport, with some men from 
          the Islamic Awareness organization. After Fajr prayer, we were speaking 
          about the Tijaani sect and how it is a false sect that that apostatized 
          from Islam. I started to say what I knew about them, then a man came 
          and asked me for permission to interpret my words into Hausa.  
          I gave him permission, and he started to interpret. Then a man came 
          rushing in and said, “This man who is interpreting for you is praising 
          the Tijaaniyyah.” I was astonished and I said, “Inna Lillaahi wa 
          inna ilayhi raaji’oon (Truly, to Allaah we belong and truly, to 
          Him we shall return).” If I had known this language I would not have 
          needed these cheaters. The point is that knowing the language of the 
          people whom you are addressing is undoubtedly important so that you 
          can convey the information to them. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
          meaning): 
 
          “And We sent not a Messenger except with 
          the language of his people, in order that he might make (the Message) 
          clear for them”

          Allaah, then protecting yourself by means of marriage. If you cannot 
          get married, then you have to fast, for it will be a shield for you.

          I say that this is undoubtedly jihad 
          for the sake of Allaah, for a person to study these theories that go 
          against Islam in order to refute them from a standpoint of knowledge.

          Muslim, Kitaab al-Eemaan, 29). He told him about them so that 
          he would be prepared to deal with them. Similarly, the scholars who 
          studied these matters, such as Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, who studied 
          various branches of knowledge and philosophical issues and the like 
          so that he could refute their proponents. 
 
          If you are studying these matters in 
          order to refute them, and you are confident that you are able to refute 
          them without being affected by them, because you worship Allaah much 
          and fear Him, then I hope in sha Allaah that this will be good for you 
          and of benefit to the Muslims. But if you cannot refute them in a rational

          not completely certain and deeply convinced, then I advise you to leave 
          these matters alone, for they are dangerous. No one should expose himself

This includes: 
1 – Evidence from the Quran: 
Allah says (interpretation of the meanings): 
“but the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother’s food and clothing on a reasonable basis” [al-Baqarah 2:233]
“Let the rich man spend according to his means; and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allah has given him”
[al-Talaaq 65:7] 
“and whatsoever you spend of anything (in Allah’s Cause), He will replace it. And He is the Best of providers”
[Saba’ 34:39]
2 – Evidence from the Sunnah: 
There are many reports from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning the virtue of spending on one’s wife and children, especially daughters. For example, Muslim (995) narrated from Abu Hurayrah in a marfoo’ report: “A dinar which you spend for the sake of Allah, a dinar which you spend on freeing a slave, a dinar which you give in charity to a poor person and a dinar which you spend on your family – the greatest of these in reward is that which you spend on your family.” 
It was narrated by Muslim (994) and others from Thawbaan, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in a marfoo’ report: “The best dinar which a man can spend is a dinar which he spends on his children, a dinar which he spends on his riding beast for the sake of Allah, and a dinar which he spends on his companions for the sake of Allah.” Abu Qilaabah said: he started with one’s children, then Abu Qilaabah said, what man earns a greater reward than one who spends on his small children so as spare them from having to beg or so that Allah may benefit them through him and make them independent? 
In Saheeh al-Bukhaari (1295) and Saheeh Muslim (1628) it is narrated from Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqaas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: “You will never spend anything seeking the Face of Allah thereby, but you will be rewarded for it, even (the food) that you put in your wife’s mouth.” 
In al-Bukhaari (55) and Muslim (1002) it is narrated from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When a man spends on his family, hoping for reward, that is (counted as) an act of charity for him.” 
In al-Saheehayn (al-Bukhaari, 1442, Muslim, 1010), it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “there is no day on which people wake up but two angels come down. One of them says, ‘O Allah, compensate anyone who spends’ and the other says, ‘O Allah, destroy the one who withholds.’” 
In al-Saheehayn (al-Bukhaari, 1418; Muslim, 2629) it is narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “A woman entered upon me and she had her two daughters with her. She asked me [for food] and I did not have anything except one date. I gave it to her and she shared it between her daughters and did not eat any of it herself. Then she got up and left. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came in and I told him (what had happened). He said, ‘Whoever is tested with any of these girls and he treats them kindly, they will be a shield for him against the Fire.’”
In Muslim (2630) it is also narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “A poor woman came to me carrying her two daughters, and I gave her three dates. She gave each of them a date, and raised one date to her mouth to eat it. Then her daughters asked her for more food, so she split the date that she had wanted to eat between them. I was impressed by her action and I told the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) what she had done. He said, ‘Because of that, Allah has guaranteed Paradise for her, or saved her from Hell.’” 
In Muslim (2631) it is narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever sponsors (takes care of) two girls until they reach adulthood, he and I will come on the Day of Resurrection (like this)” – and he put his fingers together.
And there are many similar ahaadeeth. And Allah knows best. 
(Adapted from Ghidha’ al-Albaab, 2/437) 
Ibn Battaal (may Allah have mercy on him) said: he should spend on himself, on his wife and on those on whom he is obliged to spend without being stingy or extravagant in that, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor niggardly, but hold a medium (way) between those (extremes)” [al-Furqaan 25:67]

Self-discipline in Islam","Praise be to Allah.The path to self-discipline in Islam
Acknowledging your shortcomings is one of the first steps in disciplining yourself . 
Whoever acknowledges that he has shortcomings has started on the path to self-discipline. This acknowledgement is one of the things that make us discipline ourselves and be persistent in doing so. This acknowledgement should not put you off disciplining yourself. It is a sign of Allah’s care when a person tries to change himself and develop, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, Allah will not change the condition of a people as long as they do not change their state themselves” [Al-Ra’d 13:11]
So whoever tries to change for the sake of Allah, Allah will help him to change. 
Each person is individually responsible for his own self, and will be questioned individually, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Gracious (Allah) as a slave.
Verily, He knows each one of them, and has counted them a full counting.
 And everyone of them will come to Him Alone on the Day of Resurrection (without any helper, or protector or defender)” [Maryam 19:93-95]
Man cannot benefit from what he has been told about goodness unless he himself takes an interest in that. Do you not know the story of the wife of Nuh and the wife of Lut, who were members of the households of two prophets, one of whom was one of the messengers of strong will? Imagine how these prophets strove to guide their wives and how much guidance these wives received, but there was no interest on their part, so it was said to both of them: 
“Enter the Fire along with those who enter!” [Al-Tahrim 66:10 – interpretation of the meaning]
Whereas the wife of Pharaoh – even though she was a member of the household of one of the greatest evildoers – is presented by Allah as an example to those who believe because she disciplined herself. 
Self-discipline in Islam
The ways in which a Muslim can discipline himself are as follows: 

Worshipping Allah, keeping in contact with Him and submitting to Him. That is done by paying attention to doing obligatory acts of worship well, and cleansing your heart of any attachment to anything other than Allah.
Reading Quran a great deal, pondering its meanings and seeking to understand it.
Reading useful religious books that describe the ways of treating and cleansing the heart, such as Mukhtasar Minhaj al-Qasidin, Tahdhib Madarij al-Salikin and so on; reading the biographies of the salaf (pious predecessors) and learning about their attitude and behaviour, such as Sifat al-Safwah by Ibn al-Jawzi and Ayna nahnu min Akhlaq al-Salaf by Baha al-Din ‘Aqeel and Nasir al-Jalil.
Attending educational programs such as classes and lectures.
Making good use of your time and using it to do things that will be of benefit in both worldly and spiritual terms
Not indulging too much in permissible things and not paying too much attention to them.
Keeping company with righteous people and looking for righteous companions, who can help you to do good . Those who live alone will miss out on a lot of the characteristics of a good brother such as preferring others to oneself and being patient.
Trying to act on what you learn and put it into practice.
Checking closely on yourself.
Having confidence in yourself – whilst relying on Allah – because the one who has no confidence cannot act.
Despising yourself for not doing enough for the sake of Allah. This does not contradict the things mentioned above. Man has to strive hard whilst still thinking that his efforts are not enough.
Practising withdrawal or isolation as prescribed in shari’ah (Islamic law). You should not mix with people all the time, rather you must have some time which you spend alone, in worship as prescribed in Islam.

We ask Allah to help us and you to discipline ourselves and submit to that which Allah loves and is pleased with. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and Companions.
And Allah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
