9903,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9903,Should one kill snakes and scorpions whilst praying?,"If a man starts to pray, and this prayer is one of the obligatory prayers, and he sees a snake or scorpion in front of him, can he stop his prayer and kill that thing, or should he complete his prayer?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, he can stop his prayer and kill the snake or scorpion, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Kill the two black ones during prayer, the snake and the scorpion.”
(Narrated by the authors of Sunan and classed as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan).
If you can kill it whilst still praying, without moving more than what is regarded as acceptable, then this is OK and the prayer is still valid.
And Allaah is the source of strength. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions, and grant them peace.","Al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Iftaa, 7/31"
9905,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9905,The misguidance of the Jews with regard to ‘aqeedah,"we know where the christians went wrong, where did the jews go wrong ?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly 
          the mistakes that the Jews made are more serious than those which the 
          Christians made, although both of them have erred and are kaafirs. The 
          Qur’aan mentions a number of the ways in which the Jews went astray.
 1.Among them there is a group which claims that Allaah has a son, 
          as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And 
          the Jews say: ‘Uzair (Ezra) is the son of Allaah, and the Christians 
          say: Messiah is the son of Allaah. That is their saying with their mouths, 
          resembling the saying of those who disbelieved aforetime. Allaah’s Curse 
          be on them, how they are deluded away from the truth!” 
[al-Tawbah 9:30] 
 2.They described Allaah as having shortcomings, and they killed 
          the Prophets and Messengers of Allaah, as Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning): 
“The Jews say: ‘Allaah’s Hand is 
          tied up (i.e. He does not give and spend of His Bounty).’ Be their hands 
          tied up and be they accursed for what they uttered. Nay, both His Hands 
          are widely outstretched. He spends (of His Bounty) as He wills” 
[al-Maa’idah 5:64] 
“Indeed, 
          Allaah has heard the statement of those (Jews) who say: ‘Truly, Allaah 
          is poor and we are rich!’ We shall record what they have said and their 
          killing of the Prophets unjustly, and We shall say: ‘Taste you the torment 
          of the burning (Fire).’” 
[Aal ‘Imraan 
          3:181] 
 3.They distorted the word of 
          Allaah, i.e., the Tawraat (Torah). Allaah says (interpretation of the 
          meaning): 
“So, 
          because of their breach of their covenant, We cursed them and made their 
          hearts grow hard. They change the words from their (right) places” 
[al-Maa’idah 5:13] 
“Then woe to those who write the 
          Book with their own hands and then say, “This is from Allaah,” to purchase 
          with it a little price! Woe to them for what their hands have written 
          and woe to them for that they earn thereby” 
[al-Baqarah 2:79] 
 4.They deserved the curse of Allaah, because of what Allaah has 
          said about them. Allaah says: 
“Those among the Children of 
          Israel who disbelieved were cursed by the tongue of Dawood (David) and 
          ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary). That was because they disobeyed 
          (Allaah and the Messengers) and were ever transgressing beyond bounds.
They used not to forbid one another 
          from Al-Munkar (wrong, evildoing, sins, polytheism, disbelief) which 
          they committed. Vile indeed was what they used to do” 
[al-Maa’idah 5:78-79] 
 The 
          lies that they have fabricated against their Prophets are many, such 
          as the following: 
1.The Jews claimed that the Prophet of Allaah Sulayman (Solomon) 
          was an apostate and that he worshipped idols, as mentioned in I Kings 
          11:5. 
2.The Jews claimed that Loot (Lot) – peace be upon him – drank 
          wine and committed incest with his two daughters, as mentioned in Genesis 
          19:30ff.
3.The Jews claimed that the Prophet of Allaah Ya’qoob (Jacob) committed 
          theft, as mentioned in Genesis 31:12.
4.The Jews claim that the Prophet of Allaah Dawood (David) committed 
          adultery, as a result of which Sulaymaan (Solomon) was born to him, 
          as mentioned in II Samuel 11:4.
-- 
          and so on, may Allaah curse them and put them to shame. 
Allaah 
          and His Messenger cursed them in numerous places in the Qur’aan and 
          Sunnah because of their shameless actions. For example, Allaah says 
          (interpretation of the meanings): 
“And 
          they say, ‘Our hearts are wrapped (i.e. do not hear or understand Allaah’s 
          Word).’ Nay, Allaah has cursed them for their disbelief, so little is 
          that which they believe. 
And when there came 
          to them (the Jews), a Book (this Qur’aan) from Allaah confirming what 
          is with them [the Tawraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], although 
          aforetime they had invoked Allaah (for coming of Muhammad) in order 
          to gain victory over those who disbelieved, then when there came to 
          them that which they had recognized, they disbelieved in it. So let 
          the Curse of Allaah be on the disbelievers”
[al-Baqarah 
          2:88-89] 
 “Among 
          those who are Jews, there are some who displace words from (their) right 
          places and say: ‘We hear your word (O Muhammad) and disobey,’ and ‘Hear 
          and let you (O Muhammad) hear nothing.’ And Raa‘ina [in Arabic, 
          this means‘Be careful, listen to us, and 
          we listen to you’, whereas in Hebrew, it means ‘an insult’] 
          with a twist of their tongues and as a mockery of the religion (Islam). 
          And if only they had said: ‘We hear and obey’, and ‘Do make us understand,’ 
          it would have been better for them, and more proper; but Allaah has 
          cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not except a few. 
O 
          you who have been given the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Believe 
          in what We have revealed (to Muhammad) 
          confirming what is (already) with you, before We efface faces (by making 
          them like the back of necks; without nose, mouth and eyes) and turn 
          them hindwards, or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath-breakers. 
          And the Commandment of Allaah is always executed.” 
[al-Nisaa’ 
          4:46-47]
“So, 
          because of their breach of their covenant, We cursed them and made their 
          hearts grow hard. They change the words from their (right) places and 
          have abandoned a good part of the Message that was sent to them. And 
          you will not cease to discover deceit in them, except a few of them” 
          
[al-Maa’idah 
          5:13] 
 “Say 
          (O Muhammad to the people of the Scripture): ‘Shall I inform you of 
          something worse than that, regarding the recompense from Allaah: those 
          (Jews) who incurred the Curse of Allaah and His Wrath, and those of 
          whom (some) He transformed into monkeys and swines, and those who worshipped 
          Taaghoot (false deities); such are worse in rank (on the Day of Resurrection 
          in the Hell-fire), and far more astray from the Right Path (in 
          the life of this world).” 
[al-Maa’idah 
          5:60] 
“The 
          Jews say: ‘Allaah’s Hand is tied up (i.e. He does not give and spend 
          of His Bounty).’ Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for what 
          they uttered. Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched. He spends 
          (of His Bounty) as He wills. Verily, the Revelation that has come to 
          you from your Lord (Allaah) increases in most of them (their) obstinate 
          rebellion and disbelief. We have put enmity and hatred amongst them 
          till the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindled the fire of war, 
          Allaah extinguished it; and they (ever) strive to make mischief on the 
          earth. And Allaah does not like the Mufsidoon (mischief-makers). 
          
[al-Maa’idah 
          5:64] 
And 
          the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) said: 
“May 
          Allaah curse the Jews, for they have taken the graves of their Prophets 
          as places of  worship.” 
“May 
          Allaah curse the Jews: fat was forbidden for them, but they melted it 
          down and sold it,” 
These 
          two hadeeths are both narrated in Saheeh 
          al-Bukhaari. 
Ibn 
          al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) described them well when he 
          said: 
“The 
          nation upon whom is the Divine wrath are the Jews, the people of lies, 
          slander, betrayal, conspiracy and trickery, the killers of Prophets 
          and consumers of ribaa (usury) and bribes. They have the most evil hearts 
          of all nations, and the worst attitude. They are the farthest removed 
          from (divine) Mercy and the closest to (divine) wrath. Their way is 
          enmity and stirring up hatred. They represent the house of witchcraft, 
          lies and trickery. They do not see anything wrong in rejecting and disbelieving 
          in Prophets whom they did not like. With regard to a believer, they 
          respect not the ties, either of kinship or of covenant [cf. Al-Tawbah 
          9:10]. They do not respect the rights of those who agree with them, 
          or show any compassion towards them, nor do they show any justice or 
          fairness to those who work with them. There is no safety or security 
          for those who mix with them, and there is no sincerity towards those 
          who use their services. The most evil of them is the one who is most 
          intelligent, and the cleverest one among them is the one who cheats 
          the most. The one who is good at heart – which it is unlikely to find 
          among them – is not a Jew in any real sense. They are the most bad-tempered 
          of people, with the gloomiest houses and the filthiest courtyards. They 
          have very bad manners – their greeting is a curse, and meeting them 
          is bad news. Their slogan is wrath and they are filled with hatred.”

In my shock I severely beat them, but I don't know if what I did was correct. My two children have withdrawn from me and only speak to their mother, but rarely also. We are both worried. What is the best way to resolve this situation ? We need your help and advice!",,,"Praise be to Allah.The most important thing is for a father to deal wisely and in a balanced manner with his children’s mistakes. He should beware of letting his eagerness to deal with and correct the mistake cause him to make an even greater mistake. 
Children at this age may not understand the implications of such actions. What usually leads them to do such things is seeing certain things on TV. So we must try hard to know the source of this behaviour and where the children have learned it from, and we should try to protect them and keep them away from the sources of such things. 
The feelings that your children have will most likely disappear after a while, especially if you treat them gently and deal with them in a kind and loving manner.

 Do not forget to pay attention to the hadeeth (narration) of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “… And separate them in their beds” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, and classed as saheeh/sound by al-Albaani. See Saheeh Sunan Abi Dawood, 1/97)

“O Children of Adam! Let not Shaytaan (Satan) deceive you, as he got your parents [Adam and Hawwa’ (Eve)] out of Paradise, stripping them of their raiments, to show them their private parts
[al-A’raaf 7:27] 
  It was narrated that Bahz ibn Hakeem said, my father told me, from my grandfather, who said: “I said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, what about our ‘awrah (private parts)?’ He said, ‘Conceal your ‘awrah from everyone except your wife and female slaves whom your right hand possesses.’ He said, ‘ What about a man with another man?’ He said, ‘If you can manage not to let anyone see it, then do so.’ I said, ‘What if a man is on his own?’ He said, ‘Allaah is more deserving that you should be modest before Him.’” (Narrated by Abu Dawood. Classed as hasan by al-Albaani. See Saheeh Sunan Abi Dawood, no. 3391).

9911,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9911,Is it permissible to rebel against the ruler?,"There are people who think that because some of the rulers commit acts of kufr and sin, we are obliged to rebel against them and attempt to change things even if that results in harming the Muslims in that country, at a time when there are many problems in the Muslim world. What is your opinion?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The basic comprehensive principle of sharee’ah is that 
          it is not permitted to remove an evil by means of a greater evil; evil 
          must be warded off by that which will remove it or reduce it. Warding 
          off evil by means of a greater evil is not permitted according to the 
          scholarly consensus (ijmaa’) of the Muslims. If this group which wants 
          to get rid of this ruler who is openly committing kufr is able to do 
          so, and can bring in a good and righteous leader without that leading 
          to greater trouble for the Muslims or a greater evil than the evil of 
          this ruler, then that is OK. But if rebellion would result in greater 
          trouble and lead to chaos, oppression and the assassination of people 
          who do not deserve to be assassinated, and other forms of major evil, 
          then that is not permitted. Rather it is essential to be patient and 
          to hear and obey in matters of good, and to offer sincere advice to 
          the authorities, and to pray that they may be guided to good, and to 
          strive to reduce evil and increase good. This is the correct way which 
          should be followed, because that is in the general interests of the 
          Muslims, and because it will reduce evil and increase good, and because 
          this will keep the peace and protect the Muslims from a greater evil.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 8, p. 202"

9924,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9924,Ruling on a believer who commits some sins,What is the situation of a believer who commits many sins during his life? Will Allaah forgive him or will he be punished? What is the extent of his punishment?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If believers die believing in Allaah but having committed 
    sins less than major shirk that puts a person beyond the pale of Islam, one 
    of two scenarios may apply: 

    1 – they repented from those sins during their lives. If they 
    repented sincerely, Allaah will accept that from them, and they will once 
    again become like those who did not commit any sin, and they will not be 
    punished for their sins in the Hereafter. Indeed, their Lord may honour them 
    and turn their bad deeds (sayi’aat) into good deeds (hasanaat). 

    2 – those who die without having repented from their sins, or 
    whose repentance was imperfect and did not meet the required conditions, or 
    their repentance was not accepted. What is proven in the verses of the 
    Qur’aan and the Sunnah of the Prophet, and on which the righteous salaf was 
    agreed is that these – the sinners among those who believe in Tawheed (the 
    oneness of Allaah) – fall into three categories: 

    The first category: People who 
    have many hasanaat (good deeds) to their credit, which outweigh these 
    sayi’aat (bad deeds). Allaah will forgive them for their bad deeds and admit 
    them to Paradise. The Fire will never touch them, as a kindness and blessing 
    from Allaah. According to a hadeeth narrated by Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him), the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said:  “Allaah will bring the believer close and will shelter him with 
    His screen, then He will say, ‘Do you remember such and such a sin? Do you 
    remember such and such a sin?’ and he will say, ‘Yes, O Lord,’ until He 
    makes him confess his sins and he thinks that he is doomed. Then [Allaah] 
    will say, ‘I concealed it for you in the world and I forgive you for it 
    today.’ Then he will be given the book of his good deeds (hasanaat). But as 
    for the kaafir and the hypocrite, the witnesses will say, ‘These are the 
    ones who lied against their Lord!’ No doubt! the curse of Allaah is upon the 
    zaalimoon (wrongdoers) [cf. Hood 11:18].’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2441; 
    Muslim, 2768). 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “So as for those whose Scale (of good deeds) will be 
    heavy, they will be the successful (by entering Paradise)”[al-A’raaf 7:8]

    “Then as for him whose Balance (of good deeds) will be 
    heavy, 

    He will live a pleasant life (in Paradise)”[al-Qaari’ah 
    101:6-7]

    The second category: people 
    whose hasanaat and sayi’aat are equal, so their sayi’aat are enough to keep 
    them away from Paradise, but their hasanaat are enough to save them from 
    Hell. These are the people of al-A’raaf (a wall with elevated places) whom 
    Allaah says will stand between Paradise and Hell as long as Allaah wills, 
    then they will be granted permission to enter Paradise, as Allaah says after 
    telling us of the entrance of the people of Paradise to Paradise and the 
    people of Hell to Hell. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And between them will be a (barrier) screen and on 
    Al-A‘raaf (a wall with elevated places) will be men (whose good and evil 
    deeds would be equal in Scale), who would recognise all (of the Paradise and 
    Hell people), by their marks (the dwellers of Paradise by their white faces 
    and the dwellers of Hell by their black faces). And they will call out to 
    the dwellers of Paradise, ‘Salaamun ‘Alaykum’ (peace be on you), and at that 
    time they (men on Al-A‘raaf) will not yet have entered it (Paradise), but 
    they will hope to enter (it) with certainty.

    And when their eyes will be turned towards the dwellers of 
    the Fire, they will say: ‘Our Lord! Place us not with the people who are 
    Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers).’

     And the men on Al-A‘raaf (the wall) will call unto the 
    men whom they would recognise by their marks, saying: ‘Of what benefit to 
    you were your great numbers (and hoards of wealth), and your arrogance 
    (against Faith)?’

    Are they those, of whom you swore that Allaah would never 
    show them mercy. (Behold! It has been said to them): ‘Enter Paradise, no 
    fear shall be on you, nor shall you grieve’”[al-A’raaf 7:46-39]

    The third category:  People who 
    will meet Allaah persisting in committing major sins and acts of immorality, 
    so their sayi’aat will outweigh their hasanaat. These are the ones who will 
    deserve to enter Hell in a manner commensurate with their sins. Some of them 
    will be seized by the Fire as far as their ankles, some up to mid-calf, some 
    up to their knees, and for some only the mark of sujood will be spared. 
    These are the ones whom Allaah will permit to be brought forth from the Fire 
    because of the intercession of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him). He, all the Prophets, the angels, the believers and 
    whoever else Allaah wishes to honour will intercede for them. Whoever among 
    these sinners has more faith and committed less sins will have a lighter 
    punishment and remain in Hell for a shorter period and will be brought forth 
    sooner. Those whose sins were greater and whose faith was weaker, will have 
    a greater punishment and will remain for longer. We ask Allaah to keep us 
    safe and sound from all evils. 

    This is the situation of the sinful believers in the 
    Hereafter. 

    With regard to this world, so long as they do not do anything 
    that would put them beyond the pale of Islam, then they are believers whose 
    faith is lacking, as the righteous salaf agreed, basing that on the verses 
    of the Qur’aan and the ahaadeeth of the Prophet. These aayahs include: 

    “But if the killer is forgiven by the brother (or the 
    relatives) of the killed against blood money, then adhering to it with 
    fairness and payment of the blood money to the heir should be made in 
    fairness”

    [al-Baqarah 2:178 – interpretation of the meaning]

    So Allaah describes the killer as the brother of the heirs of 
    the victim. This brotherhood is the brotherhood of faith, which indicates 
    that the killer is not regarded as a kaafir, even though killing a believer 
    is one of the most serious of major sins. 

    And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And if two parties (or groups) among the believers fall 
    to fighting, then make peace between them both. But if one of them outrages 
    against the other, then fight you (all) against the one that which outrages 
    till it complies with the Command of Allaah. Then if it complies, then make 
    reconciliation between them justly, and be equitable. Verily, Allaah loves 
    those who are the equitable.

    The believers are nothing else than brothers (in Islamic 
    religion). So make reconciliation between your brothers, and fear Allaah, 
    that you may receive mercy”[al-Hujuraat 49:9-10]

    So Allaah described each of the fighting parties as 
    believers, even though fighting is a major sin. Indeed, He described the 
    ones who reconcile between them as being their brothers, which indicates 
    that the one who commits a major sin which does not reach the degree of 
    shirk and kufr is still regarded as a believer and comes under the rulings 
    on believers, but he is lacking in faith. In this way the shar’i texts may 
    be reconciled and support one another. And Allaah knows best.

Can a mother lead her son in prayer?","Praise be to Allah.Can a child lead prayer?
It is OK for a boy who understands the prayer to lead others in prayer, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “People should be led in prayer by the one who knows the most Quran among them.” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Masajid wa Mawadi’ al-Salah, 1078)
It was narrated in Sahih al-Bukhari that ‘Amr ibn Salamah al-Jarami said: “My father came from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said that he had heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, ‘When the time for prayer comes, let the one among you who knows the most Quran lead you in prayer.’ They looked and they did not find anyone who knew more Quran than me, so they made me lead them in prayer, and I was a boy of six or seven years.” (Al-Maghazi, 3963. See Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 7/389-390)
The evidence to be found in the hadith is that these Companions asked ‘Amr ibn Salamah to lead them in prayer when he was six or seven years old. This indicates that a boy who has reached the age of discernment can lead the prayers. If that were not permitted, there would have been Revelation to say that it was not allowed. (Ahkam al-Imamah wa’l-I-itimam fi’l-Salah by ‘Abd al-Muhsin al-Munif).
If your son fulfils all the conditions and obligations of the prayer, then there is nothing wrong with him leading you. 
Can a mother lead her son in prayer?
With regard to a woman leading a boy in prayer , this is not permissible, because he comes under the same rulings as a man. What is permitted is for a woman to lead other women in prayer , because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded Umm Waraqah bint ‘Abd-Allah ibn Nawfal to lead the members of her household – i.e., the women – in prayer.

9934,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9934,Further explanation of the ruling which says that it is permissible for kaafir women to see Muslim women without hijaab,"you said kaafir women can see you without hijaab,i'm not convinced since you mentioned only 1 hadeeth of aaishah (r.a)revealing herself to a jew.can you explain some more cause my inlaws are kaafirs?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Your 
    keenness to be modest in dress in front of kaafir women is something to be 
    commended and appreciated, especially at a time when there is so little 
    modesty and gheerah (protective jealousy – of men over their womenfolk) is 
    so weak. 
With regard 
    to the issue of kaafir women seeing what ordinarily appears of the Muslim 
    woman, this is an issue concerning which the Muslim scholars of the past and 
    present have differed. Under Question no. 2198 
    you will find a summary of what the scholars have said and the evidence for 
    each opinion. You will notice that those who say that it is permissible for 
    a kaafir woman to see a Muslim woman without hijaab have more than one piece 
    of evidence to support their view. 
But it is 
    worth pointing out the following: 
1 – If a 
    Muslim woman has saheeh evidence concerning some matter of sharee’ah, and 
    the evidence is clear and the meaning is apparent, then she should follow 
    it; it is not essential to have two or more pieces of evidence for every 
    issue. 
2 – If the 
    kaafir woman is not trustworthy and there is the fear that she may describe 
    the Muslim woman to her husband or say something that will harm her honour, 
    then the Muslim woman has to beware of her by wearing hijaab, not mixing 
    with her and so on. 
3 – The view 
    that Muslim women should wear hijaab in front of kaafir women is a valid 
    opinion and is correct to some extent. Many of the salaf (first generations 
    of Islam) expressed this view. So if a Muslim woman wants to be on the safe 
    side regarding her religion and follow this opinion, she may do that. It is 
    hoped that her caution and her keenness to avoid something doubtful will 
    bring good results. But she should not denounce those who differ from her in 
    that, so long as the matter is subject to ijtihaad and differences of 
    scholarly opinion, especially when there is no fear of fitnah from the 
    kaafir women. 
4 – Women 
    should not go too far in uncovering in front of their mahrams or Muslim 
    women, let alone in front of kaafir women. Rather they should not show any 
    more than that which ordinarily appears, namely the hands, calves, neck and 
    hair. Modesty is a branch of faith. You will find more details and further 
    explanation under Question no. 6596. And Allaah 
    knows best.

          is haraam according to the Qur’aan, Sunnah and scholarly consensus (ijmaa’). 
          Allaah has condemned this action and decreed an appropriate punishment 
          for it. The hadd punishment for a thief is to cut off his hand. Allaah 
          says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And 
          (as for) the male thief and the female thief, cut off (from the wrist 
          joint) their (right) hands as a recompense for that which they committed, 
          a punishment by way of example from Allaah. And Allaah is All Powerful, 
          All Wise” [al-Maa’idah 
          5:38]
The 
          Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
          Allaah be upon him) said: “The hand should be cut off for (the theft 
          of) a quarter of a dinar or more.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Hudood, 
          6291)  
The 
          Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
          Allaah be upon him) cursed the thief because he is a corrupt element 
          in society, and if he is left unpunished, his corruption will spread 
          and infect the body of the ummah. He  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “May Allaah curse 
          the thief who steals an egg and has his hand cut off, or steals a rope 
          and has his hand cut off.” (al-Bukhaari, al-Hudood, 6285).  
          
What 
          indicates that this ruling is definitive is that fact that a Makhzoomi 
          noblewoman stole at the time of the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and Usaamah ibn Zayd wanted 
          to intercede for her. The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) became angry and said, “Do 
          you intercede concerning one of the hadd punishments set by Allaah? 
          Those who came before you were destroyed because if a rich man among 
          them stole, they would let him off, but if a lowly person stole, they 
          would carry out the punishment on him. By Allaah, if Faatimah bint Muhammad 
          were to steal, I would cut off her hand.” (al-Bukhaari, Ahaadeeth 
          al-Anbiyaa’, 3216)  
This 
          is the ruling of Allaah concerning theft, that the hand should be cut 
          off from the wrist joint.  
Al-Nawawi 
          said in his commentary on Saheeh Muslim: Al-Shaafa'i, Abu Haneefah, 
          Maalik and the majority (of scholars) said: The hand should be cut off 
          from the wrist, where the hand meets the forearm. Al-Qurtubi said: all 
          the scholars said: The hand should be cut off from the wrist, not as 
          some of the innovators do when they cut off the fingers and leave the 
          thumb.  
Because 
          cutting off the hand is a serious matter, cutting off the hand of the 
          thief should not be done for just any case of theft. A combination of 
          conditions must be fulfilled before the hand of a thief is cut off. 
          These conditions are as follows:  
The 
          thing should have been taken by stealth; if it was not taken by stealth, 
          then (the hand) should not be cut off, such as when property has been 
          seized by force in front of other people, because in this case the owner 
          of the property could have asked for help to stop the thief.  
1-The stolen property should be something of worth, because 
          that which is of no worth has no sanctity, such as musical instruments, 
          wine and pigs. 
2-The value of the stolen property should be above a certain 
          limit, which is three Islamic dirhams or a quarter of an Islamic dinar, 
          or their equivalent in other currencies. 
3-The stolen property should have been taken from a place 
          where it had been put away, i.e., a place where people usually put their 
          property, such as a cupboard, for example. 
4-The theft itself has to be proven, either by the testimony 
          of two qualified witnesses or by the confession of the thief twice. 
          
5-The person from whom the property was stolen has to ask 
          for it back; if he does not, then (the thief’s) hand does not have to 
          be cut off.
If 
          these conditions are fulfilled, then the hand must be cut off. If this 
          ruling was applied in the societies which are content with man-made 
          laws and which have cast aside the sharee’ah of Allaah and replaced 
          it with human laws, this would be the most beneficial treatment for 
          this phenomenon. But the matter is as Allaah says (interpretation of 
          the meaning):
“Do 
          they then seek the judgement of (the days of) Ignorance? And who is 
          better in judgement than Allaah for a people who have firm Faith” [al-Maa’idah

Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan Abi Dawood, 530). Undoubtedly, giving women absolute freedom to go out is contrary to the commands of sharee’ah. Guardians have to be guardians in the fullest sense. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Men are the protectors and maintainers of women” [al-Nisa’ 4:34]
Women should not go out unless it is necessary, and when it is necessary for a woman to go out, it should be with her husband’s permission. She should be careful to avoid that which Allah has forbidden, and she should wear full hijaab, covering her face, etc. If she goes out wearing adornments and makeup or perfume, then this is not permitted. If there is no danger of fitnah and women go out in the manner required by sharee’ah, there is nothing wrong with their going out. Women at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to go out to the market-places without mahrams. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) permitted women to go out if there is an urgent need. He said, “It is permissible for you (women) to go out for your needs.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, Tafseer al-Quran, 4421).
Ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Baari, Ibn Battaal said: The interpretation of this hadeeth is that it is permissible for women to engage in dealings according to their needs.","Al-Fataawa al-Jaami’ah li’l-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 3/1063"

Blessed be Allah, the Wisest of judges. ((From the Introduction to Risaalat Ahkaam Mawaaqeet al-Salaah (Essay on the Rulings on the Times of the Prayers) by Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen, may Allah have mercy on him). 
Times of the five daily prayers 
The times of the prayers were mentioned by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the hadith: “The time for Zhuhr is from when the sun has passed its zenith and a man’s shadow is equal in length to his height, until the time for ‘Asr comes. The time for ‘Asr lasts until the sun turns yellow. The time for Maghrib lasts until the twilight has faded. The time for ‘Isha’ lasts until midnight. The time for Subh (Fajr) prayer lasts from the beginning of the pre-dawn so long as the sun has not yet started to rise. When the sun starts to rise then stop praying, for it rises between the two horns of the Shaytan.” (Narrated by Muslim, 612). 
This hadith explains the timings of the five daily prayers. As for defining them by the clock, that varies from one city or country to another. We will define each in more detail as follows: 
1 – The time of Zhuhr 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The time for Zhuhr is from when the sun has passed its zenith and a man’s shadow is equal in length to his height (this is the end time), until the time for ‘Asr comes.” So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) defined the start and the end of the time for Zhuhr: 
The start of the time for Zhuhr is when the sun has passed its zenith i.e., has passed the highest part of the sky and started to descend towards the west. 
Practical way of knowing when the zenith has been passed (and the time for Zhuhr has begun): 
Put a stick or pole in an open place. When the sun rises in the east, the shadow of this stick will fall towards the west. The higher the sun rises, the shorter the shadow will become. So long as it keeps growing shorter, the sun has not yet reached its zenith. The shadow will keep on growing shorter until it reaches a certain point, then it will start to increase, falling towards the east. When it increases by even a small amount, then the sun has passed its zenith. At that point the time for Zhuhr has begun. 
Knowing the time of the zenith by the clock: divide the time between sunrise and sunset in half, and that is the time of the zenith. If we assume that the sun rises at 6 a.m. and sets at 6 p.m., then the zenith is at 12 noon. If it rises at 7 a.m. and sets at 7 p.m., then the zenith is at 1 p.m., and so on. See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 2/96 
The end of the time for Zhuhr is when the shadow of everything is equal in length to the object itself, plus the length of the shadow of the object at the time of the zenith.  
Practical way of knowing when the time for Zhuhr has ended
Go back to the stick or pole which we described above. Let us assume that its length is one meter. We will notice that before the sun reached its zenith, the shadow decreased gradually until it reached a certain point (make a mark at this point), then it started to increase, at which point the time for Zuhr began. The shadow will continue to increase, falling towards the east until the length of the shadow is equal to the length of the object itself, i.e., it will be one meter long, starting from the point marked at the zenith). As for the shadow before the mark, that is not counted, and it is called fay’ al-zawaal (the shadow of the zenith). At this point the time for Zuhr ends and the time for ‘Asr begins straight away. 
2 – The time of ‘Asr 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The time for ‘Asr lasts until the sun turns yellow.” 
We know that the time for ‘Asr begins when the time for Zhuhr ends, i.e., when the length of an object’s shadow becomes equal to the length of the object itself. There are two times for the end of ‘Asr. 

The preferred time: this lasts from the beginning of the time for ‘Asr until the sun begins to turn yellow, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The time for ‘Asr lasts until the sun turns yellow.” Defining this time by the clock varies according to the season.
The time of necessity. This lasts from the time the sun turns yellow until sunset, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever catches up with one rak’ah of ‘Asr before the sun sets has caught up with ‘Asr.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 579; Muslim, 608) 

What is meant by the time of necessity? 
Necessity here refers to when a person is distracted from praying ‘Asr by some essential and unavoidable work, such as dressing wounds, and he is able to pray before the sun turns yellow but it is difficult, then he prays just before sunset. In this case he has prayed on time and has not sinned, because this is the time of necessity. If a person is forced to delay the prayer, there is no sin so long as he prays before the sun sets. 
3 – The time of Maghrib 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The time for Maghrib lasts until the twilight has faded”, i.e., the time for Maghrib starts immediately after the time for ‘Asr ends, which is when the sun sets, until the twilight or red afterglow has faded. When the red afterglow has disappeared from the sky, the time for Maghrib ends and the time for ‘Isha’ begins. Defining this time by the clock varies according to the season. When you see that the red afterglow has disappeared from the horizon, this is a sign that the time for Maghrib has ended. 
4 – The time of ‘Isha 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The time for ‘Isha’ lasts until midnight.”  
So the time for ‘Isha’ begins immediately after the time for Maghrib ends (i.e., when the red afterglow disappears from the sky) until midnight. 
How do we calculate when midnight is? 
If you want to calculate when midnight is, then calculate the time between sunset and the break of true dawn (when Fajr begins) then divide it in half; that halfway point is the end of the time for praying ‘Isha’ (and that is midnight). 
So if the sun sets at 5 p.m., and Fajr begins at 5 a.m., then midnight is 11 p.m. If the sun sets at 5 p.m. and Fajr begins at 6 a.m., then midnight is 11.30 p.m., and so on. 
5 – The time of Fajr 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The time for Subh (Fajr) prayer lasts from the beginning of the pre-dawn so long as the sun has not yet started to rise. When the sun starts to rise then stop praying, for it rises between the two horns of the Shaytan.” 
The time for Fajr begins with the onset of the “second dawn” (al-fajr al-thani) and ends when the sun starts to rise. The “second dawn” is the brightness that appears along the horizon in the east and extends north to south. The “first dawn” (al-fajr al-awwal) occurs approximately one hour before this, and there are differences between the two: 

In the “first dawn” the brightness extends from east to west, and in the “second dawn” it extends from north to south.
The “first dawn” is followed by darkness, i.e., the brightness lasts for a short period then it becomes dark. The “second dawn” is not followed by darkness, rather the light increases.
The “second dawn” is connected to the horizon, with no darkness between it and the horizon, whereas the “first dawn” is separated from the horizon with darkness between it and the horizon. See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 2/107.

Allaah 
          has made an exception in the case of women from among the People of

“(Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women

As 
          the wife mentioned in the question is not from among the People of the 
          Book, her Muslim husband has to fear Allaah and leave her, because his 
          relationship with her is haraam according to sharee’ah, and persisting 
          in it is zinaa and is haraam. If a woman becomes Muslim and her husband 
          is a kaafir, whether he is from among the People of the Book or not, 
          the marriage contract immediately becomes null and void, because of 
          the evidence cited above. She becomes forbidden to him by virtue of 
          her becoming Muslim, and she is no longer permissible for him, unless

          to indicate that it is prescribed to recite any soorah of the Qur’aan 
          in any place, or in the house of the deceased. We do not know of anyone 
          among the Sahaabah or Taabi’een or Taabi’ee al-Taabi’een [i.e., the 
          first three generations of Islam] from whom it is reported that he did 
          that. The basic principle is that this is not allowed, because the Prophet 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) said: “Whoever does any action that is not in accordance 
          with this matter of ours [i.e., Islam], will have it rejected.” (Narrated 
          by Muslim, al-Aqdiyah, 3243). With regard to gathering and making 
          du’aa’ for him, du’aa’ is an act of worship, and acts of worship are 
          based on the principle of tawqeef [i.e., to be based solely on the saheeh 
          texts, with no room for adding or taking away anything]. It is not reported 
          that the Prophet  (peace and blessings

          over its occupant and say, “Pray for forgiveness for your brother, for 
          he is being questioned now.” From the above we know that the correct 
          thing is not to offer a collective du’aa’ after offering the funeral

          are answered, such as the last third of the night, the last hour of 
          ‘Asr, Fridays, between the adhaan and ‘iqaamah, etc. You should be sincere 
          in your du’aa’. When the du’aa’ is only between you and Allaah, you 
          will feel more khushoo’ and will feel more sincere than when 
          you make du’aa’ simply to please others, as when people recite du’aa’

Did the Prophet trim his beard?


Islam is the religion of beauty


Unwanted beautification","Praise be to Allah.Is it haram to trim the beard?
The Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) indicates that it is obligatory to let the beard grow and that it is haram to shave it or cut it . 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Cut the moustache and let the beard grow; be different from the unbelievers.” (al-Bukhari, al-Libas, 5442; Muslim, al-Taharah, 382) 
There are many hadiths which say the same as this hadith, indicating that it is obligatory to leave the beard alone and let it grow and that it is haram to shave it or cut it .
Whoever claims that letting the beard grow is no more than a Sunnah for which a person may be rewarded and the one who does not do it will not be punished is going against the sound hadiths. 
Did the Prophet trim his beard?
The report that says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to trim the length and breadth of his beard is a false hadith.
Islam is the religion of beauty
But it should be noted that Islam is the religion of beauty, as it was narrated in the hadith, “[A man said,] ‘What if a man likes his clothes and his shoes to look good?’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘Allah is Beautiful and loves beauty.’” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Iman, 131)
 The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded [one of his Companions] to change gray hair , when he said, “Change this gray hair, but avoid black.” (Narrated by Muslim, Kitab al-Libas wa’l-Zinah, 2102)
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recommended combing hair, and said, “Whoever has hair, let him take care of it.” (Abu Dawud, Kitab al-Tarajjul, 3632. Al-Albani said in Sahih Sunan Abi Dawud: it is hasan sahih. Hadith no. 3509)
Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said: “Ibn Battal said: combing means tidying the hair of the head and beard, and oiling it.” This is the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Whoever turns away from my Sunnah has nothing to do with me.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, al-Nikah, 4675) 
Unwanted beautification 
The beauty referred to is shar’i or Islamic beauty (beauty as prescribed in Islam), and not the so-called beauty which appeals to sick minds which are enamoured of non-Muslim fashions and the appearance of corrupt people such as male and female actors and singers, or fashion models. 
Hence when some people were misled by those immoral western women who pluck or shave or draw their eyebrows , or make their nails long, or have tattoos, and thought that this is beauty, many Muslim women imitated them in these things, even though they are forbidden by shari’ah. 
The point is not what is fashionable in the east or the west, the point is the shari’ah which advocates wearing perfume (for men), keeping clean, dressing nicely, combing the hair, changing gray hair, and other kinds of beautification which are prescribed in Islam.

He has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success” [al-Tawbah 9:100]

Adhere to it and bite onto it with your eyeteeth (i.e. cling firmly to it). Beware of newly-invented matters, for every newly-invented matter is an innovation and every innovation is a going-astray.” And it was reported in a saheeh hadeeth that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in a Friday khutbah: “The best of speech is the Book of Allah and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The most evil of things are those which are newly-invented, and every innovation is a going-astray.” And there are many similar ahaadeeth. 
According to the saheeh ahaadeeth, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained the things that will benefit the Muslim after he dies. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When a man dies, all his good deeds come to a halt, apart from three: ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyah); beneficial knowledge; or a righteous child who will pray for him.” (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh). A man asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “O Messenger of Allah, is there anything that I can do to continue honouring my parents after they die?” He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Yes: pray for them, ask for forgiveness for them, fulfil their last wishes (wasiyah or will), honour their friends and uphold the ties of kinship which you would not have were it not for them.” The last wishes (wasiyah or will) expressed by the person before he or she died should be fulfilled so long as they are in accordance with sharee’ah. Other ways of honouring one’s parents is to give in charity on their behalf, to make du’aa’ for them and to perform Hajj and ‘Umrah on their behalf.
