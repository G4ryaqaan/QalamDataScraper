52901,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/52901,Ruling on defending the honour of the kuffaar,What is the ruling on defending the honour of the kuffaar? One day I slandered the honour of a kaafir and one of the Muslims responded and defended the honour of this kaafir. What is the ruling on defending their honour?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
It is not the attitude of a Muslim to insult others, slander them and impugn their honour. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The believer is not given to cursing, slandering or obscene and foul speech.” Narrated by Ahmad, 3948; al-Tirmidhi, 1977; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told people not to insult a Jew who deserved to be insulted, and he said that the reason for that is that Allaah does not like obscene talk. 
Al-Bukhaari (6401) narrated from ‘Aa’ishah that the Jews came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: “Al-saam ‘alayk (death be upon you). He said: “Wa ‘alaykum (and also upon you).” ‘Aa’ishah said: “Death be upon you, may Allaah send His curse and wrath upon you.” The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Take it easy, O ‘Aa’ishah! You should be kind and gentle, and beware of harshness and foul speech.” She said: “Did you not hear what they said?” He said: “Did you not hear what I said? I responded to them, and my du’aa’ concerning them was answered, but their du’aa’ concerning me was not answered.” 
According to a report narrated by Muslim (2165), ‘Aa’ishah noticed what they said and insulted them, and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Enough, O ‘Aa’ishah, for Allaah does not like foul speech and foul language.” 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
It seems that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not want her tongue to become accustomed to foul speech so he denounced her for going to extremes in insulting them. 
End quote from Fath al-Baari, 11/43. 
Secondly: 
One of the following two scenarios most apply in the case of a kaafir: 
Either he is in a state of war against the Muslims, in which case he has no sanctity (i.e., he is not protected); 
Or he has a peace treaty with the Muslims or is living under Muslim rule, in which case his life, honour and wealth are protected, and it is not permissible to transgress against him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned against transgressing against or wronging a kaafir whose rights are protected, as he said: “Whoever does wrong to a mu’aahad (a kaafir who has a peace treaty with the Muslims), or tries to put him down, or burdens him with more than he can bear, or takes something from him without his consent, I will be his opponent on the Day of Resurrection.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 3052; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
End quote from ‘Awn al-Ma’bood. 
Al-San’aani said in Subul al-Salaam (2/663), concerning the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “Trading insults with a Muslim is evildoing”: 
It may be understood from the word “Muslim” here that it is permissible to insult a kaafir, but if he is a mu’aahad then it is an offence to him, and it is forbidden to offend him, so we should not follow what may be understood from this hadeeth in such a case. But if the kaafir is one who is at war with the Muslims, then it is permissible to insult him because he has no protection. End quote. 
It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (24/142): 
For a Muslim to slander or insult a dhimmi (a non-Muslim living under Muslim rule) is a sin, and a Muslim is to be punished if he insults a kaafir. Al-Shaafa’i said: It makes no difference if he is alive or he is dead and is known to have died in kufr. Al-Buhooti, one of the Hanbalis, said: The punishment is because transgressing the limits set by Allaah. End quote. 
It also says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (30/139): 
Those who are living under a peace treaty or covenant with the Muslims are entitled to be safe with regard to their lives, their wealth and their honour. The ruler should protect them from everyone among the Muslims and others who wishes to harm them, and they should not be wronged so long as the covenant between them and the Muslims is in effect. End quote. 
If the slander was an accusation of zina (adultery, fornication), then that makes matters even worse. The scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) have stated that the one who does that is to be punished. 
See al-Mughni. 9/48; al-Furoo’, 6/108; al-Insaaf, 10/203; Nasab al-Raayah, 4/174. 
The point is that whoever defends the honour of a kaafir, by refuting what is said about him wrongfully, is doing no wrong, in fact he is doing the right thing. It is not the way of a Muslim to slander people’s honour. If he also tells him to stop slandering and insulting others, he is doing good and will be rewarded in sha Allaah.

52903,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/52903,Copying tapes and CDs with the aim of distributing them,"We copy religious tapes and give them away for free or sell them very cheaply in order to distribute them more widely, but the tapes are protected by copyright, and our aim is to spread knowledge and da’wah.

 Similarly with CDs, it may be difficult and expensive to get hold of original copies. And the purpose of what we do is to spread knowledge.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Copyright or the rights of authors, inventors and 
      producers, and other financial and moral rights, belong to the owners of 
      these works and it is not permissible to transgress against them or 
      undermine them without the permission of their owners. That includes 
      tapes, CDs and books. 

    Reference may be made concerning that to what was written by 
    Shaykh Bakr ibn ‘Abd-Allaah Abu Zayd (may Allaah preserve him) about 
    copyright in his book Fiqh al-Nawaazil, 2/101-187. 

    The Standing Committee was asked: Is it permissible for me to 
    record (a copy of) a tape and sell it without asking permission from its 
    author, or from the publisher if the author is no longer alive? Is it 
    permissible to make many copies of a book and sell them? Is it permissible 
    to make a copy of a book and not sell it, rather keep it for myself, if it 
    is marked copyright; do I have to ask for permission or not? 

    They replied: There is nothing wrong with making copies of 
    useful tapes and selling them, or making copies of books and selling them, 
    because that is helping to spread knowledge, unless their authors have 
    stated that this is not allowed, in which case their permission must be 
    sought. 

    End quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 13/187 

    The Committee was also asked: I work in the field of 
    computers, and since I started working I have been making copies of programs 
    to work with them. I have been doing that without purchasing an original 
    copy of these programs, knowing that these programs carry warnings against 
    making copies and their copyright is protected, like the phrase “all rights 
    reserved” which appears on some books. The author of the program may be a 
    Muslim or a kaafir. My question is: is it permissible to make copies in this 
    manner or not? 

    They replied: It is not permissible to make copies of 
    programs whose authors have forbidden the making of copies without their 
    permission, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “The Muslims are bound by their conditions.” And he  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever reaches a persmittible 
    thing first has more right to it.” It does not matter whether the author of 
    the program is a Muslim or a kaafir who is not in a state of war with Islam, 
    because the rights of a kaafir who is not in a state of war with Islam are 
    to be respected like the rights of a Muslim. 

    End quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 13/188. 

    There is also a statement from the Islamic Fiqh Council 
    concerning intellectual property rights in which it says: 

    Firstly:

    Trade names, trademarks, copyright and patents are all rights 
    which belong exclusively to their owners. In modern times they have come to 
    have a considerable financial value. These rights are recognized according 
    to sharee’ah, and they should not be violated. 

    … 

    Thirdly:

    Copyright and patents are protected by sharee’ah. Their 
    owners have the right to buy or sell them and nobody has the right to 
    violate these rights.  

    Undoubtedly the authors of these tapes and CDs have expended 
    time, effort and money to produce them, and there is nothing in sharee’ah to 
    indicate that they should not take the profits that result from this work. 
    The one who transgresses against their rights is wronging them and consuming 
    their wealth unlawfully. 

    If it is permissible to transgress against these rights, then 
    these companies would stop producing these things, because it beings no 
    returns. Their employees would have no motive to work, and undoubtedly 
    stopping this work would result in a great deal of good being withheld from 
    people. So it is appropriate that the scholars have stated that it is haraam 
    to transgress against these rights. 

    This is the basic ruling, but in some cases it may be 
    permissible to make copies without the author’s permission. That applies in 
    two cases: 

    1 – If something is not available in the marketplace, if 
    there is a need for it and it is charitable distribution, not for sale or 
    for making a profit. 

    2 – If there is a great need for it and its authors are 
    asking for more than its price, and they have already made enough money to 
    cover the cost of producing this program with a reasonable profit – which is 
    to be decided by people of experience. In that case, if it serves the 
    interests of the Muslims, it is permissible to copy it, so as to ward off 
    harm. But that is subject to the condition that it not be sold for personal 
    gain. 

    And Allaah is the Source of strength. 

    You can contact the companies which produced the material and 
    tell them of the charitable purpose behind it and ask them for permission to 
    make copies, or give them an appropriate price.

52906,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/52906,Are Two People Enough to Pray in Congregation?,"If there are two men in a household, is this enough to pray a congregational prayer together, i.e. one Imam and one follower?","Two people are enough to pray in congregation, whether that is in the house or elsewhere. However, men are required to offer the prayers in congregation in the mosque. It is not permissible to offer the obligatory prayers at home, whether in congregation or alone, unless one has an excuse.",,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, two people are enough to pray in congregation , whether that is in the house or elsewhere. Imam Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Chapter: Two or more form a congregation.” Then he narrated the Hadith of Malik ibn Al-Huwayrith (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When the time for prayer comes, give the Adhan and Iqamah then let the oldest of you two lead you in prayer.” (Al-Bukhaari, 658)
Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Chapter: Two or more form a congregation”: this heading was narrated in a Hadith which was narrated via various inauthentic Isnads (chains of narrators), which said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw a man praying by himself and said: “Will not a man perform an act of charity for him and pray with him?” So a man stood up and prayed with him, and he said: “These two are a congregation.” 
The story mentioned – apart from the words, “These two are a congregation” – was narrated by Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi with a different authentic Isnad. 
He (may Allah have mercy on him) also said: 
“This (the Hadith of Malik ibn Al-Huwayrith (may Allah be pleased with him)) may be understood as meaning that the smallest a congregation can be is an Imam and one follower, which is more general in meaning than saying that the follower may be a man or a boy or a woman.
The Hadith referred to by Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) is narrated by Abu Dawud (554) who classed it as authentic. The report is as follows: It was narrated from Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw a man praying on his own and said: “Why doesn’t a man perform an act of charity for him and pray with him?” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami`, 2652) 
It says in `Awn Al-Ma`bud: “… so that he may attain the reward of praying in congregation, so it will be as if he gave him charity.” 
It was narrated from Ubayy ibn Ka`b (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “… for a man to pray with another man is better than his praying alone, and for a man to pray with two other men is better than his praying with one man. The more there are, the more beloved that is to Allah.” (An-Nasa’i, 843; Abu Dawud, 554; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami`, 2242)
However, it should be noted that what is required of men is to offer the prayers in congregation in the mosque ; it is not permissible to offer the obligatory prayers at home , whether in congregation or alone, unless one has an excuse. 
The Standing Committee was asked: If two people pray together is that a congregation or not? 
They replied: 
“If two or more people pray together, that is a congregation, but the more people there are, the better; it should also be noted that prayers in congregation should be offered in the mosque .” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 7/289)
Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about some people who prayed in congregation at home. 
He said: 
“We advise them to fear Allah and to pray in congregation with the Muslims in the mosque, because the most correct scholarly view concerning this matter is that it is obligatory to offer prayers in congregation in the mosque, unless one has an excuse. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I thought of ordering that the Iqamah be given, then I would order a man to lead the people in prayer, and I would take some men carrying bundles of wood and go to people who did not attend the prayer, and burn their houses down on them.” (See Al-Bukhari, 644; Muslim, 651) 
Those people may be have been offering the prayers in congregation in their own places, but the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wanted them to pray with the congregation which was performing the prayer in the manner prescribed in Shari`ah, and the congregation which Shari`ah says one should pray with is those who pray in the mosques, the mosques to which they are called when the time for prayer comes. Hence `Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ‘Whoever would like to meet Allah tomorrow as a Muslim, let him offer these prayers regularly where the call for them is given.’” (Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 15/19)

52918,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/52918,Does he have to offer expiation for accidental killing if he struck them with his car and his wife died?,"I have a friend who was driving his car with his wife beside him. Suddenly another car struck them on the side where his wife was sitting, and she died instantly. Please note that he was not driving any faster than 50 kph, and that the cause of the accident was the other driver who hit them. Does my friend have to offer expiation for killing accidentally?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If your friend was not 
      at fault and did not cause the accident in any way, then he does not have 
      to do anything, either paying diyah (blood money) or offering expiation. 
      Expiation must be offered by the other driver who was at fault, and his 
      male relatives must pay the diyah (such as his father, his paternal 
      uncles, his brothers and his nephews). If they were both at fault, then 
      the diyah must be paid by both sets of male relatives (each according to 
      his proportion of blame), and each of them must offer expiation in full. 

    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in 
    al-Mughni (12/116): 

    Whoever is partly to blame for killing must offer expiation; 
    it must be offered by him and by everyone else who shares the blame with 
    him. This is the view of the majority of scholars, including al-Hasan, 
    ‘Ikrimah, al-Nakha’i, al-Thawri, Maalik, al-Shaafa’i, and the ashaab 
    al-ra’i. End quote. 

    There are three main reasons for the mistake that may have 
    happened in this case: 

    Either it happened because of carelessness in maintenance of 
    the car, such as the brakes etc.

    Or the problem may have been with the driver, such as if he 
    was driving the car when he needed to sleep, or was distracted by something 
    that kept him from focusing fully on driving

    Or it was the result of failing to obey the traffic rules. 

    Determining the mistake and who is at fault is something that 
    must be left to the experts in that field. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, in 
    his essay Ahkaam Hawaadith al-Sayaaraat (Rulings on auto accidents) 
    that if one of the passengers who got in the car with the driver by his own 
    free will is injured, then one of the following four scenarios must apply to 
    this accident: 

    -1-
It happened as the result 
    of aggressive action on the part of the driver, such as if he was going at a 
    speed which caused the accident, or he slammed on the brakes for no reason 
    and the accident happened as a result. 

    -2-

    It happened as the result of negligence on the part of the 
    driver. The difference is that aggressive action means doing something that 
    is not justified, whereas negligence means failing to do something that is 
    required, such as failing to close doors properly, or to fill the tires 
    properly with air, or to fix something that needs fixing, and the accident 
    happened as the result of that negligence. 

    In these two cases, expiation must be offered by the driver. 
    The expiation is freeing a slave for each human life protected by sharee’ah 
    that was lost; if he cannot do that then he must fast for two consecutive 
    months and not break the fast except for a legitimate shar’i excuse such as 
    travelling, sickness and the like. Compensation for any property damaged or 
    destroyed and diyah for the lives lost must also be paid by his male kin. 

    -3-

    It happened as the result of the driver swerving to avoid 
    danger, such as if something was coming towards him which he feared might 
    hit him, or if someone pulled out from the right or the left in such a way 
    that he could not stop, so he swerved to avoid that danger, and the accident 
    happened. 

    -4- 

    If happened as the result of no cause on his part, such as if 
    one of his tires blew or a bridge collapsed beneath him and he could not 
    tell that there was something wrong with it. 

    In these two cases, he does not have to offer any expiation 
    or pay any compensation, because in the first case he was doing what he is 
    required to do of trying to avoid danger, so he was doing the right thing, 
    and no ground (of complaint) can there be against those who do good (cf. 
    al-Tawbah 9:91).  

    In the second case he was doing the right thing and did not 
    commit any act of aggression or negligence, so he does not have to do 
    anything, because he did not cause the accident. End quote. 

    This essay was published in the official journal of the Imam 
    Muhammad ibn Sa’ood Islamic University, 12 Sha’baan 1409 AH 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked 
    concerning a man whose car rolled over and his wife died: does he have to 
    offer any expiation or not? 

    He replied: 

    If you were not negligent in your driving or in taking care 
    of your car, and the accident happened when the state of your car, your 
    driving and your health were all normal, then you do not have to do anything 
    because there is no proof that you caused the accident. But if it is proven 
    that you fell short with regard to what is mentioned above, then you have to 
    offer expiation, by freeing a believing slave; if you cannot do that, then 
    you must fast for two consecutive months, because Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is not for a 
    believer to kill a believer except (that it be) by mistake; and whosoever 
    kills a believer by mistake, (it is ordained that) he must set free a 
    believing slave and a compensation (blood money, i.e. Diya) be given to the 
    deceased’s family unless they remit it. If the deceased belonged to a people 
    at war with you and he was a believer, the freeing of a believing slave (is 
    prescribed); and if he belonged to a people with whom you have a treaty of 
    mutual alliance, compensation (blood money — Diya) must be paid to his 
    family, and a believing slave must be freed. And whoso finds this (the 
    penance of freeing a slave) beyond his means, he must fast for two 
    consecutive months in order to seek repentance from Allaah. And Allaah is 
    Ever All‑Knowing, All‑Wise”

52923,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/52923,Is the person who prays Friday prayer only not a kaafir?,"Is it correct that who prays Friday prayer only is not considered kaafir? I read that sheikh Ben Uthaimeen, may Allah have mercy on him, said: whoever prays Friday prayer is not a kaafir; because he never neglects it, because the prophet, peace be upon him, said (the prayer) not (prayer). Is it true that ibn Uthaimeen and ibn Taymiyah said this?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is a difference of opinion among those who say that the one who does not pray is a kaafir, with regard to the exact definition of the omission of prayer which makes him a kaafir. Most of them are of the view that he becomes a kaafir if he omits one obligatory prayer or two obligatory prayers. 
Some of them are of the view that the one who does not pray does not become a kaafir unless he gives up prayer altogether. 
The former opinion was narrated by Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh (may Allah have mercy on him) from the Sahaabah and Taabi’een. Imam Muhammad ibn Nasr al-Maroozi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: I heard Ishaaq say: it is narrated in a saheeh report from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that the one who does not pray is a kaafir, and this was the opinion of the scholars from the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) until our own time, that the one who deliberately does not pray without any excuse until the time for the prayer is over is a kaafir. 
The ending of the time means delaying Zuhr until sunset and delaying Maghrib until the sun rises. 
The end of the times for prayer was set as described above because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) joined prayers at ‘Arafah and Muzdalifah and when travelling, so he prayed one of them at the time of the other. Because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) offered the first prayer at the time of the second in some cases, and the second prayer at the time of the first in other cases, the time for both became one time in cases where one has an excuse, just as the menstruating woman, if she becomes pure before sunset, is commanded to pray both Zuhr and ‘Asr, and if she becomes pure at the end of the night, she is commanded to pray both Maghrib and ‘Isha’. End quote from Ta’zeem Qadr al-Salaah (2/929). 
 Muhammad ibn Nasr (Allah have mercy on him) narrated that Imam Ahmad said: No one becomes a kaafir because of sin except the one who deliberately does not pray. If he does not pray until the time for the next prayer begins, he must be asked to repent three times. End quote. 
It was narrated that Ibn al-Mubaarak said: Whoever deliberately does not pray with no excuse until the time is over, is a kaafir. Ta’zeem Qadr al-Salaah (2/297). 
Ibn Hazm said:
We narrated from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (me Allah be pleased with him), Mu’aadh ibn Jabal, Ibn Mas’ood  and a number of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them), and from Ibn al-Mubaarak, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh (may Allah have mercy on them), and from 17 of the Sahaabah in total (may Allah be pleased with them) that the one who deliberately and consciously does not offer an obligatory prayer until the time for it ends is a kaafir and an apostate. This is also the view of ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Maajishoon, the companion of Maalik. And it was the view of ‘Abd al-Malik ibn Habeeb al-Andalusi and others. End quote from al-Fasl fi’l-Milal wa’l-Ahwa’ wa’l-Nihal, 3/128. 
He (may Allah have mercy on him) said: And it was narrated from ‘Umar, ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Awf, Mu’aadh ibn Jabal, Abu Hurayrah and others among the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) that the one who deliberately does not offer one obligatory prayer until the time for it ends is a kaafir and an apostate. End quote from al-Muhalla (2/15). 
This view was also expressed in fatwas by the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas, led by Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him). 
Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (6/50, 40) 
Some of the scholars quoted as evidence for this opinion the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Whoever does not pray ‘Asr, all his good deeds are cancelled out.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (528), because cancellation of good deeds can only happen as a result of becoming a kaafir, and because of what has been quoted above from the Sahaabah who narrated these hadeeths. 
With regard to the second opinion, which is that the one who does not pray does not become a kaafir unless he gives up prayer altogether, this is the view of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), although he also ruled to be a kaafir the one who misses some prayers and is called by the ruler to pray but does not pray. He also stated that the one who prays sometimes and does not pray sometimes, if he resolves in his heart to give up prayer altogether, then he is inwardly a kaafir, i.e., it is between him and Allah, may He be exalted. 
See: Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 22/49, 7/715; Sharh al-‘Umdah, 2/94. 
This was also the view of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: What appears to be the case from the evidence is that he does not become a kaafir unless he gives up prayer all the time, in the sense that he has decided not to pray, so he does not pray Zuhr, ‘Asr, Maghrib, ‘Isha’ or Fajr. This is the one who is a kaafir. But if he prays one or two obligatory prayers, then he is not a kaafir and he cannot truly be described as having given up prayer. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Between a man and shirk and kufr stands his giving up prayer (al-salaah)” and he did not say “salaah (a prayer)”. End quote from al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (2/26). 
We could not find any written comment of his concerning one who only offers Friday prayer, but we asked him about that verbally and he replied that it seems that he does become a kaafir because Friday prayer is one of 35 prayers in the week, so the one who only prays Friday prayer can be described as giving up prayer altogether so he could become a kaafir as a result.
