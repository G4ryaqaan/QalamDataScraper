13202,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13202,It is not permissible for a master to have intercourse with his married slave woman,Is a man permitted to have sexual intercourse with a slave woman who is married?,,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          It is not permissible for a man to have intercourse with his slave woman 
          who is married; whoever does that has committed a haraam (forbidden) 
          action and is to be punished. 
Ibn Qudaamah 
          said in al-Mughni: if he marries off his slave woman, then it 
          is forbidden for him to have intercourse with her… There is no doubt 
          and no dispute concerning the prohibition on his having intercourse 
          with her, for she is now permissible to her husband, and no woman can 
          be permissible to two men. If he has intercourse with her then he is 
          guilty of sin and must be punished. Ahmad said, he should be flogged 
          but not stoned, i.e., his punishment (ta’zeer) should take the form 
          of flogging.

13205,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13205,This world is the place of trials and tribulations,What is this world?,,,"Praise be to Allah.This world is the place of striving and the Hereafter is the place of reward or punishment, where the believers will be rewarded with Paradise and the disbelievers will be punished with Hell. 
Paradise is good and none but those who were good will enter it. Allah is Good and accepts nothing but that which is good. So the way of Allah with His slaves is to test them with calamities and tribulations, so that the believer may be known from the kaafir and so that the truthful may be distinguished from the liar, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: ‘We believe,’ and will not be tested.
And We indeed tested those who were before them. And Allah will certainly make (it) known (the truth of) those who are true, and will certainly make (it) known (the falsehood of) those who are liars, (although Allah knows all that before putting them to test)” [al-‘Ankaboot 29:2-3] 
Victory and success cannot be achieved except after tests which will bring the good forth from the evil and tell the believer apart from the kaafir, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah will not leave the believers in the state in which you are now, until He distinguishes the wicked from the good. Nor will Allah disclose to you the secrets of the Ghayb (Unseen)” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:179] 
Among the trials with which Allah tests His slaves in order to distinguish the believers from the disbelievers is that which He mentions in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to As-Saabiroon (the patient).
Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: ‘Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.’
They are those on whom are the Salawaat (i.e. who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones” [al-Baqarah 2:155-157] 
So Allah tests His slaves, and He loves those who are patient, and gives them the glad tidings of Paradise. 
Allah tests His slaves with jihaad, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Do you think that you will enter Paradise before Allah tests those of you who fought (in His Cause) and (also) tests those who are As-Saabiroon (the patient)?” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:142] 
Wealth and children are a trial by means of which Allah tests His slaves, to know who will give thanks for them, and who will be distracted from Allah by them: 
“And know that your possessions and your children are but a trial and that surely, with Allah is a mighty reward”
[al-Anfaal 8:28 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Allah tests us, sometimes with calamities and sometimes with blessings, to show who will be thankful and who will be ungrateful, and who will obey and who will disobey, then He will reward or punish them on the Day of Resurrection: 
“and We shall make a trial of you with evil and with good. And to Us you will be returned”
[al-Anbiya’ 21:35 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Testing is according to one’s faith; the most severely tested among mankind are the Prophets, then the next best and the next best. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When I fall ill, my pain is equivalent to the pain of two men among you.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5648). 
Allah tests His slaves with different kinds of trials. 
Sometimes He tests them with calamities and tribulations to distinguish the believer from the disbeliever, the obedient from the disobedient, the grateful from the ungrateful. 
Sometimes Allah tests His slaves with calamities; when they commit sin, He punishes them with calamities so that they might come back to him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much” [al-Shoora 42:30] 
“And indeed We seized them with punishment, but they humbled not themselves to their Lord, nor did they invoke (Allah) with submission to Him” [al-Mu’minoon 23:76] 
Allah is merciful to His slaves; He sends repeated tribulations upon the ummah so that they may return and repent to Him, and give up that which Allah has forbidden, and so that Allah might forgive them. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“See they not that they are put in trial once or twice every year (with different kinds of calamities, disease, famine)? Yet, they turn not in repentance, nor do they learn a lesson (from it)” [al-Tawbah 9:126] 
It is part of the mercy of Allah that disasters befall sinners in this world, so that their souls might be purified and they might come back to Allah before they die: 
“And verily, We will make them taste of the near torment (i.e. the torment in the life of this world, i.e. disasters, calamities) prior to the supreme torment (in the Hereafter), in order that they may (repent and) return (i.e. accept Islam)”
[al-Sajdah 32:21 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Sometimes Allah tests His slaves with calamities in order to raise them in status and to expiate for their sins, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No misfortune or disease befalls a Muslim, no worry or grief or harm or distress – not even a thorn that pricks him – but Allah will expiate for some of his sins because of that.” (Agreed upon. Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5641)","From Usool al-Deen al-Islami, by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem al-Tuwayjri"
13206,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13206,Hadeeth,Why are the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) counted as proof?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Hadeeth means the 
    words, actions, approvals or attributes that have been narrated from the 
    Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).  

    A hadeeth may 
    either confirm things that are mentioned in the Quran, such as prayer, zakah 
    (poor-due), etc., or it may give details of things that are mentioned in the 
    Quran in general terms, such as the numbers of rak’ahs (units) in each 
    prayer, the thresholds for paying zakah, the details of Hajj, etc. It may 
    also explain rulings which are not mentioned in the Quran, such as the 
    prohibition on being married to a woman and her (paternal or maternal) aunt 
    at the same time.  

    Allah revealed the 
    Quran to His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) 
    and commanded him to explain it to the people, as He said (interpretation of 
    the meaning):  

    “And We have also 
    sent down unto you (O Muhammad) the Dhikr [reminder and the advice (i.e. the 
    Quran)], that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them, and 
    that they may give thought.” 

    [al-Nahl 16:44] 
    

    The hadeeth of the 
    Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is a revelation (wahy) 
    from his Lord. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
    

    “Your companion 
    (Muhammad) has neither gone astray nor has erred. 

    Nor does he speak 
    of (his own) desire. 

    It is only a 
    Revelation revealed.” 

    [al-Najm 53:2-4] 
    

    Allah sent His 
    Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to call 
    mankind to worship Allah alone, and to disbelieve in any (god) apart from 
    Him, and (He sent him) to bring the glad tidings of Paradise and warnings of 
    Hell:  

    “O Prophet 
    (Muhammad)! Verily, We have sent you as witness, and a bearer of glad 
    tidings, and a warner, 

    And as one who 
    invites to Allah [Islamic Monotheism, i.e. to worship none but Allah 
    (Alone)] by His leave, and as a lamp spreading light (through your 
    instructions from the Quran and the Sunnah/the legal ways of the Prophet).
    

    [al-Ahzab 33:45-46 
    – interpretation of the meaning]  

    The Messenger 
    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was anxious over this ummah; he 
    did not know of anything good but he told them of it, and he did not know of 
    anything evil but he warned them against it:  

    “Verily, there has 
    come unto you a Messenger (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him 
    that you should receive any injury or difficulty. He (Muhammad) is anxious 
    over you; for the believers (he is) full of pity, kind, and merciful.”
    

    [al-Tawbah 9:128 – 
    interpretation of the meaning]  

    Every Prophet was 
    sent only to his own people, but Allah sent His Messenger Muhammad (peace 
    and blessings of Allah be upon him) to all of mankind:  

    “And We have sent 
    you (O Muhammad) not but as a mercy for the ‘Alameen (mankind, jinn and all 
    that exists).” 

    [al-Anbiya 21:101 
    – interpretation of the meaning]  

    Because the 
    Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) conveyed the revelation 
    that was sent down to him from His Lord, it is obligatory to obey him. 
    Indeed, obedience to him is obedience to Allah:  

    “He who obeys the 
    Messenger (Muhammad), has indeed obeyed Allah.” 

    [al-Nisa 4:80 – 
    interpretation of the meaning]  

    Obedience to Allah 
    and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the way to 
    salvation and victory, and to happiness in this world and in the Hereafter: 
    

    “And whosoever 
    obeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed achieved a great achievement 
    (i.e. he will be saved from the Hellfire and will be admitted to Paradise).”
    

    [al-Ahzab 33:71 – 
    interpretation of the meaning]  

    Hence it is 
    obligatory for all people to obey Allah and His Messenger (peace and 
    blessings of Allah be upon him), because therein lies their success and 
    salvation:  

    “And obey Allah 
    and the Messenger (Muhammad) that you may obtain mercy.” 

    [Al ‘Imran 3:132 – 
    interpretation of the meaning]  

    Whoever disobeys 
    Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) only 
    harms himself, he does not harm Allah in the slightest:  

    “And whosoever 
    disobeys Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad), and transgresses His limits, He 
    will cast him into the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall have a 
    disgraceful torment.” 

    [al-Nisa 4:14 – 
    interpretation of the meaning]  

    Once Allah and His 
    Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) have decided a matter, 
    no one has the right to choose concerning it or to object to it; rather it 
    is obligatory to obey and to believe in the truth:  

    “It is not for a 
    believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter 
    that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys 
    Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed into a plain error. 
    

    [al-Ahzab 33:36 – 
    interpretation of the meaning]  

    A person's faith 
    is not complete until he loves Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings 
    of Allah be upon him), and love implies obedience. Whoever wants Allah to 
    love him and forgive his sins must follow the Messenger (peace and blessings 
    of Allah be upon him):  

    “Say (O Muhammad 
    to mankind): ‘If you (really) love Allah, then follow me (i.e. accept 
    Islamic Monotheism, follow the Quran and the Sunnah), Allah will love you 
    and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.’”
    

    [Al ‘Imran 3:31 – 
    interpretation of the meaning]  

    Love of the 
    Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is not simply the 
    matter of words to be repeated, rather it is the matter of belief and 
    conduct, i.e., obedience to what he commands, belief in what he tells us, 
    avoidance of what he forbids, and avoidance of worshipping Allah in any way 
    except that which he prescribed.  

    When Allah had 
    perfected this religion and the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be 
    upon him) had conveyed the message of his Lord, Allah took him to be with 
    Him. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) left this 
    ummah (his followers) with clear proof in which there is no ambiguity. No 
    one deviates from it but he is doomed:  

    “This day, those 
    who disbelieved have given up all hope of your religion; so fear them not, 
    but fear Me. This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My 
    favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.” 
    

    [al-Maidah 5:3 – 
    interpretation of the meaning]  

    By the grace of 
    Allah, the Sahabah/Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) preserved the 
    ahaadeeth (prophetic teachings) of the Messenger (peace and blessings of 
    Allah be upon them), then the righteous salaf (pious predecessors) who came 
    after them compiled them in books which are known as the Sihah 
    (Saheehs/authentic collections), Sunan and Musnads. The most sound of them 
    are Saheeh al-Bukhari, Saheeh Muslim, the four Sunans, the Musnad of al-Imam 
    Ahmad and the Muwatta of al-Imam Malik, etc.  

    Allah has 
    perfected this religion. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon 
    him) did not know of anything good but he taught it to his ummah, and he did 
    not know of anything evil but he warned them against it. So whoever 
    introduces anything into the religion,  of bid’ah (innovation) or myths, 
    such as praying to the dead or circumambulating (tawaf) their tombs, or 
    praying to the jinn and awliya (“saints”), and other things that have not 
    been prescribed by Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be 
    upon him), all of this is to be rejected and not accepted, as the Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever innovates 
    something in this matter of ours (Islam) that is not a part of it will have 
    it rejected.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1718) .",From Usool al-Deen al-Islami by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem al-Tuwayjri

    It is not permissible for a Muslim to imitate the kuffaar in 
    his dress. If wearing these caps or anything else is one of their 
    distinguishing features and something for which they are well are known and 
    by which they are distinguished from others, then it is not permissible for 
    the Muslim to wear those things. But if it serves some purpose and it is not 
    something that belongs exclusively to the kuffaar, such as hats worn for 
    work on building sites or in other workplaces, which are worn to protect the 
    head and shade the eyes from the sun, there is nothing wrong with doing 
    that. But if the hat is worn with the visor to the side or the back, this is 
    not appropriate for the Muslim youth.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Please advise us.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, everything of sickness, difficulty, worry or distress that befalls a person, even the prick of a thorn, is an expiation for his sins. Then if he bears it patiently and seeks reward for that with Allah, as well as the expiation of his sins he will be rewarded for the patience with which he bears the calamity that has befallen him. It makes no difference whether that is at the time of death or before. Calamities are expiation of sin for the believer. The proof of that is the verse (interpretation of the meaning):
“And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much” [Al-Shoora 42:30]
 Since that is because of what our hands have earned, this indicates that it is an expiation for the things we have done. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that no worry, distress or hurt befalls the Muslim, not even a thorn that pricks him, but Allah will expiate his sins thereby.","Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymen, in al-Fatawa al-Jaami’ah li’l-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, part 3, p. 1138"
13211,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13211,Muslim woman’s hijaab in front of kaafir women,"What are the things that a Muslim woman may uncover in front of a kaafir woman, such as a Buddhist woman for example? Is it true that she is not allowed to uncover her face?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The correct view is that a woman may uncover what is above 
    the navel and what is below the knees in front of another woman, whether she 
    is a Muslim or a kaafir. As for the area between the navel and the knees, 
    this is ‘awrah and is to be covered in front of everyone. No woman should 
    see this area of another woman, whether she is Muslim or non-Muslim, related 
    to her or not related; the same applies to the ‘awrah among men (i.e., no 
    man should see the ‘awrah of another man). A woman may see the chest, head, 
    shins, etc., of another woman; similarly a man may see the chest, shins, and 
    head of another man. With regard to the view of some scholars, that a 
    believing woman should not uncover in front of a kaafir woman, this view is 
    superceded by the more correct of the two scholarly views, because at the 
    time of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), Jewish 
    women and also idol-worshipping women used to enter upon the wives of the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) for various 
    reasons; it is not narrated that they used to wear hijaab in front of them, 
    and they are the best and most pious of women.","Shaykh Ibn Baaz, in al-Fataawa al-Jaami’ah li’l-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, part 3, p. 830"
13213,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13213,Wearing leather coats,What is the ruling on coats made from pigskin?,,,"Praise be to Allah.It was proven that the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When 
    (animal) skin is tanned, it becomes pure.” And he said, “Tanning the skin of 
    a dead animal [i.e., one which has died of natural causes as opposed to 
    being slaughtered] purifies it.” The scholars differed concerning this – 
    does this hadeeth apply to all kinds of animal skins, or only the skins of 
    animals which become halaal when slaughtered according to sharee’ah?

     Undoubtedly it is permissible to use in any way the tanned 
    skins of dead animals which become halaal when slaughtered according to 
    sharee’ah, such as camels and cows, according to the most correct scholarly 
    opinion. With regard to the skins of pigs, dogs and the like, which cannot 
    be made halaal by slaughtering them in the manner prescribed in sharee’ah, 
    there is a difference of opinion among the scholars as to whether they can 
    be made pure by tanning. In order to be on the safe side, it is better not 
    to use them, heeding the words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him), “Whoever avoids doubtful matters, that will be better 
    for his religious commitment and his honour.” And he  (peace and

What is the ruling on keeping them after using them, since they are full of pictures of women?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Undoubtedly buying magazines in which there is nothing but 
    pictures is haraam, because keeping pictures is haraam. The Prophet

    house in which there are images.” And when he saw the images on the cushion 
    that ‘Aa’ishah had brought, he stopped and did not enter, and she saw signs 
    of displeasure on his face. These magazines which show pictures of fashion 
    should not be looked at. Not every kind of dress is permissible; because 
    some designs may show the ‘awrah either because they are too tight or for 
    some other reason. This fashion may be part of the dress of the kaafirs 
    which belongs exclusively to them, and imitating the kaafirs is haraam 
    because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” What I advise my Muslim brothers in general, and the Muslim women in particular, to do is to avoid these fashions, because some of them may involve imitating non-Muslims and some may involve showing the ‘awrah. Moreover, if women look to every new fashion, will lead to them abandoning our customs which are based on from our religion, and adopting other customs that have come from the non-Muslims.","Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen in al-Fataawa al-‘Jaami’ah li’l-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, part 3, p. 861"

It does not come under the heading of cosmetic procedures or adding to that which Allaah has created, or changing the creation of Allaah. Rather it is restoring something that is missing and correcting a fault.

And it was narrated in a saheeh hadeeth that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A person may be deprived of provision because of sins that he commits.” So each Muslim man and woman must beware of sin, and must repent from sins that they have committed in the past, whilst also thinking positively about Allaah, hoping for His forgiveness and fearing His wrath and punishment. Allaah says in His Holy Book about His righteous slaves: 
“Verily, they used to hasten on to do good deeds, and they used to call on Us with hope and fear, and used to humble themselves before Us”
[al-Anbiya’ 21:90 – interpretation of the meaning]
And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Those whom they call upon [like ‘Eesa (Jesus) - son of Maryam (Mary), ‘Uzayr (Ezra), angel and others] desire (for themselves) means of access to their Lord (Allaah), as to which of them should be the nearest; and they [‘Eesa (Jesus), ‘Uzayr (Ezra), angels and others] hope for His Mercy and fear His Torment. Verily, the Torment of your Lord is (something) to be afraid of!”
[al-Isra’ 17:57]
“The believers, men and women, are Awliyaa’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); they perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and give the Zakaah, and obey Allaah and His Messenger. Allaah will have His Mercy on them. Surely, Allaah is All-Mighty, All-Wise”
[al-Tawbah 9:71]
It is prescribed, however, for Muslim men and women also to pursue the means that Allaah has permitted, placing their hope in Him and fearing Him, pursuing the means whilst also putting their trust in Allaah and depending on Him to bring what they hope for and keep them safe from what they fear, for He is the Ever-Responsive and Most Generous who says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).
 
And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine”
[al-Talaaq 65:2-3] 
“and whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make his matter easy for him”
[al-Talaaq 65:4] 
“And all of you beg Allaah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful”[al-Noor 24:31]
So you must repent to Allaah from whatever sins you have committed in the past and be steadfast in obeying Allaah, whilst thinking positively of Him and fearing His wrath.

          He (al-Khirqi) said: if he is mute, then he may point

          Ibn al-Mundhir said: all of the scholars from whom we

          is halaal. (Those scholars) include al-Layth, al-Shaafa’i, Ishaaq and

          Since this is proven, then he should point towards the 
          sky, because this gesture will take the place of speaking. His pointing 
          towards the sky indicates that he intends to mention the One Who is 
          above the heavens. 
 
          Al-Shu’bi said something similar to this. 
 
          This is also indicated by the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah, 
          that “A man brought a non-Arab slave woman to the Messenger of Allaah

          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Set her free, for 
          she is a believer.’” This was narrated by Imaam Ahmad, and by al-Qaadi

“The fornicatress and the fornicator, flog each of them with a hundred stripes. Let not pity withhold you in their case, in a punishment prescribed by Allaah” [al-Noor 24:2]   

For this punishment to be applicable, Allaah has laid down the condition that the act be witnessed by four men whose word can be trusted; a confession does away with the requirement of four witnesses.

1) My quistion is after 100 lashes the genrally( if person is of normal personality or not very strong) the man will remain alive or not ?

2) How hard or powerful this lashes will be?  is there any standard to apply so much strength on each lash?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Flogging in the case of hudood punishments is not meant to kill, rather it is 
    intended as a form of discipline and rebuke, and to purify the person of sin. Hence many fuqaha’ have pointed out that it must be done with 
    moderate force, and the person carrying out the punishment should not raise his arm so high that his armpit shows, and he should not use a new 
    whip, or strip the person of his clothing unless it is something like a thick coat, which should be removed. The person being punished should be 
    flogged standing, according to the majority of scholars; he should not be made to lie down and he should not be bound, and blows to the face, head 
    and genitals are to be avoided. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Rather the blows should be 
    distributed all over the body, so that each limb will have its share, but most of them should be on the fleshy parts such as the buttocks and 
    thighs, and the sensitive areas should be avoided, namely the head, face and genitals of men and women alike. 
He said concerning the person being punished that he should not be made to lie 
    down, or be bound, and we do not know of any difference of opinion concerning that. 
Ibn Mas’ood said:  It is not prescribed in our religion to make the offender lie 
    down or to tie him up or remove his clothing. The companions of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) flogged 
    offenders but there is no report that any of them made the offender lie down or tied him up or removed his clothing. 
His garment should not be removed, rather he is it acceptable if he is wearing one 
    or two garments, but if he is wearing a thick coat, it should be removed, because if it is left on he will not feel the blows. Ahmad said: If 
    winter garments are left on him, he will not feel the blows. Maalik said: His clothes should be removed [apart from that which covers the ‘awrah], 
    because the command to flog implies that the blows should be directly to his body. We have the view of Ibn Mas’ood, and we do not know of any of 
    the Sahaabah who differed with him. Allaah did not command us to strip the offender, rather he commanded us to flog him, so whoever is flogged 
    through his clothes has been flogged. 
And he said: Once this is established, then the whip should be of moderate 
    quality, not so new that it would cause injury and not so worn out that it hardly hurts him. It was narrated that a man confessed to the Messenger 
    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that he had committed zina, so the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) called for a whip and he was given a broken whip. He said, “Better than this.” So he was brought a brand new whip. He said, 
    “Something between these two.”  Narrated by Maalik from Zayd ibn Aslam in a mursal report; and it was narrated from Abu Hurayrah in a musnad 
    report. 
It was narrated from ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he said: Moderate blows with a 
    moderate whip. Not so harsh as to kill and not so weak as to be no deterrent. He should not raise his arm completely, or keep it so low that it 
    causes no pain. Ahmad said: His armpit should not show in any of the hudood punishments, i.e., he should not raise his arm so high, because the 
    point is to discipline him, not kill him. 
From al-Mughni, 1/141-142. 
From the above it is clear that an ordinary person will not usually be killed by 
    flogging; the purpose is to serve as a rebuke and discipline. And the believers should witness this punishment, as Allaah says (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 
“The fornicatress and the fornicator, flog each of them with a hundred stripes. 
    Let not pity withhold you in their case, in a punishment prescribed by Allaah, if you believe in Allaah and the Last Day. And let a party of the 
    believers witness their punishment”

13241,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13241,Treatment of prisoners-of-war in Islam,How are prisoners of war treated in Islam?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Islam is the religion of mercy and justice; it commands us to 
    call others to the religion of Allaah in a kind and good manner, and to 
    encourage people to enter this great religion. If some people persist in 
    rejecting the religion of Allaah and stand in the way of ruling by that 
    which Allaah has revealed on earth, or they fight against the call to 
    Allaah, then we give them the choice of three things: 

    Either they become Muslim; or if they refuse they pay the 
    jizyah (whereby they pay a specified amount to the Muslims in return for 
    being allowed to remain their land, and the Muslims undertake to protect 
    them); or, if they refuse that, there is nothing left but the way which they 
    themselves have chosen, which is fighting and dealing violently with those 
    who have persecuted the Muslims and put obstacles in the path of the Islamic 
    da’wah. In this way the Muslims will gain the upper hand and the enemies 
    will be humiliated; then when we have killed and wounded many of them and 
    gained the upper hand over them, we may take prisoners and bind a bond 
    firmly on them [cf. Muhammad 47:4], because in that case it is more in tune 
    with the idea of mercy by choice (not because we are afraid of them); at 
    that point war should not continue any longer than is necessary. War in 
    Islam should not be waged for the sole purpose of shedding blood or seeking 
    vengeance. If the Muslims capture them and take them to a place that has 
    been prepared for them, they should not harm them or torture them with 
    beatings, depriving them of food and water, leaving them out in the sun or 
    the cold, burning them with fire, or putting covers over their mouths, 
    ears and eyes and putting them in cages like animals. Rather they should 
    treat them with kindness and mercy, feed them well and encourage them to 
    enter Islam. 

    Thumaamah ibn Athaal – the leader of Bani Haneefah – was 
    brought (to Madeenah) as a prisoner and tied to one of the pillars of the 
    mosque. The Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came 
    to him and said, “What do you think, O Thumaamah?” He said, “What I think, O 
    Muhammad, is good. If you kill me, you will kill one with blood on his hands 
    – i.e., I will deserve to be killed because I have killed Muslims – and if 
    you release me you will release one who will be grateful. If you want money, 
    then ask, and I will give you whatever you want.” The Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) left him for three days, 
    and each day he would come and ask him similar questions, and Thumaamah 
    would give similar answers. After the third day, he commanded that he should 
    be released. Thumaamah went to a stand of date-palms near the mosque where 
    he bathed (did ghusl), then he came to the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) and said, “I bear witness that there is no god except 
    Allaah and I bear witness that Muhammad is the slave of Allaah and His 
    Messenger.” Then he said: “O Messenger of Allaah, by Allaah there was no one 
    on earth whose face was more hateful to me than yours, but now your face is 
    the most beloved of all faces to me.  By Allaah, there was no religion that 
    was more hateful to me than your religion, but now your religion has become 
    the most beloved of all religions to me. By Allaah, there was no land more 
    hateful to me than your land, but now your land has become the most beloved 
    to me. Your cavalry captured me when I was on my way to perform ‘Umrah, so 
    what do you think I should do?” 

    The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) congratulated him, and told him to go for ‘Umrah. When he came 
    to Makkah, someone asked him, “Have you changed your religion?” He said, 
    “No, but I have submitted with the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), and by Allaah you will not get a grain of 
    wheat from al-Yamaamah unless the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) gives permission.” 

    Think about this story, may Allaah bless you, and how the 
    kind treatment of Thumaamah led to his embracing Islam, which could not have 
    happened were it not primarily by the grace of Allaah, and also the kind 
    treatment which Thumaamah received. 

    In the Qur’aan, Allaah says of the righteous (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 

    “And they give food, in spite of their love for it (or for 
    the love of Him), to the Miskeen (the poor), the orphan, and the captive,

    (Saying): ‘We feed you seeking Allaah’s Countenance only. 
    We wish for no reward, nor thanks from you’”

    [al-Insaan 76:8-9]

    Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Ibn ‘Abbaas 
    said: in those days their prisoners were mushrikeen; on the day of Badr the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    commanded them to be kind to their prisoners, so they used to put them 
    before themselves when it came to food… Mujaahid said, this refers to the 
    one who is detained, i.e., they would give food to these prisoners even 
    though they themselves desired it and loved it.” 

    The ruling on tying up prisoners:

     It is well known that if prisoners are able to escape they 
    will not hesitate to do so, because they may be afraid of dying and they do 
    not know what awaits them. Hence the Muslims were commanded to tie up their 
    prisoners and to tie their hands to their necks, lest they run away. This is 
    something that still happens and is well known to all people.

     The wisdom behind permitting the taking of prisoners is so 
    as to weaken the enemy and ward off his evil by keeping him away from the 
    battlefield so that he cannot be effective or play any role; it also creates 
    a means of freeing Muslim prisoners by trading the prisoners whom we are 
    holding.

     Detaining prisoners

     Prisoners should be detained until it is decided what is the 
    best move. The ruler of the Muslims should detain prisoners until he decides 
    what is in the Muslims’ best interests. He may ransom them for money, or 
    exchange them for Muslim prisoners, or release them for nothing in return, 
    or distribute them among the Muslims as slaves, or kill the men, but not the 
    women and children, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) forbade killing the latter. The purpose behind detaining 
    prisoners is so that the Muslims may be protected from their evil. The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to enjoin the 
    Muslims to treat prisoners well, whereas the Romans and those who came 
    before them the Assyrians and Pharaohs, all used to put out their prisoners’ 
    eyes with hot irons, and flay them alive, feeding their skins to dogs, such 
    that the prisoners preferred death to life.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

    much good thereby. 

    Secondly: 

    Your anxieties and fears about your children growing up as 
    non-Muslims – if they are born from this woman – reflects a commendable 
    concern on your part for your religion and the religion of your children. 
    Undoubtedly this good attitude is a good thing. In order to find peace of 
    mind you need to make a great deal of du’aa’ and ask Allaah to protect your 
    religious commitment and that of your children. You have to pray istikhaarah 
    as prescribed in Islam, and ask Allaah to guide you and help you to make the 
    right decision as far as your religious commitment is concerned,  and choose 
    whether to stay with her and have children with her, or to leave her and 
    marry a committed Muslim woman with whom you will feel confident – by 
    Allaah’s leave – about your children. Be certain that whoever gives up 
    something for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will compensate him with something 
    better than it, as is proven in the hadeeth of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him). You can make the most of your wife’s being 
    so attached to you to explain to her that if there is a conflict between 
    your love for her and the soundness of your religious commitment, then the 
    soundness of your religious commitment has to take priority. Perhaps this 
    will motivate her to enter the true religion of Allaah – Islam. 

    You should note that you cannot force her to enter Islam 
    without conviction, because entering the religion of Islam by force will not 
    benefit her, as Ibn Katheer mentioned (1/211). 

    See also The effects of marriage to kitaabi women (i.e., 
    Jewish and Christian women), question no. 
    20227. 

    Thirdly: 

    If your circumstances are conducive to your raising your 
    children as Muslims and protecting them from religious and moral deviation, 
    and your wife and her family will not be able to influence them in those 
    areas, then there is nothing wrong with trying to have children with your 
    wife, even if she remains a Christian, because having children is also the 
    wife’s right, and that may help her to learn about Islam and look into it as 
    she has promised to do. 

    Fourthly: 

    You should try to move to a Muslim country where you will be 
    able to give your children a sound upbringing, whether you stay with this 
    wife or marry someone else, because staying in the kaafir lands is not 
    permissible except in cases of necessity or where it serves the interests of 
    the Muslims – such as staying there to call people to Allaah, or to study 
    and acquire knowledge that the Muslims need but is not available in their 
    countries – so long as one is able to practise Islam openly and call others 
    to Islam, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “I disavow any Muslim who stays among the mushrikeen.” Narrated 
    by Abu Dawood, 2645; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 

    For more information on this issue please see question no. 
    13363. 

    Fifthly: 

    In the event of a divorce, then the wife is entitled to the 
    delayed mahr (dowry), if applicable. With regard to accommodation and 
    maintenance, that depends on the type of divorce: 

    If a man has given his wife one revocable talaaq (divorce), 
    then she is entitled to accommodation and maintenance during the ‘iddah; she 
    may also inherit from him and he from her (if either of them dies) during 
    this period, because they are still married. The evidence that a woman 
    divorced by a revocable talaaq is entitled to accommodation is the verse in 
    which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “O Prophet! When you divorce women, divorce them at their 
    ‘Iddah (prescribed periods) and count (accurately) their ‘Iddah (periods). 
    And fear Allaah your Lord (O Muslims). And turn them not out of their 
    (husband’s) homes nor shall they (themselves) leave, except in case they are 
    guilty of some open illegal sexual intercourse. And those are the set limits 
    of Allaah. And whosoever transgresses the set limits of Allaah, then indeed 
    he has wronged himself. You (the one who divorces his wife) know not it may 
    be that Allaah will afterward bring some new thing to pass (i.e. to return 
    her back to you if that was the first or second divorce)”

    [al-Talaaq 65:1]

    If she does not go back to him until after the ‘iddah has 
    ended, then she can only go back to him with a new marriage contract. 

    If a man divorces his wife with an irrevocable talaaq, then 
    she is not entitled to accommodation and maintenance during the ‘iddah, 
    unless she is pregnant. 

    Irrevocable divorce is of two types: 

    (i)The “lesser” type, which is 
    divorce before the marriage has been consummated, and the divorce in return 
    for some compensation or payment.

    (ii)The “greater” type, which is 
    the third of three talaaqs.

    The evidence that a woman who has been divorced by an 
    irrevocable talaaq is not entitled to maintenance or accommodation is the 
    report narrated by Muslim (1480) from al-Sha’bi who said: I entered upon 
    Faatimah bint Qays and asked her about the ruling of the Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). She said that her husband 
    divorced her irrevocably and she referred the matter to the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to judge with regard 
    to accommodation and maintenance. She said: He did not grant me 
    accommodation or maintenance, and he told me to observe my ‘iddah in the 
    house of Ibn Umm Maktoom. 

    According to another report also narrated by Muslim she said: 
    I mentioned that to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) and he said: “You are not entitled to any maintenance or 
    accommodation.” According to a version narrated by Abu Dawood: “You are not 
    entitled to any maintenance unless you are pregnant.”

13254,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13254,Divorce from a husband who is addicted to smoking,"My husband is addicted to smoking and he suffers from asthma. There have been many problems between us concerning his giving up smoking. Five months ago my husband prayed two rak’ahs to Allaah and swore that he would never smoke again, but he started smoking again one week after making that vow, and the problems between us started again. I asked him for a divorce but he promised me that he would not start smoking again and that he would give it up forever, but I am not confident that he will be able to keep his word. What is your opinion, what is the expiation for his broken vow and what do you advise me to do?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Smoking is one of the evil things that are forbidden, and it 
    causes a great deal of harm. Allaah says in His Holy Book, in Soorat 
    al-Maa’idah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They ask you (O 
    Muhammad) what is lawful for them (as food ). Say: ‘Lawful unto you are 
    At‑Tayyibaat [all kinds of Halaal (lawful‑good) foods which Allaah has made 
    lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables 
    and fruits)]’” [al-Maa'idah 5:4]

     And He says in Soorat al-A’raaf, describing the Prophet 
    Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him):

     “he allows them as lawful At‑Tayyibaat (i.e. all good and 
    lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), and prohibits 
    them as unlawful Al‑Khabaa’ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards 
    things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods)”
[al-A’raaf 5:157] 

    Undoubtedly smoking is an evil and unlawful thing, so your 
    husband must give it up and keep away from it, in obedience to Allaah and 
    His Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and so as to 
    avoid that which incurs the wrath of Allaah, and to protect his religious 
    commitment and health, and to maintain good relations with you.  As 
    expiation for his broken oath he must offer kafaarat yameen, as well as 
    repenting to Allaah for starting to smoke again. This expiation means 
    feeding or clothing ten poor persons, or freeing a believing slave; it is 
    sufficient to give them dinner or lunch, or to give each of them half a saa’ 
    of the staple food of the country Which is equivalent to a kilo and a half.
    

    We advise you not to ask him for a divorce if he prays and he 
    is a man of good conduct, and if he gives up smoking. But if he persists in 
    this sin there is nothing to prevent you from asking him for a divorce.","Shaykh Ibn Baaz, al-Fataawa al-Jaami’ah li’l-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, part 2, p"

    It is not permissible for a woman to uncover her face in 
    front of her husband’s father through breastfeeding, according to the 
    correct view which was favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, because the 
    Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The same 
    people become mahrams through breastfeeding as those who are mahrams through 
    blood ties.” The husband’s father is not a mahram for his son’s wife through 
    blood ties, but he becomes a mahram through the marriage tie, because Allaah 
    says (interpretation of the meaning):

    “Forbidden to you (for marriage) 
    are: … the wives of your sons who (spring) from your own loins”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:23]

     A son through breastfeeding is not the same as a son from 
    one’s own loins. On this basis, if a woman’s husband has a father through 
    breastfeeding, then she must observe hijaab in front of him and not uncover 
    her face in front of him. If we assume that she were to separate from his 
    son through breastfeeding, it would not be permissible for her to marry him, 
    in order to be on the safe side, because this is the view of the majority of 
    scholars.","Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen in al-Fataawa al-Jaami’ah li’l-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, part 3, p. 822"

    If that is done by means of plucking, then it is haraam, and 
    indeed it is one of the major sins, because it is the “namas” for 
    which the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed 
    the one who does it. But if it is done by cutting or shaving, then it was 
    regarded as makrooh by some scholars and forbidden by others who regarded it 
    as a kind of “namas”. They said: “ ‘Namas’ does not only mean 
    plucking, rather it is a general word which includes all ways of changing 
    the hair for which Allaah has not granted permission, if it is on the face.” 
    But what we think is that women should not do that unless the hair of the 
    eyebrows is so thick that it hangs down over the eyes and affects her 
    vision, in which case it is o.k. to remove that which is causing the 
    problem.","Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, part 3, p. 866"

    Good treatment of girls and others means giving them an 
    Islamic upbringing, teaching them the truth, striving to keep them chaste 
    and keep them away from the things that Allaah has forbidden, such as 
    tabarruj (wanton display) etc. The same applies to taking care of one’s 
    sisters and sons, so that all of them will be brought up to obey Allaah and 
    His Messenger, and will keep away from the things that Allaah has forbidden, 
    and will do their duty towards Allaah. Hence we know that good treatment 
    does not simply mean giving them food and drink and clothing only; rather

13261,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13261,Uncovering one’s face in front of non-mahram relatives,"There are two married brothers living in one apartment. Is it permissible for their wives to uncover their faces in front of one another’s husband, knowing that both of them are righteous?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If the families are living all together, then the women must 
    observe hijaab in front of those who are not their mahrams. It is not 
    permissible for the wife of one brother to uncover her face in front of his 
    brother, because his brother is like any other man in the street with regard 
    to looking and being non-mahram. It is also not permissible for his brother 
    to be alone with her if he (the husband) is outside the home. This is a 
    problem which is affecting many people, such as when brothers are living in 
    the same home and one of them is married. It is not permissible for the one 
    who is married to leave his wife with his brother if he goes out to work or 
    to study, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “No man should be alone with a [non-mahram] woman.” And he said: 
    “Beware of entering upon women.” They said, “O Messenger of Allaah, what do 
    you think about the brother-in-law [meaning the husband’s relatives]?” He 
    said, “The brother-in-law is death.” 

    There are always questions about the crime of adultery (zina) 
    in such cases, where a man goes out and leaves his wife and his brother in 
    the house, then the Shaytaan tempts them and he commits adultery with her – 
    Allaah forbid – with his brother’s wife. This is worse than committing 
    adultery with his neighbour’s wife, indeed it is more terrible than that. I 
    want to say something that so that I will have discharged my responsibility 
    before Allaah. It is not permissible for a man to leave his wife in the same 
    house as his brother, no matter what the circumstances, even if his brother 
    is one of the most trustworthy, sincere and righteous of people, for the 
    Shaytaan flows through the son of Adam like blood, and sexual desire knows 
    no bounds, especially among young people. 

    But what should we do if two brothers are living in the same 
    house and one of them is married? Does that mean that when he goes out he 
    must take his wife out to work with him? 

    The answer is no, but the house may be divided in two, one 
    half for the brother on his own, with a door that can be locked, for which 
    the key should be kept by the husband when he goes out to work. So the wife 
    will be in a separate part of the house, and the brother will be in another 
    separate part of the house. But the brother may argue with his brother and 
    say, “Why are you doing that? Don’t you trust me?” 

    The answer to that is to tell him, “I am doing this in your 
    own best interests, because the Shaytaan flows through the son of Adam like 
    blood. Maybe he will tempt you and desire may overwhelm reason, in which 
    case you will do something haraam. I am doing this to protect you. It is in 
    your best interests as well as mine.” If he gets angry because of this then 
    let him get angry and do not worry about him. 

    I am telling you these things so as to discharge my 
    responsibility before Allaah, and your reckoning will be with Allaah.

     With regard to uncovering the face, it is haraam; it is not 
    permissible for a woman to uncover in front of her husband’s brother because 
    he is a stranger (non-mahram) to her, so he is just like any other man in 
    the street.","Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen in al-Fataawa al-Jaami’ah li’l-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, part 3, p. 806"

The time for giving it to them is not when they reach adolescence, rather it is when he feels that they have become mature after they reach adolescence. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And try orphans (as regards their intelligence) until they reach the age of marriage; if then you find sound judgement in them, release their property to them”

 A person is no longer considered to be an orphan once he reaches adolescence, and adolescence is recognized by a number of things: the growth of coarse hair in the pubic region, reaching the age of fifteen, and emitting maniy (i.e., reaching sexual climax) whether awake or asleep.

It was narrated that Abu’l-Dardaa’ (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah created the disease and the cure, so treat disease but do not treat it with anything that is haraam.”
(Narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Mu’jam al-Kabeer, 24/254. This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 1633).
It was narrated that Usaamah ibn Shurayk (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: the Bedouins said, “O Messenger of Allaah, should we not use medicine?” He said, “Yes, O slaves of Allaah, use medicine, for Allaah did not create any disease but He also created the cure for it, except for one disease.” They said, “O Messenger of Allaah, what is it?” He said, “Old age.”

2 – Using medicine does not cancel out the idea of putting one’s trust in Allaah
Ibn al-Qayyim said:
In the saheeh ahaadeeth there is the command to use medicine, and these ahaadeeth state that this does not contradict the idea of putting one’s trust in Allaah, just as warding off hunger, thirst, heat and cold by means of their opposites does not contradict it. Rather the reality of Tawheed cannot be perfected without following the means which Allaah has created in order to reach ends, both by His universal will and in His laws that He has prescribed. Ignoring this matter undermines the very essence of putting one’s trust in Allaah, just as it undermines the concept of Allaah’s command and wisdom, and weakens it so that the one who does not use the means to an end thinks that not using them is a stronger form of putting one’s trust in Allaah. But not using the means to an end is a sign of weakness which contradict the idea of putting one’s trust in Allaah, the essence of which is the reliance of the heart on Allaah to provide that which will benefit a person in this world and in the Hereafter, and to ward off that which will harm him in this world and in the Hereafter. But it is essential to depend on use of the means, otherwise one is denying the wisdom of Allaah and the laws which He has prescribed. So the slave of Allaah should not call his helplessness dependence on Allaah, or call his dependence on Allaah helplessness.

All prophets came with the same message","Praise be to Allah.How was Adam created?
Allah created Adam with His Hand and breathed into him his soul created by Him, and told His angels to prostrate to him. 
Allah created Adam from dust, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, the likeness of ‘Isa (Jesus) before Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then (He) said to him: ‘Be!’ — and he was.” [Al ‘Imran 3:59] 
When Allah had completed the creation of Adam, He commanded the angels to prostrate to him , so they prostrated, except for Iblis, who was present but he refused and was too arrogant to prostrate to Adam: 
“(Remember) when your Lord said to the angels: ‘Truly, I am going to create man from clay. So when I have fashioned him and breathed into him (his) soul created by Me, then you fall down prostrate to him.’ So the angels prostrated themselves, all of them, except Iblis (Satan), he was proud and was one of the disbelievers.” [Sad 38:71-74 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Then Allah told the angels that He was going to place Adam on earth and make generations after generations of his offspring, as He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels: ‘Verily, I am going to place (mankind) generations after generations on earth’.” [al-Baqarah 2:30] 
Allah taught Adam all the names 
“And He taught Adam all the names (of everything).”  [al-Baqarah 2:31 – interpretation of the meaning] 
When Iblis refused to prostrate to Adam, Allah expelled him and cursed him: 
“(Allah) said: ‘Then get out from here; for verily, you are outcast.  And verily, My Curse is on you till the Day of Recompense’” [Sad 38:77-78 – interpretation of the meaning] 
When Iblis knew of his fate, he asked Allah to give him respite until the Day of Resurrection:
“[Iblis (Satan)] said: ‘My Lord! Give me then respite till the Day the (dead) are resurrected.’
(Allah) said: ‘Verily, you are of those allowed respite till the Day of the time appointed’.” [Sad 38:79-81 – interpretation of the meaning] 
When Allah granted him that, he declared war on Adam and his descendants, made disobedience attractive to them and tempted them to commit immoral actions: 
“[Iblis (Satan)] said: ‘By Your Might, then I will surely, mislead them all, Except Your chosen slaves amongst them (i.e. faithful, obedient, true believers of Islamic Monotheism).’” [Sad 38:82-83 – interpretation of the meaning] 
How was Eve created?
Allah created Adam , and from him He created his wife, and from their progeny He created men and women, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (Adam), and from him (Adam) He created his wife [Hawwa (Eve)], and from them both He created many men and women.” [al-Nisa 4:1] 
Then Allah caused Adam and his wife to dwell in Paradise, as a test for them. He commanded them to eat of the fruits of Paradise but He forbade them to eat from one tree: 
“And We said: ‘O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise and eat both of you freely with pleasure and delight, of things therein as wherever you will, but come not near this tree or you both will be of the Zalimun (wrong-doers)’” [al-Baqarah 2:35 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Allah warned Adam and his wife against the Shaytan, as He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O Adam! Verily, this is an enemy to you and to your wife. So let him not get you both out of Paradise, so that you will be distressed” [Ta-Ha 20:117] 
Then the Shaytan whispered to Adam and his wife, and tempted them to eat from the forbidden tree. Adam forgot and could not resist the temptation, so he disobeyed his Lord and ate from that tree: 
“Then Shaytan (Satan) whispered to him, saying : ‘O Adam! Shall I lead you to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that will never waste away?’ Then they both ate of the tree, and so their private parts became manifest to them, and they began to cover themselves with the leaves of the Paradise for their covering. Thus did Adam disobey his Lord, so he went astray” [Ta-Ha 20:120-121 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Their Lord called to them and said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Did I not forbid you from that tree and tell you: Verily, Shaytan (Satan) is an open enemy unto you?” [al-A’raf 7:22] 
When they ate from the tree, they regretted what they had done, and said: 
“Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You forgive us not, and bestow not upon us Your Mercy, we shall certainly be of the losers” [al-A’raf 7:23 – interpretation of the meaning] 
What was Adam’s sin?
The sin of Adam stemmed from desire, not from arrogance, hence Allah guided him to repent and He accepted that from him: 
“Then Adam received from his Lord Words. And his Lord pardoned him (accepted his repentance). Verily, He is the One Who forgives (accepts repentance), the Most Merciful” [al-Baqarah 2:37 – interpretation of the meaning] 
This is the way for Adam and his descendents: whoever sins then repents sincerely, Allah will accept his repentance: 
“And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and forgives sins, and He knows what you do” [al-Shura 42:25 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Why did Allah send Adam to earth?
Then Allah sent Adam and his wife, and Iblis, down to the earth, and He sent down Revelation to them and He sent the messengers to them.  So whoever believes will enter Paradise and whoever disbelieves will enter Hell: 
“We said: ‘Get down all of you from this place (the Paradise), then whenever there comes to you Guidance from Me, and whoever follows My Guidance, there shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve.
But those who disbelieve and belie Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) — such are the dwellers of the Fire. They shall abide therein forever’” [al-Baqarah 2:38-39 – interpretation of the meaning] 
When Allah sent them all down to the earth, the conflict between faith and disbelief, between truth and falsehood, between good and evil, began, and it will continue until Allah inherits the earth and everyone on it: 
“(Allah) said: ‘Get down, one of you an enemy to the other [i.e. Adam, Hawwa, (Eve), and Shaytan (Satan)]. On earth will be a dwelling place for you and an enjoyment for a time.’ [al-A’raf 7:24 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Allah is Able to do all things. He created Adam with no father or mother, and He created Hawwa from a father with no mother, and He created ‘Isa from a mother with no father , and He created us from a father and a mother. 
Allah created Adam from dust, then He made his descendants from semen of despised water, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Who made everything He has created good and He began the creation of man from clay.
Then He made his offspring from semen of despised water (male and female sexual discharge).
Then He fashioned him in due proportion, and breathed into him the soul (created by Allah for that person); and He gave you hearing (ears), sight (eyes) and hearts. Little is the thanks you give!” [al-Sajdah 32:7-9]

How man is created in the womb, and the stages which he goes through, is a wondrous thing. Allah mentioned this in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And indeed We created man (Adam) out of an extract of clay (water and earth).
Thereafter, We made him (the offspring of Adam) as a Nutfah (mixed drops of the male and female sexual discharge and lodged it) in a safe lodging (womb of the woman).
Then We made the Nutfah into a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood), then We made the clot into a little lump of flesh, then We made out of that little lump of flesh bones, then We clothed the bones with flesh, and then We brought it forth as another creation. So Blessed is Allah, the Best of creators.” [al-Muminun 23:12-14] 
Allah Alone creates whatever He wills. He knows what is in the wombs, and He decrees provision and lifespans (for His creatures): 
“To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He wills. He bestows female (offspring) upon whom He wills, and bestows male (offspring) upon whom He wills.
Or He bestows both males and females, and He renders barren whom He wills. Verily, He is the All-Knower and is Able to do all things” [al-Shura 42:49-50 – interpretation of the meaning] 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has appointed an angel over the womb. He says, ‘O Lord, a drop of semen (nutfah); O Lord, a clot (‘alaqah); O Lord, a little lump of flesh (mudghah).’ Then if Allah wishes (to complete) its creation, the angel asks, (O Lord) male or female, wretched (doomed to Hell) or blessed (destined for Paradise)? How much will his provision be? And what will his lifespan be?’ So that is written whilst (the child) is still in the mother's womb.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 318) 
Honoring the children of Adam
Allah honoured the children of Adam and subjugated for their benefit that which is in the heavens and on earth: 
“See you not (O men) that Allah has subjected for you whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, and has completed and perfected His Graces upon you, (both) apparent (i.e. Islamic Monotheism, and the lawful pleasures of this world, including health, good looks) and hidden [i.e. one’s faith in Allah (of Islamic Monotheism), knowledge, wisdom, guidance for doing righteous deeds, and also the pleasures and delights of the Hereafter in Paradise]? [Luqman 31:20 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Allah has distinguished and honoured man with reason by which he knows his Lord, Creator and Provider, and by which he knows what is good and evil, what will benefit him and what will harm him, what is halal and what is haram. 
Allah did not create man and leave him alone with no path to follow. Rather, Allah revealed the Books and sent messengers to guide mankind to the Straight Path. 
Allah created people with a natural inclination towards monotheism (Tawhid – belief in the Oneness of Allah). Every time they deviated from that, Allah sent a prophet to bring them back to the Straight Path. The first of the prophets was Adam and the last was Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon them): 
“Mankind were one community and Allah sent Prophets with glad tidings and warnings, and with them He sent down the Scripture in truth to judge between people in matters wherein they differed.” [al-Baqarah 2:213 – interpretation of the meaning] 
All the messengers called people to the same truth, which is the worship of Allah Alone and to reject all gods besides Him: 
“And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a messenger (proclaiming): “Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Taghut (all false deities, i.e. do not worship Taghut besides Allah).” [al-Nahl 16:36 – interpretation of the meaning] 
The religion with Allah is Islam
The religion with which Allah sent the Prophets and Messengers was the same, i.e., Islam: 
“Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam” [Al ‘Imran 3:19 – interpretation of the meaning] 
The last of the heavenly Books which Allah revealed was the Quran, confirming the Books which came before it, and as a guidance to all of mankind: 
“(This is) a Book which We have revealed unto you (O Muhammad) in order that you might lead mankind out of darkness (of disbelief and polytheism) into light.” [Ibrahim 14:1 – interpretation of the meaning] 
The last of the prophets and messengers whom Allah sent was Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): 
“Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the last (end) of the prophets” [al-Ahzab 33:40 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Allah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to all of mankind: 
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah’” [al-A’raf 7:158 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Quran is the last revelation
The Quran is the last and greatest of the heavenly Books and Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the last and best of the prophets and messengers. 
Allah has abrogated all of the heavenly Books with the Quran, so whoever does not follow the Quran and enter Islam and believe in the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and follow him, his deeds will not be accepted: 
“And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers” [Al ‘Imran 3:85 – interpretation of the meaning]
All prophets came with the same message
The religion which was brought by Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) confirms the message brought by the prophets before him, in its basic principles and advocation of noble characteristics, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
 “He (Allah) has ordained for you the same religion (Islamic Monotheism) which He ordained for Nuh (Noah), and that which We have revealed to you (O Muhammad), and that which We ordained for Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa (Moses) and ‘Isa (Jesus) saying you should establish religion (i.e. to do what it orders you to do practically) and make no divisions] in it (religion) (i.e. various sects in religion).” [al-Shura 42:13]
