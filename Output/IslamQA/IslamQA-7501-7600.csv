7501,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7501,What is the ruling    on non-menstrual bleeding?,"What is the ruling on non-menstrual bleeding? My period usually lasts for nine days each month, but sometimes I have bleeding at other times. This bleeding is much lighter and it only lasts for a day or two. Should I still pray and fast when that happens, or should I stop and make it up later on?",,,"Praise be to Allah.This extra, non-menstrual bleeding is from a vein and is not counted as part of the regular period. A woman who knows her regular cycle should not pray, fast, touch the Mus-haf or have intercourse with her husband during the time of her period. When her period is over, then she should do ghusl and after that the rulings of women who are taahir (pure) apply to her. If she sees any blood or yellow or brownish discharge after that, then this is istihaadah (non-menstrual bleeding/discharge) and she does not have to stop praying etc.",Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz
7505,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7505,Salat al-Naariyah,"“Allahumma salli salatan kaamilatan wasallim salaaman taamman ‘ala sayyidina muhammadin alladhi(allathi in some prose) tan’hil bihi il uq’ad· watatafarrij bih il karb· wataq’dhi bih il hawaa’ij· wa tanaal bih ir raghaa’ib· wa hasan al khawaayitam wa yastasq il ghamaam bi wajhih il kareem wa ‘ala ‘aalihi wa sah’bihi fee kulli lamhatin wa nafs” 
The above recitation is called salat un naaria in india and recited 4444 times whenever a calamity falls in a house  by bringing many students and the chief of a madhrasaa. 
1.  What is the meaning of the above words and is there any shirk in the wordings?   
2. People say if there is no shirk we can continue reciting because it is not harmful because it is a type of dhikr and it reminds them of allah and that we are doing some kind of additional dhikr to  bring us closer to allah and to removesome museebath. 
3. What is the ruling on maulid recitation· is there any harm in reciting it periodically by calling some students of madhrasaa or imam of masjid.",,,"Praise be to Allah.[The translation of these words is as follows:
“O Allah, send perfect blessings and complete peace upon our master Muhammad by virtue of whom [as some of them say] all obstacles are removed, distress is relieved, needs are met, desires are fulfilled and a good end may be achieved and by virtue of whose noble face clouds may be sent, and [send blessings and peace] upon his family and companions with every breath and glance.”] 
Answer: 
1.The words of this innovated prayer are clear enough, but there is nothing wrong with explaining them further. 
“obstacles are removed” means, a way out is found from whatever obstacles and difficult matters one is faced with.
The phrase may also mean “by virtue of whom anger is calmed.” 
“distress is relieved” means anxiety and grief are taken away. 
“needs are met” means one gets what one is trying to achieve. 
“desires are fulfilled and a good end may be achieved” means his wishes are fulfilled whether that is in this world or in the Hereafter, one of which is that one meets a good end. 
“by virtue of whose noble face clouds may be sent” means that he is asked to pray to Allah to send rain. 
2.What some people have told you – that this prayer does not involve shirk and that it is permissible for you to continue to recite it – is wrong. This so-called prayer includes things which clearly go against Islam, such as the following: 
(i)It is supposed to be said at times of calamity. This is a contrived reason for an innovated act of worship.
(ii)It is supposed to be recited a set number of times, 4444 times. This is a contrived amount for an innovated act of worship.
(iii)It is supposed to be recited in a communal fashion. This is a contrived method for an innovated act of worship
(iv)It contains phrases which go against Islam, which constitute shirk and which are an exaggeration about the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It attributes to him actions which cannot be attributed to anyone other than Allah, such as meeting people’s needs, relieving distress, fulfilling their desires and granting a good end. Allah commanded His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him):
“Say: ‘It is not in my power to cause you harm, or to bring you to the Right Path’”
[al-Jinn 72:21 – interpretation of the meaning]
(v)It ignores what is taught in the sharee’ah, and makes up a contrived prayer and supplication. This implies that one is accusing the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) of failing to explain everything that the people need, and that one is trying to fill gaps in the sharee’ah.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever innovates anything in this matter of ours (Islam) that is not a part of it, will have it rejected”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2550; Muslim, 1718).
According to a report narrated by Muslim (1718), he said: “Whoever does any action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam) will have it rejected.”
Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “This hadeeth represents one of the most important basic principles of Islam. It is like a yardstick for measuring the outward appearance of actions, just as the hadeeth ‘Actions are but by intentions’ is a yardstick for measuring the inward nature of actions. Just as actions which are not done for the sake of Allah bring no reward to the one who does them, so too actions which are not done in accordance with the command of Allah and His Messenger are rejected and thrown back at the one who does them. Everyone who innovates something in the religion for which Allah and His Messenger have not granted permission, that action has nothing to do with the religion.”(Jaami’ al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hukam, 1/180) 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “This hadeeth is one of the most important basic principles of Islam and is one of the most comprehensive sayings of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It is a clear rejection of bid’ah and innovations. The second report adds a further idea, which is that some people may persist in doing some innovated action (bid’ah) for which there is a precedent, and when the first report – ‘Whoever innovates anything…’ – is quoted as proof, such a person may say, ‘But I did not innovate anything. Then the second report – ‘Whoever does any action…’ – may be quoted, which clearly states that all innovated actions are rejected, whether the one who does them invented them or they were previously invented. This hadeeth is one of those which should be memorized and used in denouncing evil actions, and it should be propagated widely.”(Sharh Muslim, 12/16) 
3.With regard to celebrating the Mawlid (birthday of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)), doing this is bid’ah. If it was good, those who love the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) more than we do would have done it before us, i.e., the Sahaabah, may Allah be pleased with them. Most of what is recited on this occasion are weak or fabricated reports of the life of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and it involves exaggeration about our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). There follow the comments of the scholars: 
(a)Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the one who completes the reading of the Qur’aan each year on the night of the birthday of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – is that mustahabb or not? 
He replied: 
“Praise be to Allah. For the people to come together to eat on the two Eids and the days of Tashreeq is Sunnah. This is one of the symbols of Islam which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) set out for the Muslims. Helping the poor by giving them food during Ramadaan is also one of the ways of Islam. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever gives a fasting person food to break his fast will have a reward like his.’ Giving poor Qur’aan-readers that which will help them to devote their time to the Qur’aan is a righteous deed at any time, and whoever helps them in this manner will have a share in the reward. 
But taking as special occasions days which are not prescribed in Islam – such as one of the nights of Rabee’ al-Awwal which is called Laylat al-Mawlid (the night of the Prophet’s birthday), or some of the nights of Rajab, or the eighteenth of Dhu’l-Hijjah, or the first Friday of Rajab, or the eighth of Shawwaal, which the ignorant call ‘Eid al-Abraar (the Feast of the Righteous)’ – these are bid’ahs which the salaf did not regard as mustahabb and they did not do these things. And Allah knows best.”(al-Fatawa al-Kubraa, 4/415) 
(b)Ibn al-Haaj said: 
“Some of them commit actions at this time which go against this meaning. When the month of Rabee’ al-Awwal begins, they hasten to indulge in idle entertainment, playing the daff (hand-drum) and reed flute, and other things as mentioned above. 
Whoever wants to weep, let him weep for himself and for Islam, and how it and its people and those who follow the Sunnah have become alienated. If they simply wanted to sing songs and entertain themselves, I wish that they would limit themselves to that. But some of them try to follow proper etiquette, so they start the Mawlid with the recitation of Qur’aan. So they look for the one who can recite in the most melodious fashion and provoke enjoyment, and he reads ten aayahs. There are several things wrong with this:
(i)the way in which the reciter reads in this manner which is condemned in sharee’ah, with a quavering tone like that of a singer. This has been discussed above.
(ii)This involves a lack of proper respect towards the Book of Allah.
(iii)They read Qur’aan briefly before turning to what they really desire, which is to listen to the entertainment of the tambourine and reed-flute, and the singing and quavering tones of the singers, etc.
(iv)They show outwardly something different from that which is in their hearts. This is the essence of hypocrisy, whereby a person makes an outward display of something when deep inside he really means something else – this is wrong except in cases specifically exempted by sharee’ah. They start with Qur’aan recitation when the thoughts of some of them are really focused on the singing.
(v)Some of them cut the recitation short, because they are thinking too much of the pleasure of that which comes after it, as mentioned above.
(vi)If the Qur’aan reading goes on for a long time, some of the audience begin to show signs of boredom, and they do not settle down until the entertainment they like begins. This is not what is meant by the description which Allah gives of the humble believers, because they love to hear the words of the Lord, as He says in praise of them (interpretation of the meaning):
‘And when they listen to what has been sent down to the Messenger (Muhammad), you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of the truth they have recognized. They say: “Our Lord! We believe; so write us down among the witnesses”’[al-Maa’idah 5:83]
This is how Allah describes those who listen to His words. But some of these people do the opposite of that. After listening to the word of their Lord, they get up to dance and celebrate and enjoy themselves in unseemly ways. “Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return” [al-Baqarah 2:156 – interpretation of the meaning. This phrase is an expression of grief and sorrow] for the lack of shame for committing sins. They do the deeds of the Shaytaan and seek reward from the Lord of the Worlds, claiming that they are doing acts of worship and goodness. Would that only the lowest of people did that, but now this problem has become widespread and you see those who claim to have some knowledge and good deeds doing that, and even some of those who claim to be shaykhs, i.e., those who have followers. All of them are included in what is said above. 
It is strange that they have been deceived by this trick of the accursed Shaytaan. Do you not see that a wine-drinker, when the wine first starts to take effect, he begins to move his head non-stop. When the effect becomes stronger, he loses his shame and dignity before those who are with him, and what he wants to conceal will be exposed to his companions. Look at this singer, may Allah have mercy on you and us. When he starts to sing, you will see people who have dignity and respect, who appear decent and are followed by people of knowledge, falling silent when he starts to sing. Then they start to move their heads a little, exactly like wine-drinkers, as described above. Then when they really start to enjoy the entertainment, they lose their shyness and dignity, exactly like the wine-drinkers, so they get up and start to dance and shout and weep in a show of fake humility. They move in and out and raise their arms and heads towards the heavens as if receiving divine inspiration. They start to foam at the mouth and may even rend their garments and play with their beards. 
This is obviously something to be denounced, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade wasting money, and rending one’s garments is obviously included in that. 
Secondly, this obviously goes beyond the limits of common sense, because they act like crazy people most of the time.”(al-Madkhal, 2/5-7) 
(c)The Standing Committee said: 
“Celebrating the birthday of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is not permitted because it is an invented bid’ah (innovation) which was not done by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or by his rightly-guided successors (al-khulafa’ al-raashideen), or by the scholars of the best three generations [i.e., the first three generations of Islam].” 
(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 3/2) 
(d)Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked: is it permissible for the Muslims to hold celebrations in the mosque to commemorate the life of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on the night of 12 Rabee’ al-Awwal, to celebrate the Mawlid or birthday of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), without taking that day off as an “Eid”? We are having some disputes concerning this. Some say that it is a bid’ah hasanah (“a good innovation”) and some say that it is not a good innovation. 
He replied: 
“The Muslims should not celebrate the birthday of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), whether on the night of 12 Rabee’ al-Awwal or on any other date, just as they should not celebrate the birthday of anyone other than the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), because celebrating birthdays is an innovation which has been introduced into the religion.  The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not celebrate his birthday during his lifetime, and he is the one who conveyed the religion and laws from Allah. He did not enjoin that, and it was not done by his rightly guided successors or by any of his Companions or those who followed them in goodness during the best three generations. So it is known to be an innovation, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever innovates anything in this matter of ours (Islam) that is not a part of it, will have it rejected’ (Saheeh – agreed upon). According to a report narrated by Muslim, which al-Bukhaari narrated in a mu’allaq majzoom report: “Whoever does any action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam) will have it rejected.” 
Celebrating the Mawlid is not in accordance with the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), rather it is something which the people innovated and introduced into their religion during later centuries, so it is to be rejected. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say in his khutbah (sermon) on Fridays: ‘The best of speech is the Book of Allah and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The most evil of things are those which are newly-invented, and every innovation is a going-astray.’ This was narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh. It was also narrated by al-Nasaa’i with a jayyid isnaad, adding the words, ‘and every going-astray leads to Hell.’ 
Instead of celebrating the birthday of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), we should study his seerah (biography) and the history of his life during the jaahiliyyah and Islam, in schools, mosques and elsewhere. That includes describing the circumstances of his birth and death, with no need to innovate celebrations which are not prescribed by Allah or His Messenger, and for which there is no evidence in sharee’ah. 
Allah is the Source of Strength. We ask Allah to grant guidance and strength to all the Muslims and to help them to follow the Sunnah and avoid bid’ah.”

Can the fasts be made up in such cases or not? What is the ruling in such a case?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If she did not fast because she was not able to, then she has to make up the fasts she has missed in these four years, when she becomes able to. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

‘Imraan ibn Husayn said: “I had haemorrhoids and I asked the

 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about that. He said,
    ‘Pray standing; if you cannot do that, then (pray) sitting; if you cannot do that
    then (pray) on your side.” (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 1066).
    If you can stand up, then do not sit, unless that is too
    difficult for you. If you sit because it is too difficult to stand, you will still have
    the full reward.
Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari reported that the Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If a person gets sick or travels, he will
    have the same reward as when he was healthy or not travelling.” (Narrated by
    al-Bukhaari, 2834).
    With regard to rukoo’ and sujood, you do not have
    to do them because you are not able to do them, since bowing would cause you harm. You
    should try to lean forward as much as you can for rukoo’ and sujood, making the
    sujood lower than the rukoo’ by nodding or gesturing. The Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Put your forehead on the ground if you can,
    otherwise use nods or gestures, and make your sujood lower than your rukoo’.” Shaykh
    al-Albaani said: this was narrated by al-Tabaraani, al-Bazzaar, Ibn al-Sammaak in his

    “If a person is unable to do rukoo’ or sujood, he should indicate them by nods
    or gestures.” (al-‘Umdah Sharh al-‘Iddah, p. 126)
    If you cannot even nod or gesture, then pray according
    to your situation; your rukoo’ and sujood could be by intention only, when you reach

7529,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7529,Do You Have to Do Ghusl after Manual Stimulation?,"My question is: when is it obligatory for a woman to do Ghusl after being with her husband? More importantly, if they do not have sexual intercourse (penis entering vagina) and he just manually stimulates her, does she have to shower and perform Ghusl in order to fast the next morning?","Ghusl is obligatory on men and women alike in case of ejaculation, even if the two circumcised parts do not meet, whether this happens as a result of manual stimulation or otherwise.","When is Ghusl required?


Can you fast without Ghusl?","Praise be to Allah.When is Ghusl required?
Ghusl is obligatory on men and women alike when one of the two following things happens:

When the two “circumcised parts” meet, which is penetration, i.e. intercourse – even if there is no ejaculation – because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When the two circumcised parts meet and the tip of the penis disappears, Ghusl becomes obligatory, whether ejaculation takes place or not.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud; see Sahih Sunan Abu Dawud, 209)
Ejaculation – even if the two circumcised parts do not meet – whether this happens as a result of manual stimulation or otherwise. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Water is for water” – i.e., Ghusl is required when water (meaning semen or sexual fluid) is emitted.

Can you fast without Ghusl?
With regard to fasting, it is not essential for a person to do Ghusl before Fajr starts in order for his fast to be valid . If one starts a day of fasting whilst Junub (impure as a result of sexual activity) the fast is still valid. (See: 70 issues related to fasting). But one should hasten to do Ghusl so that they can pray Fajr on time.

7535,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7535,How      can we define the qiblah for Muslim students at the University of      California?,"i am the president of muslim student association in california state university at long beach,and by allah help we were able to have a place to pray in the campus,but the problem is that we i asked about the direction of ALQIBLA i have found two differents answer on is southeast which i agree onthe other is north east.i now on big problem because i do not know where to place alqibla in the place we got.i know it does not make any sence but i really do not know waht to do.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly:
Wa ‘alaykum al-salam wa rahmat-Allahi wa barakaatuhu (and upon you be peaceand the mercy and blessings of Allah). We congratulate you and your companions for your efforts in getting a place to pray. We ask Allah to fill it with you and with people who will stand and bow and prostrate there.
 Secondly:
One of the essential parts (pillars) of the prayer is facing the qiblah; this is a must. Whoever knows the direction of the qiblah and can face it, but does not do so, his prayer is invalid and he is a sinner, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid Al-Haraam (at Makkah). And wheresoever you people are, turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction” [al-Baqarah 2:144].
 Unless one has a valid excuse, this is the requirement in fard (obligatory) prayers. With regard to naafil (supererogatory) prayers,it is permissible to face any direction one wishes if one is riding whilst travelling. But if one is able to dismount, then it is not permissible for one who is praying a naafil prayer to face any direction other than the qiblah, when one does not have the excuse of riding whilst travelling.
Thirdly:
Whoever is near the Ka’bah has to face the Ka’bah itself, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid Al-Haram” [al-Baqarah 2:144].
 Hence the rows of worshippers around the Ka’bah are circular; the further away they are, the wider the circle is, and the closer they are, the smaller the circle is. Whoever is inside al-Masjid al-Haraam has to face the Ka’bah itself. Whoever is in Makkah has to face al-Masjid al-Haraam; whoever is outside Makkah has to face Makkah. Facing in that direction is sufficient, because of the hadeeth, “Whatever is between the east and the west is the qiblah.” (Narrated by al-Tirmdihi, 342; Ibn Maajah, 1011).
This reference to the east and the west applies specifically to the people of Madeenah and others for whom the direction of the Qiblah is the same, because the Messenger [an error occurred while processing this directive] (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said this to the people of Madeenah.
 Fourthly:
After looking at the map – which is what you should do – if you look at the map and draw a line between California and Makkah and look at the direction of this line, this will tell you what the direction of the qiblah is.
 (This is according to a fatwa given to us by our shaykh, Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen. The worshipper does not have to pay attention to the curvature of the earth’s surface when determining the qiblah; he can work out the direction of Makkah by a straight line).
 When we look at the map, we find that the direction of the qiblah (from California) is towards the east, with a very slight deviation towards the south which is hardly worth mentioning.
 So your qiblah lies between the north and the south, so if you face east, somewhere between the north and south, that will be OK. There is no need to cause big problems and fitnah among the Muslims concerning this issue which Islam has made easy, when it says that the qiblah is between the east and the west, and the scholars have stated that a slight deviation from the direction of Makkah does not matter. So use whatever means are available to determine the direction of the qiblah. 
The Standing Committee was asked about using astronomical instruments to determine the direction of the Ka’bah, and they replied as follows: 
The Muslim scholars and those who were experienced in navigation could find the direction of the Ka’bah at night by referring to the Pole Star and other stars, and the moon as it rose and set, and during the day by referring to the sun as it rose and set, and by reference to other natural phenomena, before there were any Japanese or European navigational devices and the like. So knowledge of the qiblah is not to be determined solely by use of these tools. But if it is confirmed by trustworthy Muslim experts in this field that a specific device can show the direction of the qiblah precisely or approximately, then there is no shar’i reason why we should not use it; indeed, it may be obligatory to act in accordance with it if a person who wants to pray cannot find any other evidence of the qiblah.

7545,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7545,He has repented from stealing from the kuffaar,"I live in a non-muslim country and for a long time was committing many sins, but, alhamdu_lillah who has guided me to his straight path I have repented. However, before I repented I use to do things such as steal from shops, cheat the government for social security money, take public transport without paying and things of that nature (may Allah forgive me). If I inform the authority of these things I will be imprisoned in non-muslim environment! please tell me what I should do! and please ask Allah to forgive me.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Who has honoured you by enabling you to repent, We ask Allaah to guide us all to the Straight Path and to make us steadfast in following it until death. 
You should note that it is not permissible for the Muslims to cheat anyone and take his money unlawfully, even if he is a kaafir. 
If the Muslim commits any sin, whether stealing or anything else, then repents before the matter is referred to the judge, then he is spared the punishment in that case, and it is not permissible to punish him, because Allaah says concerning banditry (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The recompense of those who wage war against Allaah and His Messenger and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be killed or crucified or their hands and their feet be cut off from opposite sides, or be exiled from the land. That is their disgrace in this world, and a great torment is theirs in the Hereafter.
Except for those who (having fled away and then) came back (as Muslims) with repentance before they fall into your power; in that case, know that Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Maa’idah 5:33-34]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The one who repents from sin is like one who never sinned.” And the one who did not sin cannot be punished. 
Al-Ikhtiyaaraat al-Fiqhiyyah, p. 510-526; al-Mughni, 12/484 
It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, after al-Aslami had been stoned, “Avoid these immoral actions that Allaah has forbidden. Whoever does any of them, let him conceal that which Allaah has concealed, and let him repent to Allaah, for whoever tells us what he has done, we will carry out the ruling mentioned in the Book of Allaah on him.” (Narrated by al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak ‘ala’l-Saheehayn, 4/425; al-Bayhaqi, 8/330. This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Haakim, Ibn al-Sakan and Ibn al-Mulaqqin). 
See al-Talkhees al-Habeer, 4/57; Khalaasat al-Badr al-Muneer, by Ibn al-Mulaqqin, 2/303. 
Based on this, you do not have to go to the authorities and tell them about your stealing, rather it is sufficient for you to repent sincerely. But you have to return the money to its owners, because your repentance is not valid otherwise. You do not have to tell them that this is money that you stole from them, especially if you are afraid that they will put you in prison. What matters is returning the money etc to its owners. So you could put it in an envelope, or give it to someone who will give it to them, etc. 
You must also return the government’s money, and the money of other people. If you do not know exactly how much the money was, then estimate what you think is most likely, i.e., pay until you are sure that you have done what you must do. 
If you do not know who the owners of the money are, then you can give it in charity on their behalf.",Islam Q&A

Bending the finger slightly when pointing","Praise be to Allah.Is it sunnah to move the finger in tashahhud?
It is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to point with his index finger and move it during the tashahhud when praying. 
When to move finger in tashahhud
The scholars differed concerning that and there are several points of view. 

The Hanafis say that the finger should be raised when saying “La (no)” in the phrase “Ash-hadu an la ilaha ill-Allah (I bear witness that there is no god except Allah)” and it should be lowered when saying, “ill-Allah (except Allah).”  
The Shafi’is say that it should be raised when saying “ill-Allah.” 
The Malikis say that it should be moved right and left until one finishes the prayer. 
The Hanbalis say that one should point with the finger when saying the name of Allah, without moving it. 

Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “There is no basis for any of these definitions and manners in the Sunnah. The closest of them to the correct view is the Hanbali view, were it not that they limited raising the finger to when saying the name of Allah.” (Tamam al-Minnah, p. 223) 
Evidence for the permissibility of moving finger in tashahhud
With regard to the evidence concerning this issue: 

‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Zubayr said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sat during the prayer, he would place his left foot between his thigh and calf, and tuck his right foot underneath him, and place his left hand on his left knee, and place his right hand on his right thigh, and point with his finger. (Narrated by Muslim, 579)

In al-Nasai (1270) and Abu Dawud (989) it says: “He used to point with his finger when making du`a but he did not move it.” 
This addition – “but he did not move it” – was classed as da’if by Ibn al-Qayyim in Zad al-Ma’ad, 1/238. It was also classed as weak by al-Albani in Tamam al-Minnah, p. 218. 

Wail ibn Hajar said: I said: I will certainly watch how the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prays. So I watched him and he stood up and said takbir (“Allahu akbar”), and raised his hands until they were level with his ears. Then he placed his right hand on his left hand, wrist and lower forearm. When he wanted to bow, he raised his hands likewise, and put his hands on his knees, and when he raised his head he raised his hands likewise. Then he prostrated and put his hands level with his ears, then he sat with his left foot tucked underneath him and put his left hand on his left thigh and knee, and he put the edge of his right elbow on his right thigh. Then he held two of his fingers and made a circle, then he raised his forefinger and moved it, making du`a with it. (Narrated by al-Nasai, 889; classed as sahih by Ibn Khuzaymah, 1/354; Ibn Majah, 5/170; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Irwa al-Ghalil, 367.) 

Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin quoted this hadith – “moving it, making du`a with it” – as evidence that moving the forefinger during the tashahhud should be done with every phrase of the du`a. He said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’: 
“The Sunnah indicates that he should point with it when making du`a, because the wording of the hadith is “moving it, making du`a with it”. So every time you make du`a, move your finger thus indicating the exalted nature of the One to Whom you are addressing your du`as. So we say: 
“Al-salamu ‘alayka ayyuha’l-Nabiyyu (peace be upon you, O Prophet)” – you should point your finger because this salam is a kind of du`a. “Al-salamu ‘alayna (peace be upon us)” – you should point your finger. “Allahumma salli ‘ala Muhammad (O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad)” – you should point your finger. “Allahumma barik ‘ala Muhammad) O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad)” – you should point your finger. ‘A’idhu Billahi min ‘adhabi jahannam (I seek refuge with Allah from the torment of Hell)” – you should point your finger. “Wa min ‘adhab al-qabr (and from the torment of the grave)” – you should point your finger. “Wa min fitnat il-mahya wal-mamat (and from the trials of life and death)” – you should point your finger.  “Wa min fitnat il-masieh il-dajjal (and from the tribulation of the Dajjal)  – you should point your finger. Every time you make du`a you should point your finger, indicating the greatness of the One to Whom you are making du`a. This is closer to the Sunnah.” 
Looking at the finger when pointing
It is Sunnah when pointing to look at your finger. Al-Nawawi said: 
“The Sunnah is not to let your gaze go beyond the pointing finger. There is a sahih hadith concerning this in Sunan Abi Dawud. You should point in the direction of the qiblah and intend when pointing to affirm the Oneness of Allah and exclusive devotion to Him.” (Sharh Muslim, 5/81) 
The hadith to which al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) referred is the hadith of ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Zubayr quoted above. The version narrated by Abu Dawud is (989): “And he should not let his gaze go beyond his pointing finger.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud) 
Pointing with the finger towards the qiblah
It is Sunnah to point with it towards the qiblah. ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar narrated that he saw a man moving pebbles with his hand whilst he was praying. When he finished, ‘Abd-Allah said to him: “Do not move pebbles whilst you are praying, for that comes from the Shaytan. Rather do what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do. He put his right hand on his thigh and pointed with the finger that is next to the thumb towards the qiblah, and he fixed his gaze on it.” Then he said: “This is what I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) doing.” (Narrated by al-Nasai, 1160; Ibn Khuzaymah, 1/355; Ibn Hibban, 5/273. classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Nasai)
Bending the finger slightly when pointing 
Bending the finger slightly when pointing was mentioned in the hadith of Numayr al-Khuza’i, (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 991, and al-Nasai, 1275) But this is a weak hadith. (See Tamam al-Minnah by al-Albani p. 222)

7571,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7571,Suggestions as how to end the estrangement between disputing relatives,My Uncle has told my mother that he doesn't want to see our family ever again. What is our duty in  this position considering we did nothing to upset him or his family?,,,"Praise be to Allah.You have to look for the reason, for it is not normal
      for something like this to happen without a reason, but that reason may be
      unknown to you. If you did not do anything deliberate to upset him, then
      do not feel responsible for what has happened and for his cutting off ties
      with you. You have to be patient and treat him well even if he mistreats
      you. Perhaps he will come back to you when he sees your good attitude.
 In
      many cases, this kind of rigid and harsh-hearted attitude is temporary and
      does not last for long; it may stem from a particular incident which made
      the person angry, but when his anger has calmed down and some time has
      passed, things go back to the way they were, or close enough. Perhaps some
      extreme circumstances coincided with a bad attitude, hatred or an
      inclination to bear grudges, which resulted in a long-term estrangement.
      In this case all parties concerned should be given time to calm down
      gradually, so that the bad feelings may be reduced; at the same time, the
      person who has cut off ties of kinship should be reminded of the rights of
      his relatives, what Allaah and His Messenger say on this matter, and the
      stern warning issued to those who cut off ties of kinship. If any of the
      parties involved have been wronged, things must be put right as quickly as
      possible, and there is nothing wrong with tryingto heal the wounded pride of theparty that has been wronged, by apologizing or getting together for
      the purpose of reconciliation, etc., as Allaah says (interpretation of the
      meaning):
“and
      adjust all matters of difference among you” [al-Anfaal 8:1].
We hope that
      the one who undertakes to reconcile between them will earn the reward
      mentioned in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning);
“There is
      no good in most of their secret talks save (in) him who orders Sadaqah
      (charity in Allaah’s Cause), or Ma‘roof (Islamic Monotheism and all
      the good and righteous deeds which
      Allaah has ordained), or conciliation between mankind; and he who does
      this, seeking the good Pleasure of Allaah, We shall give him a great
      reward” [al-Nisaa’ 4:114]
 Sometimes
      it may be better to avoid getting involved in looking for a reconciliation
      until things have calmed down and people are more likely to agree to open
      the issue and listen to those who want to reconcile between them and
      accept their suggestions.

7577,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7577,The wife’s    family want to do forbidden things during the wedding party,"I'm getting married soon and my future wife and her family want an expensive wedding with haram stuff such as music, mixing of the sexes etc. What should I do? Should I call the wedding off and marry someone else?",,,"Praise be to Allah.What the girls family wants to do is undoubtedly haraam and is unacceptable. It is not permissible to please people by doing something that angers Allaah. We do not advise you at all to start your married life with haraam actions. The Muslim should disassociate himself and his family from the idea that his wife is a cheap product to be looked at by all and sundry when she is wearing all her make-up and jewellery etc.
We advise you to deal with the situation by doing the following:


You should advise them, politely, and explain to them the Islamic ruling concerning what they are planning to do. Warn them of the wrath of Allaah, and explain to them that music and mixing are haraam. Tell them that they could still have a successful wedding without these haraam things, and it is not in their interests at all in this world or in the Hereafter to respond to the blessing of Allaah, i.e., their daughters marriage, by disobeying Him and going against His commands and doing things that anger Him.


If that does not work, look for some wise people among their family and relatives, and from your own family too, who they think highly of and who you hope can help. Perhaps Allaah will decree that you will find a way out through them, and they will give up these evil things even if it is through pressure and embarrassment.


If that does not work, look for intervention on the part of someone who is knowledgeable and wise, whom they respect and look up to. Perhaps he will make them feel ashamed, or will be able to convince them that what they want to do is wrong, so they will give it up.


If none of this works, perhaps you can threaten them with divorce or separation. They might pay attention to that, because it would make them look bad in front of other people, so they will give up that which has been forbidden by Allaah. Perhaps leaving a long time between the nikaah (marriage contract) and the wedding party will have the result of convincing these people.
If they do not respond at all, then we would seriously warn you against getting involved with these people. But if the girl is religious and good-mannered, and she does not agree with what her family are doing, and you and she are able not to be present when the haraam things are happening, and you can leave the party when they start doing things that anger Allaah, and also announce your objections and state that you are disassociating yourselves from what is going to happen, (this is fine). Remember the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): then sit not with them (but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them [al-Nisaa 4:140]. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it

7578,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7578,Can a person who is Muslim in name only be given any part of the inheritance?,"Is it obligatory for a muslim to follow the inheritence laws in the Quran?

 What if some of our family members are Kuffar ( muslims who dont pray, fast etc). 

I've heard people say that the inheritence laws in the Quran should only be applied when all family members follow them. Is this true?",,,"Praise be to Allah.No part of the religion of Allaah may be forsaken because of differences in
      time, place or circumstances, whether it be the laws of inheritance or
      anything else. These rulings apply in all times and in every place, for
      Arabs and non-Arabs, male and female, rich and poor, nomads or
      city-dwellers; all of them are equal in this regard. When Allaah mentioned
      the laws of inheritance in Soorat al-Nisaa’, He said at the end of the
      aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“(these
      fixed shares) are ordained by Allaah. And Allaah is Ever All Knower, All
      Wise” [al-Nisaa’ 4:11]
 Imaam Ibn
      Katheer said in his commentary on this aayah: this is an obligation which
      Allaah has enjoined and decreed. Allaah is All-Knowing and All-Wise, Who
      puts things in their places and gives each person what he deserves
      according to his own situation. “And
      Allaah is Ever All‑Knower, All‑Wise” [al-Nisaa’ 4:11].
      (al-Tafseer, 1/500).
 Then
      Allaah says, concerning the rulings and amounts of inheritance
      (interpretation of the meaning):
“These
      are the limits (set by) Allaah (or ordainments as regards laws of
      inheritance), and whosoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger (Muhammad) will
      be admitted to Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise), to abide
      therein, and that will be the great success.And whosoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger (Muhammad), and
      transgresses His limits, He will cast him into the Fire, to abide therein;
      and he shall have a disgraceful torment} [al-Nisaa’ 4:13-14]
In
      this aayah, Allaah states that not implementing the shar’i rules on
      inheritance is a transgression of the limits set by Allaah, and that the
      person who does this will abide in Hell forever and will suffer a
      disgraceful torment.
You
      must realize – may Allaah bless you – that knowledge of the
      inheritance laws is half of knowledge, as some of the scholars said. Ibn
      Katheer said: Ibn ‘Uyaynah said: the inheritance laws have been called
      half of knowledge because all people go through this. (al-Tafseer,
      2/497).
Secondly:
If you
      believe that the person who does not pray is a kaafir and apostate –
      which is the correct view, and Allaah knows best – it is not permissible
      for a kaafir to inherit anything from a Muslim’s wealth, or for a Muslim
      to inherit anything from a kaafir’s wealth.
It
      was reported from Usaamah ibn Zayd (may Allaah be pleased with him) that
      the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A
      Muslim does not inherit from a kaafir and a kaafir does not inherit from a
      Muslim.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6383; Muslim, 1614).
Based
      on the above, those who do not pray cannot inherit anything from those who
      pray regularly, and those who pray regularly cannot inherit anything from
      those who do not pray.
Thirdly:
You should
      find out whether this person who does not pray has forsaken prayer
      altogether, or if he prays some of the obligatory prayers and neglects
      others. If the latter is the case, then he is not a kaafir, because the
      kaafir is the person who does not pray at all.
Fourthly:
From
      the above it will be clear that upholding the limits set by Allaah with
      regard to inheritance is obligatory in all cases, whether all the family
      members accept this ruling or only some of them do so, because the ruling
      of Allaah is fixed and definite. At the same time we should note that
      everyone who does not accept the ruling of Allaah is a kaafir who cannot
      inherit from his Muslim relative and his Muslim relative cannot inherit
      from him, if he dies when he still rejects the ruling of Allaah and is     still a kaafir. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

If the problem can be solved by storing the picture (in .jpg format, then sending it via the Internet, so the picture is not permanent), then this is permitted according to some scholars.
