When it is Ramadan, is it permissible for a person to break his fast if he feels intensely thirsty while treating the injured?","It is permissible for civil defense workers to break their fast in extreme heat in order to rescue the injured, but it is preferable not to break the fast, except in cases of necessity, and they should make up that day.",,"Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for civil defense workers to break their fast in extreme heat in order to rescue the injured, but it is preferable not to break the fast, except in cases of necessity , and they should make up that day. 
So long as a person is able to complete his fast, it is not permissible for him to break it. But if an accident happens far away, for example, and the sun is burning down in the summertime, and you go there to rescue the injured or put out a fire, and you feel thirsty and are afraid that your thirst will affect you adversely, then in sha Allah it is OK to break your fast. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.” [al-Taghabun 64:16]
“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.” [al-Baqarah 2:286]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“If I command you to do a thing, do as much of it as you can.” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 1337; al-Nasai, 5/110)
This applies so long as no travel is involved; if the matter involves travelling , then it is unconditionally permitted to break the fast.

If a woman tries to stop this cycle, it will undoubtedly have a harmful effect on her body, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm.” This is besides the fact that these pills can do harm to the uterus as the doctors have stated. What I think with regard to this issue is that women should not use these pills. Praise be to Allaah for His decree and wisdom.

If she becomes pure a second time, should she fast and pray, or not?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If a woman’s nifaas stops before the forty days (after the birth) are over, she has to do ghusl and pray and fast Ramadaan, and it is permissible for her husband to have intercourse with her. If the bleeding resumes within the forty days (after the birth), then she has to stop praying and fasting, and it is forbidden for her husband to have intercourse with her, according to the more correct of the two scholarly views. She comes under the rulings on women in nifaas until either the nifaas stops or the forty days are over. If her nifaas stops before or on the fortieth day (after the birth), then she should do ghusl and start praying and fasting, and it is permissible for her husband to have intercourse with her. If the bleeding continues after the fortieth day (after the birth), then this is irregular bleeding and she should not stop praying and fasting because of it, rather she should pray and fast during Ramadaan, and it is permissible for her husband to have intercourse with her – as is the case with a woman with istihaadah (irregular, non-menstrual bleeding). She has to wash herself with water every time she uses the toilet, and use cotton pads etc. to absorb the bleeding, and she has to do wudoo’ for each and every prayer, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told women with istihaadah to do these things.

      there are events called “Multiplication Festival” or “Division

      Arabic. These events may last for a day, or three days, or a week, during
      which the topic in question is discussed and explored. Some Islamic
      schools want to use this idea for Islamic purposes, so they might say for
      example, “Festival of Sincerity” so that for three days all topics on
      the radio and in the classrooms will deal with sincerity. They could also
      do “Festivals” on the topics of prayer or wudoo’, without specifying

Question:

Answer:
(Yes), so that it does not become like an Eid or festival.
See Questions # 1130 
  and 3325. 

If we Muslims hold events like 
  this we should be careful to avoid using the word Mahrajaan so that people will 
  not confuse them with the festivals of the Mushrikeen, even in name.
Mahrajaan is one of the festivals of the Majoos (Zoroastrians) 
  and kuffaar who worship fire. The word Mahrajaan is composed of “mahar” meaning 
  loyalty and “jaan” meaning power, so the whole word means, the power of loyalty. 
  The origin of this festival is the celebration of the victory of the king Afridoon. 
  It was also said that it was a celebration of the onset of the moderate weather 
  of autumn. It could be that what we mentioned above (the king’s victory) coincided 
  with the onset of the moderate weather of autumn and they continued to celebrate 
  it. It is celebrated on October 26 in the ancient Syriac calendar. The festival 
  lasts for six days, and the sixth day is al-Mahrajaan al-Kabeer (the Great Mahrajaan). 
  On this date and on Nawrooz (Persian New Year) they used to exchange gifts of 
  musk, amber, al-’ood al-hindi (a kind of perfume or incense), saffron and camphor. 
  The Rightly-Guided Khaleefah ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez (may Allaah have mercy 
  on him) abolished this festival when some of the Muslims celebrated it.
One of the problems affecting the Muslims nowadays is the use 
  of the word Mahrajaan to describe many economic, cultural and social gatherings, 
  celebrations and events, even those that are held for the purposes of da’wah. 
  They call their events things like “Mahrajaan al-Thaqaafah (cultural festival”, 
  “Mahrajaan al-Tasawwuq (shopping festival)”, Mahrajaan al-Kutub (book festival), 
  Mahrajaan al-Da’wah (daw’ah festival). We see so many advertisements and hear 
  many expressions starting with this idolatrous expression Mahrajaan which is 
  the festival of the fire-worshippers.

People go there to bathe and for healing, and they bring with them animals to slaughter when they get there. What is the ruling on slaughtering animals like this?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If the waters have been tried and tested, and they are 
          beneficial in the case of some diseases, then there is nothing wrong 
          with that, because Allaah has created some benefits for some sicknesses 
          in some waters. If it is known from experience that these waters ate 
          beneficial for those who are suffering from certain diseases, such as 
          rheumatism, etc., there is nothing wrong with that. 
 With regard to slaughtering animals, this comes under 
          various categories:  
If the animals are slaughtered to meet the people’s need 
          for food, etc., or to feed any guests that come to them, there is nothing 
          wrong with that. If they are slaughtered for any other purpose, such 
          as to draw closer to the water or the jinn or the Prophets, or on the 
          basis of some false belief, then that is not permissible, because Allaah 
          says, addressing His Prophet  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): 
          
“Say 
          (O Muhammad): ‘Verily, my Salaah (prayer), my sacrifice, my living, 
          and my dying are for Allaah, the Lord of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinn 
          and all that exists). 
He has no partner. And of this 
          I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims’” [al-An’aam 
          6:162-163] 
 “Verily, 
          We have granted you (O Muhammad) al-Kawthar (a river in Paradise); 
Therefor turn in prayer to your 
          Lord and sacrifice (to Him only)” 
[al-Kawthar :1-2] 
So 
          animals should be slaughtered only for Allaah and sacrifices should 
          be offered only to Allaah. The same applies to all other acts of worship 
          – they should be dedicated only to Allaah alone. It is not permissible 
          to do any of these things for anything other than Allaah, because Allaah 
          says (interpretation of the meanings): 
 “And they were 
          commanded not, but that they should worship Allaah, and worship none 
          but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him)…” [al-Bayyinah 
          :5] 
 “So 
          worship Allaah (Alone) by doing religious deeds sincerely for Allaah’s 
          sake only. 
Surely, the religion (i.e. the 
          worship and the obedience) is for Allaah only” [al-Zumar 
          39:2-3] 
and because of the aayaat 
          quoted above and other similar verses. And the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah has cursed 
          those who offer sacrifices to anyone other than Allaah” (narrated by 
          Muslim in his Saheeh, 
          from the hadeeth of ‘Ali, may Allaah be pleased with him).
 So no one is allowed to offer sacrifices to the jinn 
          or to a certain star or planet, or to certain waters, or to a certain 
          Prophet, or to any person, or to idols. Worship is only for Allaah, 
          and we should seek to draw closer to Him alone through sacrifices and 
          prayers, and all other kinds of worship, because Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning):   
“You 
          (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything)” 
          [al-Faatihah 
          1:5] 
 and because of the verses quoted above (interpretation 
          of the meanings); 
“And they were 
          commanded not, but that they should worship Allaah, and worship none 
          but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him)…” al-Bayyinah

 “So

          worship and the obedience) is for Allaah only” [al-Zumar 
          39:2-3] 
and other aayaat. 
Sacrifice is one of the most important and one of the best 
          acts of worship, so it must be done sincerely for Allaah Alone, because 
          of the aayaat that we have mentioned, and because the Prophet

Punishment for not wearing hijab


Useful tips","Praise be to Allah.Importance of following the commands of Allah and His Messenger
First of all it is essential to know that Muslim men and Muslim women are obliged to follow the commands of Allah and His Messenger, no matter how difficult that may be for people and without feeling shy of other people.
The believer who is sincere in his faith is the one who is sincere in carrying out his duty towards his Lord and obeying His commands and avoiding that which He has forbidden. No believer, man or woman, has the right to hesitate or delay with regard to commands; rather he or she should hear and obey immediately, in accordance with words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning):
“It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision.” [al-Ahzab 33:36]  
This is the case with the believers who are praised by their Lord in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):
“The only saying of the faithful believers, when they are called to Allah (His Words, the Quran) and His Messenger, to judge between them, is that they say: “We hear and we obey.” And such are the successful (who will live forever in Paradise).
And whosoever obeys Allah and His Messenger , fears Allah, and keeps his duty (to Him), such are the successful.” [al-Nur 24:51-52]  
Look at the greatness and might of the One Whom you are disobeying
Moreover, the Muslim should not look at how small or great the sin is, rather he should look at the greatness and might of the One Whom he is disobeying, for He is the Most Great, the Most High; He is Mighty in strength and Severe in punishment, and His punishment is severe and painful and humiliating. If He exacts vengeance on those who disobey Him, then utter destruction will be their fate. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Such is the Seizure of your Lord when He seizes the (population of) towns while they are doing wrong. Verily, His Seizure is painful (and) severe.
Indeed in that (there) is a sure lesson for those who fear the torment of the Hereafter. That is a Day whereon mankind will be gathered together, and that is a Day when all (the dwellers of the heavens and the earth) will be present.” [Hud 11:102-103]
 A sin may appear insignificant in the eyes of a person when before Allah it is serious, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“…you counted it a little thing, while with Allah it was very great.” [al-Nur 24:15]  
This matter is as some of the scholars said: 
“Do not look at the smallness of the sin, rather look at the One Whom you are disobeying.” 
We have to obey Allah and do as He commands. We must remember that He is watching in secret and in public, and avoid that which He has forbidden.  
With regard to belief, if a Muslim who prays commits some sins or bad deeds, he is still a Muslim so long as he does not commit any action which would put him beyond the pale of Islam or do any of the things which nullify Islam. This sinful Muslim will be subject to the will of Allah in the Hereafter; if He wills He will punish him, and if He wills He will forgive him. If he enters Hell in the Hereafter, he will not abide there forever. But no person can be certain as to his fate, as to whether the punishment will befall him or not, because this matter is known only to Allah.  
Categories of sins
Sins are divided into two categories, minor and major. 

Minor sins may be expiated for by prayer, fasting and righteous deeds. 
Major sins (which are those concerning which a specific warning has been narrated, or for which there is a specific hadd punishment in this world or torment in the Hereafter) cannot be expiated for by righteous deeds. Rather the one who commits such sins has to repent sincerely from them. Whoever repents, Allah will accept his repentance. There are many kinds of major sins such as lying, zina, riba (usury/interest), stealing, not wearing hijab at all, and so on.  

Punishment for not wearing hijab
Based on the above, we cannot say for certain whether a woman who does not wear hijab will enter Hell, but she deserves the punishment of Allah because she has disobeyed His command to her. 
With regard to her specific fate, Allah knows best what it will be. We cannot speak about things of which we have no knowledge, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And follow not (O man, i.e., say not, or do not, or witness not) that of which you have no knowledge. Verily, the hearing, and the sight, and the heart of each of those ones will be questioned (by Allah).” [Al-Isra 17:36]
It is sufficient deterrent for the Muslim whose heart is aware to know that if he does a certain action he will be exposed to the punishment of his Lord, because His punishment is severe and painful, and His Fire is hot indeed.  
“The Fire of Allah, kindled which leaps up over the hearts.” [Al-Humazah 104:6-7]  
On the other hand, for the woman who obeys her Lord’s commands – including observing complete hijab – we hope that she will enter Paradise and attain the victory of salvation from the Fire and its torments. 
Useful tips 
It is strange indeed that a woman whose character is good, and who prays and fasts and does not look at boys, and avoids gossip and backbiting, does not wear hijab . If a person really achieves these righteous deeds, this is a strong indication that she loves goodness and hates evil. Let us not forget that prayer prevents immorality and evil, and that good deeds bring more of the same. Whoever fears Allah concerning his nafs, Allah will support him and help him against his nafs. 
It seems that there is much goodness in this Muslim woman, and she is close to the path of righteousness. So she should strive to wear hijab as her Lord has commanded her. She should ignore the specious arguments and resist the pressures of her family. 
She should not listen to the words of those who criticize her, and she should ignore the specious arguments of those sinful women who want to make a display of themselves according to fashion, and she should resist the desires of her own self which may tempt her to show off her beauty and feel proud of it. 
She should adhere to that which will afford her protection and modesty, and rise above being a mere commodity to be enjoyed by every evil person who comes and goes. She should refuse to be a source of temptation to the slaves of Allah. We appeal to her faith and her love for Allah and His Messenger, and we urge her  to  observe the hijab enjoined by Allah and to obey the commands of Allah (interpretation if the meanings):  
“and not to show off their adornment.” [al-Nur 24:31]
“and do not display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance, and perform As Salah (Iqamat as Salah), and give Zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger.” [al-Ahzab 33:33]

In His wisdom, He decreed that Adam (peace be upon him) should be the father of mankind, and His wisdom, mercy and justice decreed that from among Adam’s progeny He should select an elite of Messengers and Prophets – may peace and blessings be upon them and upon our Prophet. Among those whom He chose and preferred over others were the Messengers of strong will [Uloo’l-‘Azm, see al-Ahqaaf 46:35], namely, Muhammad, Ibraaheem, Nooh, Moosa and ‘Eesaa ibn Maryam, may the best of blessings and peace be upon them. And He chose and favoured above them all their leader, the final Messenger, our Prophet Muhammad ibn ‘Abd-Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He is indeed the leader of the sons of Adam, with no boast. He will carry the banner and will be granted the power of intercession [on the Day of Resurrection]. He is the one who will attain al-maqaam al-mahmood (the Praised Position) in Paradise, which will be given to one person only, and that person will be our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Hence Allah took the covenant and pledge from all the Prophets that if Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sent during the lifetime of any one of them, they would be obliged to follow him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), to leave behind what they had brought and follow what our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) brought. As Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And (remember) when Allah took the Covenant of the Prophets, saying: ‘Take whatever I gave you from the Book and Hikmah (understanding of the Laws of Allah), and afterwards there will come to you a Messenger (Muhammad) confirming what is with you; you must, then, believe in him and help him.’ Allah said: ‘Do you agree (to it) and will you take up My Covenant (which I conclude with you)?’ They said: ‘We agree.’ He said: ‘Then bear witness; and I am with you among the witnesses (for this).’ Then whoever turns away after this, they are the Faasiqoon (rebellious: those who turn away from Allah’s obedience)” [Aal-Imraan 3:81-82]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him): “By Allah, if my brother Moosa were alive, he would have nochoice but to follow me.”
And when the Messiah ‘Eesaa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him) comes down at the end of time, he will come to rule in accordance with the sharee’ah (religious laws)of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he will follow him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
All of the above refers to their status before Allah. With regard to their religion, it is one religion, for they all called people to believe in One God, Allah (Tawheed) and to devote worship sincerely to Him Alone. With regard to laws, each of them had his own law which was for his people alone. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“To each among you, We have prescribed a law and a clear way” [al-Maa’idah 5:48]. But the way (sharee’ah) of our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the most perfect, the best, the most complete and the most beloved to Allah; it abrogates all laws that came before it. Undoubtedly the Prophets differ in status, and they are at varying levels. The best of them, as stated above, are the five Messengers of strong will (Uloo’l-‘Azm), and the best of them all is the Seal of the Prophets, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
With regard to the saheeh ahaadeeth (authentic prophetic narrations), “Do not prefer me over Yoonus ibn Mattaa” and “By the One Who chose Moosa over all of creation” – these all indicate the immense humility of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when speaking of his brothers the Messengers. But he is undoubtedly the best of them all, for he led them in prayer in Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) on the night of the Israa’ (Night Journey). He will be the leader of the sons of Adam on the Day of Resurrection, and he is the only one among all the Messengers who will be granted the power of intercession on that Day. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the one who said: “From among the sons of Adam, Allah chose Quraysh; from among Quraysh He chose Kinaanah; from among Kinaanah He chose Bani Haashim; and from among Bani Haashim He chose me.” He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the Chosen One (al-Mustafaa) from among all of mankind.

7461,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7461,Ruling on booty from the wars which Muslims are fighting,"In a situation where the muslims are engaged in jihad against an agressor like in bosnia. when the mujahideen are fighting they sometimes capture land and booty: Money, arms, etc..
Islamically speaking it is haram in islam to steal. but is this theft? If it is not then...
1) how must the money be used?
2) who can use it?
3) does it have to be distributed? to who?
4) what is ment by a fifth?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah has prescribed jihaad for His sake for great purposes and reasons, such as spreading this religion, telling people about it and about the purpose for which Allaah created them. Other purposes of jihaad include repulsing the aggression of the enemies of this religion, who fight it in order to extinguish its light and are trying to eliminate it and its followers. The basic evidence for this is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“Permission to fight (against disbelievers) is given to those (believers) who are fought against, because they have been wronged; and surely, Allaah is Able to give them (believers) victory Those who have been expelled from their homes unjustly only because they said: Our Lord is Allaah.’” [al-Hajj 22:40]
What is happening in Bosnia, Kosovo, Chechnya and other parts of the Muslim world is that which Allaah has told us about concerning the kuffaar (interpretation of the meaning):
“They wish that you reject Faith, as they have rejected (Faith), and thus that you all become equal (like one another).” [al-Nisaa’ 4:89]
“and they desire that you should disbelieve” [al-Mumtahanah 60:2]
“Many of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) wish that if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed, out of envy from their ownselves, even after the truth has become manifest unto them” [al-Baqarah 2:109]
“Never will the Jews nor the Christians be pleased with you (O Muhammad) till you follow their religion” [al-Baqarah 2:120].
So the fighting that is taking place between the Muslims and the kuffaar is the checking of one set of people by means of another, which is part of the laws of the universe created by Allaah, which Allaah mentioned when He said (interpretation of the meaning):
“So they routed them by Allaah’s Leave and Dawood (David) killed Jaaloot (Goliath), and Allaah gave him [Dawood (David)] the kingdom [after the death of Taloot (Saul) and Samuel] and Al-Hikmah (Prophethood), and taught him of that which He willed. And if Allaah did not check one set of people by means of another, the earth would indeed be full of mischief. But Allaah is full of bounty to the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists)” [al-Baqarah 2:251]
“Those who have been expelled from their homes unjustly only because they said: “Our Lord is Allaah.” For had it not been that Allaah checks one set of people by means of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, wherein the Name of Allaah is mentioned much would surely, have been pulled down. Verily, Allaah will help those who help His (Cause). Truly, Allaah is All Strong, All‑Mighty” [al-Hajj 22:40]
The Muslims’ fighting nowadays against their enemies among the Serbs, Russians and other kuffaar is no more than the repulsion of aggression, hostility and injustice. It is the kind of jihaad aimed at checking people which is prescribed in Islam, and thus is subject to the Islamic rulings on jihaad. Whatever the Muslims take in these wars – whether it is wealth, weapons, equipment, property, or whatever – in general belongs to the Muslims and it is halaal for them, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“So enjoy what you have gotten of booty in war, lawful and good’ [al-Anfaal 8:69]. What is meant here by booty (ghaneemah) is wealth in the form of money, property and other useful things which the Mujaahideen who are fighting for the sake of Allaah have taken in their battles with the kuffaar. This is not a kind of stealing at all, for a number of reasons:
1.Stealing means taking property by stealth and unlawfully from its proper place. This is something completely different, for the wealth of jihaad, the spoils of war and the booty, are taken from the kuffaar by right. We are given permission to do so by sharee’ah and it is allowed for us to do this as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “So enjoy what you have gotten of booty in war, lawful and good” [al-Anfaal 8:69].. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do this in his wars and his jihaad against the kuffaar, when he confiscated their property and wealth.
2.Stealing applies in the case of property which is protected and is sacrosanct, but the property of the kuffaar who are waging war against Islam is not protected or sacrosanct.
The least that we can say is that this (taking booty) is a means of responding in kind, because the Muslims there have had their wealth taken from them, their rights have been denied and their homes have been confiscated. So this is a means of restoring their rights and giving back that which has been taken from them. It is in the nature of restitution of their rights. For Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And indeed whosoever takes revenge after he has suffered wrong, for such there is no way (of blame) against them” – i.e., blaming them or declaring them to be sinners – “The way (of blame) is only against those who oppress men and rebel in the earth without justification” [al-Shooraa 42:41-42]
Once this is understood, then all the property which the mujaahideen gain during their wars with the kuffaar is called ghaneemah (booty) or fay’ (spoils of war) in sharee’ah. The difference between them is that the former is that which is taken by fighting, and the latter is that which is taken without fighting, i.e., what is left behind by the kuffaar when they are routed or when they surrender without a battle or any military action. With regard to ghaneemah (booty), it is obligatory according to sharee’ah for the imaam (leader) or the commander of the mujaahideen or the one who is responsible for them or in charge of them, to gather the booty and divide it into five equal parts, one of which is to be distributed to the groups mentioned by Allaah in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“And know that whatever of war-booty that you may gain, verily, one-fifth (1/5th) of it is assigned to Allaah, and to the Messenger, and to the near relatives [of the Messenger (Muhammad)], (and also) the orphans, Al‑Masaakin (the poor) and the wayfarer” [al-Anfaal 8:41]
The other four-fifths are to be shared out among the mujaahideen who took part in the fighting, by giving one share to each foot-soldier and three shares to each horseman (one share for him and two for his horse – this is if horses were used in the fighting). This wealth is permissible and good for the Muslim army, and has been allowed for them by Allaah, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “So enjoy what you have gotten of booty in war, lawful and good’ [al-Anfaal 8:69].
What is meant by al-khums (the one-fifth), is what referred to in the aayah [al-Anfaal 8:41] and this is this first share to be distributed. The way it is to be distributed is as follows:
1.A share for Allaah and His Messenger, which is to be used to serve the common interest of the Muslims, not for any specific person(s). Allaah has stated that this is for Him and for His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Allaah and His Messenger have no need of it, therefore we know that it is for the slaves of Allaah. The fact that Allaah did not state that it was for anyone in particular indicates that it should be spent to serve the common interests of all. (Tafseer Ibn Sa’di, 3/169)
2.A share for the relatives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) from Bani Haashim and Bani al-Muttalib. They are all equally entitled to it, rich and poor, male and female.
3.Orphans – those who have lost their fathers whilst they are still young i.e., before the age of puberty.
4.The poor and needy.
5.The wayfarer, i.e. travellers who are cut off and need money in order to get back home.
 Some Mufassireen said that the khums (one-fifth) of the war booty should not be given to anyone outside of these categories, and that it need not be shared out equally between these groups, but should be distributed in the manner that best suits the current circumstances. This was the view regarded as most correct by Ibn Sa’di, may Allaah have mercy on him.

7480,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7480,"When    someone dies under the age of 40, will he go to Paradise?","I have discovered something about Islam that I didnt know before. If somebody dies before the age of 40 and was a righteous person let alone he was also a polythiest, is there a chance of him going to paradise? I heard that one can be forgiven of his unislamic faith if he/she dies before the age of responsibility (40). For example, JFK jr
died at 38, if he was a humble man, would he likely enter paradise? I would really appreciate a reply. Salam.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This idea is not correct at all. From the time that Islam emerged, with the mission of the Seal of the Prophets, our Prophet Muhammad ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib al-Qurashi al-Haashimi, a Messenger to all of mankind and the jinn, all other paths to Paradise were shut off, apart from his path, (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Whoever dies calling on any god besides Allaah, whether it is an idol, an angel who is close to Allaah, a Prophet who was sent, a rock, a tree, a grave, a jinn, a tomb of a “saint”, or any of the members of the Prophet’s household (“Ahl al-Bayt”), or anyone else, no matter who it is – if proof (of his misguidance) is established but he still persists, he will be one of the people of Hell, there to dwell for eternity without end; he will never enter Paradise at all.
There are the texts of the Qur’aan and Sunnah which explain this matter; these texts and reports are mutawaatir [i.e., narrated by so many people from so many people that it is inconceivable that such a great number of people could all have agreed upon a lie]. Allaah tells us that He will not accept any religion from anybody except the religion of Islam with which He sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:85]
“This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion” [al-Maa’idah 5:3]
“Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills; and whoever sets up partners with Allaah in worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous sin” [al-Nisaa’ 4:48]
“Verily, Allaah forgives not (the sin of) setting up partners (in worship) with Him, but He forgives whom He wills, sins other than that, and whoever sets up partners in worship with Allaah, has indeed strayed far away” [al-Nisaa’ 4:116]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, no Jew or Christian will hear of me then not believe in that with which I have been sent, but he will be one of the people of the Fire.”
Allaah has warned the Kuffaar of an eternity in Hell in a number of aayaat in His Book. In Soorat al-Nisaa’ He said (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, those who disbelieve and did wrong; Allaah will not forgive them, nor will He guide them to any way Except the way of Hell, to dwell therein forever; and this is ever easy for Allaah” [al-Nisaa’ 4:168-169].
And Allaah says in Soorat al-Ahzaab (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, Allaah has cursed the disbelievers, and has prepared for them a flaming Fire (Hell). Wherein they will abide for ever” [al-Ahzaab 33:64-65]
And Allaah says in Soorat al-Jinn (interpretation of the meaning):
“and whosoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger, then verily, for him is the fire of Hell, he shall dwell therein forever” [al-Jinn 72:23]
And Allaah says, describing the state of the mushrikeen in Hell (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allaah, then Allaah has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers) there are no helpers” [al-Maa’idah 5:72]
And Allaah sent His Messengers and revealed His Books with only one message: that there is only One God (Tawheed) and that mankind should worship Him Alone, with no partner or associate. This is obligatory on man: to believe in this in word and thought and deed, for He is the Only One Who is deserving of worship. This is what is referred to in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“That is because Allaah, He is the Truth, and that which they invoke besides Him is Al-Baatil (falsehood, Satan and all other false deities)” [Liqmaan 31:30].
The aayaat of the Qur’aan repeat and reinforce this message, for example (interpretation of the meanings):
“Worship Allaah and join none with Him (in worship)” [al-Nisaa’ 4:36]
“And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allaah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him)” [al-Bayyinah 98:5]
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘I am only a man like you. It has been revealed to me that your Ilaah (God) is One Ilaah (God ¾ i.e. Allaah). So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.’” [al-Kahf 18:110]
The Messengers all brought the same Message, repeating this call. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad) but We revealed to him (saying): Laa ilaaha illa Ana [none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allaah)], so worship Me (Alone and none else).” (al-Anbiyaa’ 21:25]
Hence the Kufr of the Arabs intensified when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to them calling them to believe in Allaah Alone and worship Him Alone, and to give up and abandon all false gods, intercessors and partners, and to reject all of them. Allaah tells us about them (interpretation of the meaning):
“Truly, when it was said to them: ‘Laa ilaaha illAllaah (none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah),’ they puffed themselves up with pride (i.e. denied it). And (they) said: ‘Are we going to abandon our aalihah (gods) for the sake of a mad poet?’ Nay! he (Muhammad) has come with the truth and he confirms the Messengers.” [al-Saaffaat 37:35-37].
Allaah tells us that everyone who worships or calls upon any other god apart from Allaah will be gathered together with him in the Fire of Hell, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Certainly you (disbelievers) and that which you are worshipping now besides Allaah, are (but) fuel for Hell! (Surely) you will enter it. Had these (idols) been aalihah (gods), they would not have entered there (Hell), and all of them will abide therein. Therein they will be breathing out with deep sighs and roaring and therein they will hear not.” [al-Anbiyaa’ 21:98-100]
To sum up, the person who dies after reaching the age of puberty and is a mushrik who disbelieves in Allaah and calls upon another god apart from Allaah and believes that these other gods can benefit or harm him, or that they have any power at all, is a kaafir and is one of the people of Hell who will dwell therein for eternity, whether he was under or over the age of 40. What counts in Islam is reaching the age of puberty, nothing else. Puberty is reached when one of three signs occurs in males, to which a fourth sign is added in the case of females. These three signs are as follows:


Reaching the age of fifteen years.


Growth of hair in the pubic area (private parts) – for both men and women.


Emission of maniy [sexual fluid] accompanied by feelings of desire, whether in a wet dream, during intercourse or through any other means.


In the case of women there is a fourth sign, which is the onset of menstrual bleeding.
If any of these signs appear, the person is judged to have reached puberty, so he becomes a responsible adult, required to obey all commandments and heed all prohibitions. This does not mean that a child or a person who has not reached puberty is permitted to associate others in worship with Allaah or to call upon anyone other than Him. If he does that, he is counted as a kaafir, but if he dies in kufr before reaching the age of puberty, then his case rests with Allaah in the Hereafter.
If a person is good or humble or generous or respectful towards his parents or any other worthy characteristic, this will not help him at all with Allaah; he will get his reward in this world. ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) reported that she asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “O Messenger of Allaah, during the Jaahiliyyah, ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Jad’aan used to uphold the ties of kinship, set captives free and honour his guests (and she mentioned a number of good characteristics, but he was a mushrik and died as such). Will that be of any benefit to him?” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No, for he never said, ‘O Lord forgive me my sins on the Day of Reckoning” – meaning that he was a kaafir who did not believe in the resurrection and reckoning, so the good deeds he used to do will not benefit him. A similar example is Haatim al-Tayy; the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told his daughter Sufaanah, “If your father had been a Muslim we would have prayed for mercy for him.”

In other words, the source of my salary comes from the consumption of pig meat (pork) which is haram. My question is: Is this money halal and I can take the job, or should I decline it? I apreciate your quick response to give my word. Jazakumu Allahu Khairun.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The meat of pigs is haraam for the Muslim because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘I find not in that which has been revealed to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it be Maytah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth (by slaughtering or the like), or the flesh of swine (pork); for that surely, is impure or impious (unlawful) meat (of an animal) which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allaah (or has been slaughtered for idols, or on which Allaah’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering). But whosoever is forced by necessity without wilful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits; (for him) certainly, your Lord is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful.’” [al-An’aam 6:145]
 Buying it and selling it are also forbidden.
 It was reported from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with them both) that he heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say during the year of the Conquest [of Makkah] when he was in Makkah: “Allaah and His Messenger have forbidden the sale of alcohol, dead meat, pork and idols.” It was said: “O Messenger of Allaah, what about the fat of dead animals, which is daubed on ships and animal skins, and which people use in their lamps?” He said, “No, it is haraam.” Then the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “May Allaah curse the Jews, for when Allaah forbade the fat (of dead animals) for them, they melted it then they sold it and consumed its price.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2121; Muslim, 1581).
When Allaah forbids a thing, He forbids its price. Similarly, the means to something haraam is also haraam; the means comes under the same rulings as the end. It is not permissible for a Muslim to help evildoers in their evil. He is obliged as much as possible to come between them and their evil, and try to prevent them from doing that, not to improve the haraam thing and help to develop it.
 Would you like to be the means of improving and making haraam things attractive and encouraging people to do them, so that you are helping to spread them further? I think you would reply: I do not want for myself anything that my Creator would not be pleased with, I will not work for falsehood, no matter what they pay me. Provision is in the hand of Allaah, so you must look for other, permissible, work. We ask Allaah to give you sufficient from what He has permitted so there will be no need of that which He has forbidden.

      about immoral actions","There
      is much talk of homosexuality, and how much it is forbidden. I find this
      topic ""almost"" totaly solved. You say it is haram to be a
      homosexual. The are two main factors which come to mind. My question is,
      is the act of having homosexual relations haram, or the though of being
      homosexual/having homosexual thoughts? Is there a way to repent for those
      unfortunate?",,,"Praise be to Allah.There
      is no doubt that homosexuality and lesbianism are forbidden, as mentioned
      in the question, and doing these actions is a major sin which deserves the
      wrath of the Lord and His painful punishment. The Lawgiver is wise and
      does not forbid anything to people unless it is harmful and damaging to
      them in this world and in the Hereafter. As far as merely thinking about
      such sins is concerned, a person will not be punished for that, so long as
      he does not do it or talk about it, as the Prophet 
 (peace and
      blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah will forgive my Ummah for
      whatever crosses their minds, so long as they do not act upon it or speak
      about it.
 But
      thinking a lot about something could lead to a person doing it; at the
      very least it distracts a person from thinking about something useful that
      he could do. The scholars of Islam used to call for reform of one’s
      thinking and striving against bad thoughts, because they may gradually
      lead one to disastrous consequences. The “doctor of the hearts” Ibn
      al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:
“Ward
      off passing thoughts, for if you do not, they will become ideas. Ward off
      ideas, for if you do not, they will become desires. Fight them, for if you
      do not, they will become resolve and determination, and if you do not ward
      them off, they will become actions. If you do not resist them with their
      opposite, they will become habits and it will be difficult for you to get
      rid of them.” (Al-Fawaa’id
      by Ibn al-Qayyim, p. 33).
The
      way to repent is clear: give up the sin immediately; regret what has
      happened; resolve never to go back to it; do a lot of good deeds, for they
      wipe out bad deeds; keep away from the people with whom you used to commit
      this sin and shun them if they do not repent; keep away from bad company
      and everything that calls you to this sin. And Allaah will accept the
      repentance of those who repent to Him.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

 It is the girl’s right to have sufficient information about the person who wants to marry her. This may be achieved by enquiring about him through various channels, such as asking some of her relatives to ask his friends and those who know him well about him, because they may know a lot about his good and bad points which other people would not know about.
 But it is not permissible for her under any circumstances to be alone with him (khulwah) before marriage, or to take off her hijaab in front of him. It is well known that in such meetings the man does not show his true nature, but rather he is on his best behaviour and tries to make a good impression. Even if she were to be alone with him or to go out with him, he will not show he his true character. Many of those who go out with a fiancé in this sinful manner end up in tragedy and these sinful steps, whether they were taken in private or in public, do not bring any benefits.
 Often the fiancé will use sweet words and play with the emotions of his fiancée when he goes out with her, and he shows her his best side, but when she makes enquiries about him and tries to find out more about him, she will discover something entirely different. So going out with him or being alone with him does not solve the problem. Even if for the sake of argument we were to say that it does serve some purpose in finding out about the man's character, the resulting sin and possibility of leading to bad consequences is far greater than that (potential benefit). This is why Islam forbids being alone with a strange (non-mahram) man – and the fiancé is still a stranger – or taking off one’s hijaab in front of him.
 We should not forget another important matter, which is that after the marriage ceremony (nikaah) and before the wedding night (when the marriage is celebrated and consummated), the woman has ample opportunity to get to know the man's character up close and to make sure about him, because now it is permissible for her to be alone with him and to go out with him, so long as the marriage contract has been concluded. If she discovers something bad that she really cannot put up with, then she can ask him for Khul’ (divorce). But usually the outcome is not so bad, so long as one has made enquiries about the person and found out about him in a proper fashion before the nikaah.
We ask Allaah to choose what is best for you and to make things easy for you wherever you are. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
