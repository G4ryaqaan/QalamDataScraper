“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned. ‘Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error.’” [al-Baqarah 2:286]
And it says in the hadith that Allah said, “I have done that”, i.e., I have forgiven you. 
But if it is possible to prevent it, or to spit it out, and you do not do so and you swallow it deliberately, then this breaks the fast. The evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to Laqit ibn Sabrah: “Go to extremes when rinsing your nose , unless you are fasting.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 2366; al-Tirmidhi, 788; al-Nasai, 87; Ibn Majah, 407. Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 631) 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: 
“This indicates that the fasting person should not go to the extreme in rinsing his nose , and we do not know of any reason for this apart from the fact that doing so may be a cause of making water reach the stomach, which would invalidate the fast. Based on this we say: everything that reaches the stomach via the nose breaks the fast.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/379)

If sufficient people undertake to do it then the rest are absolved of sin.  Some of the scholars are of the view that it is fard ‘ayn (an individual obligation) like Jumu’ah prayer. Because the Islamic centers organize the Eid prayers according to the sighting of the moon, those who cannot attend are absolved of this communal obligation. It is not permissible to delay the prayer until the second or third day of Shawwaal so that all the Muslims in London can attend, because this delay is contrary to that on which the Sahaabah and those who came after them were agreed. We do not know of any scholar who suggested this. Yes, it is permissible to delay the prayer until the second day if they did not know it was Eid until after the sun had reached its zenith.

27014,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/27014,"If he recites “Is not Allaah the Best of judges?” in the prayer, should he say, “Bala (Yes indeed)?",Is saying “Bala (Yes indeed)” during the prayer after the verse “Is not Allaah the Best of judges?” [al-Teen 95:5] after other verses regarded as invalidating the prayer?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    Speaking during prayer was permitted. The Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions used to return 
    salaams when they were praying. Then that was forbidden, and the scholars 
    are unanimously agreed that it is forbidden to speak during the prayer and 
    the prayer is invalidated if one does that knowingly and deliberately.  

    It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: We used to greet the Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he was praying, and he would 
    return the greeting. When we came back from being with the Negus, we greeted 
    him and he did not respond. We said: O Messenger of Allaah, we used to greet 
    you when you were praying and you would return the greeting. He said: “One 
    should concentrate fully in prayer.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari(1141) and 
    Muslim (538). 

    It was narrated that Zayd ibn Arqam said: We used to speak 
    during the prayer; a man would speak to his neighbour whilst they were 
    praying, until the verse was revealed: “And stand before Allaah with 
    obedience [and do not speak to others during the Salaah (prayers)]” 
    [al-Baqarah 2:238]. Then we were commanded to remain silent and 
    forbidden to speak. 

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1142) and Muslim (539). 

    Al-Nawawi said: 

    With regard to the words: “And stand before Allaah with 
    obedience [and do not speak to others during the Salaah (prayers)]” 
    [al-Baqarah 2:238], it was said: What is meant is obedient, or silent. 

    The phrase “Then we were commanded to remain silent and 
    forbidden to speak” indicates that all kinds of human speech are forbidden 
    during prayer. The scholars are unanimously agreed that speaking 
    deliberately during the prayer, knowing that it is forbidden and for no 
    purpose invalidates the prayer. End quote. 

    Sharh Muslim (5/27). 

    Secondly: 

    Al-Nawawi said in Adaab Qiraa’at al-Qur’aan: 

    Chapter on the etiquette that is dictated by need. 

    If he recites the words of Allaah (interpretation of the 
    meaning): “Allaah sends His Salaah (Graces, Honours, Blessings, Mercy) on 
    the Prophet (Muhammad), and also His angels (ask Allaah to bless and forgive 
    him)” [al-Ahzaab 33:56], it is mustahabb for him to say: “Sall-Allaahu 
    ‘alayhi wa sallama tasleeman (May Allaah send blessing and  peace upon 
    him).” 

    If one recites the verse “Is not Allaah the Best of 
    judges?” [al-Teen 95:5] or “Is not He (Allaah Who does that) Able to 
    give life to the dead?” [al-Qiyaamah 75:40], it is mustahabb to say: “Bala 
    wa ana ‘ala dhaalika min al-shaahideen (Yes indeed, and I am among those 
    who bear witness to that)”. If he recites “In what message after this 
    will they then believe?” [al-A’raaf 7:185] it is mustahabb to say “Aamantu 
    Billaah (I believe in Allaah).” 

    All of that it is mustahabb for the reciter to say whether 
    during prayer or otherwise.  

    A number of ahaadeeth have been narrated concerning that, 
    some of which are saheeh and some are da’eef. 

    Abu Dawood (884) narrated that Moosa ibn Abi ‘Aa’ishah said: 
    A man was praying on the roof of his house, and when he recited: “Is not 
    He (Allaah Who does that) Able to give life to the dead?” [al-Qiyaamah 
    75:40] he said: “Subhaanaka fa bala (Glory to be You, yes 
    indeed).” They asked him about that and he said: “I heard it from the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).” 
    Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 

    It was narrated from Ismaa’eel ibn Umayyah: I heard a Bedouin 
    say: I heard Abu Hurayrah say: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever among you recites 
    Wa’l-teeni wa’l-zaytoon (“By the fig, and the olive” Soorat al-Teen 95), 
    when he reaches the end of it, “Is not Allaah the Best of judges?” 
    [al-Teen 95:5], let him say: “Bala wa ana ‘ala dhaalika min 
    al-shaahideen (Yes indeed, and I am among those who bear witness to 
    that)”.  Whoever recites La uqsimu bi yawm il-qiyaamah (“I swear 
    by the Day of Resurrection” Soorat al-Qiyaamah 75), when he reaches the 
    words “Is not He (Allaah Who does that) Able to give life to the dead?” 
    [al-Qiyaamah 75:40], let him say: “Bala (Yes indeed). And whoever 
    recites Wa’l-mursalaat (“By the winds (or angels or the Messengers 
    of Allaah) sent forth one after another” Soorat al-Mursalaat 77), when 
    he reaches the words “Then in what statement after this (the Qur’aan) 
    will they believe?” [al-Mursalaat 77:50], let him say: Aamanna Billaah 
    (We believe in Allaah).’ 

    Narrated by Abu Dawood (887). It was classed as da’eef by 
    al-Albaani in Da’eef Abi Dawood. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ 
    (3/397-399): 

    If the reciter says “Is not He (Allaah Who does that) Able 
    to give life to the dead?” [al-Qiyaamah 75:40], then he may say: Bala 
    (Yes indeed), or Subhaanaka fa bala (Glory be to You, yes indeed), 
    because there is a hadeeth about that from the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and Imam Ahmad stated that. Imam Ahmad 
    said: If he recites “Is not He (Allaah Who does that) Able to give life 
    to the dead?” [al-Qiyaamah 75:40] during prayer or otherwise, he may 
    say, “Subhaanaka fa bala (Glory be to You, yes indeed)” both in 
    obligatory and naafil prayers. 

    If he recites “Is not Allaah the Best of judges?” [al-Teen 
    95:5], he should say, “Subhaanaka fa bala (Glory be to You, yes 
    indeed)”.  

    If he recites, “Is there any ilaah (god) with Allaah?” 
    [al-Naml 29:60], he may say, La ilaaha ill-Allaah (There is no 
    god but Allaah). End quote. 

    Thus it is clear that these phrases are not included in the 
    speech that is forbidden during prayer and which invalidates it; rather what 
    is forbidden during prayer is normal human speech as the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “This prayer is not the right 
    place for any of the people’s speech.” Narrated by Muslim (537). 

    Al-Nawawi said: What this means is that it is not the right 
    place for any of the people’s usual speech and conversation. End quote.

In the scenario mentioned in the question, the obligatory duty had been discharged by those who prayed first – those to whom the Imam was delivering the Khutbah. 
For those who missed it and want to make it up, it is recommended for them to do so, so they should pray it without a Khutbah afterwards. This was the view of Imam Malik, Ash-Shafi`i, Ahmad, An-Nakhi`i and other scholars (may Allah have mercy on them). 
The basic principle concerning that is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “When you come to the prayer, walk in a tranquil and dignified manner, and whatever you catch up with, pray, and whatever you miss, make it up.”  
It was narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that if he missed the `Eid prayer with the Imam, he would gather his family and freed slaves, then his freed slave `Abdullah ibn Abu `Utbah would stand up and lead them in praying two Rak`ahs in which he would say the Takbirs .

    Note that this universe and all the created beings in it is 
    in thrall to Allaah, whether by choice or by force. The believer worships 
    Allaah by choice and is rewarded for his worship. Even though the kaafir may 
    be alienated from his Lord and failing to worship Him, the atoms of his body 
    and everything in him is worshipping Him and glorifying Him, but because our 
    understanding and perception are limited, we are unaware of that tasbeeh 
    (glorification of Allaah) and unable to understand its nature. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, 
    glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His Praise. But you 
    understand not their glorification. Truly, He is Ever Forbearing, 
    Oft-Forgiving”

    [al-Isra’ 17:44]
What this means is that 
    every created being is in a state of submission to Allaah and worships Him 
    in a manner appropriate to its situation. The sun, moon, stars, trees and 
    animals are all in a state of subjugation to Allaah and prostrate to Him, 
    and all of them worship Him in an appropriate manner. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“See you not that 
    whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth, and the sun, and the 
    moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and Ad-Dawaabb 
    [moving (living) creatures, beasts], and many of mankind prostrate 
    themselves to Allaah. But there are many (men) on whom the punishment is 
    justified. And whomsoever Allaah disgraces, none can honour him. Verily, 
    Allaah does what He wills”
[al-Hajj 22:18] 
“Have they not 
    observed things that Allaah has created: (how) their shadows incline to the 
    right and to the left, making prostration unto Allaah, and they are lowly?
And to Allaah 
    prostrate all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, of the 
    moving (living) creatures and the angels, and they are not proud [i.e. they 
    worship their Lord (Allaah) with humility]”
[al-Nahl 16:48-49]

    Imaam Ibn Katheer said: Allaah is telling us of His Might, 
    Majesty and Pride, for everything submits to Him and all things and 
    creatures humble themselves before Him, inanimate objects and animals, and 
    those which are accountable among mankind and the jinn, and the angels. 
    Allaah tells us that everything that has a shadow that inclines towards the 
    right and towards the left – i.e., morning and evening – prostrates to 
    Allaah. Mujaahid said: When the sun passes its zenith everything prostrates 
    to Allaah. 

    Allaah has confirmed that all beings prostrate to Him, and He 
    has explained how some of them prostrate, which is by the inclining of its 
    shadow towards the right and the left. It does not mean that everything 
    prostrates on seven parts of the body; that applies only to the Muslims. The 
    prostration of all other beings is in accordance with their nature. The fact 
    that this prostration is prostration in the real sense is indicated by the 
    apparent meaning of the text, because there is no valid reason for not 
    interpreting the text as it appears to be, so we must accept it. That is 
    also supported by the fact that the prostration of the sun, moon, stars, 
    trees and animals is mentioned in conjunction with the prostration of the 
    angels and humans, which indicates that this is prostration in a real sense 
    for all the entities mentioned. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said:  

    Prostration is a form of humility, so the prostration which 
    includes all creatures implies the utmost submission and humility. For every 
    created thing submits to His greatness and humbles itself before His might 
    and power. This does not mean that everything prostrates like human beings 
    do, on seven parts of the body, putting the forehead on the ground. This 
    kind of prostration is only for human beings. Some other nations bow but do 
    not prostrate, and that is their prostration. Allaah says (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 

    ‘and enter the gate in prostration (or bowing with 
    humility) and say: “Forgive us”’

    [al-Baqarah 2:58]
It was said that this 
    means enter it bowing, and some of them prostrate on their sides like the 
    Jews. Sujood (prostration) is a generic term but because the way in which 
    Muslims prostrate is so well known, many people think that this is how 
    everything prostrates. 

    Jaami’ al-Rasaa’il, 1/27 

    And he said: 
It is known that 
    everything prostrates according to its nature, and the prostration of these 
    created entities does not mean that they put their foreheads on the ground. 

    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 21/284 

    This prostration includes the submission and humbling of 
    these created entities to Allaah and their surrendering to His Lordship, 
    Might and Sovereignty. Imam Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
“It is the prostration of 
    humility and submission, for everything submits to His Lordship, humbles 
    itself before His Might and is subject to His Sovereignty.” 

    Madaarij al-Saalikeen, 1/107 

    The prostration of these created entities is a prostration in 
    a real sense as befits each of these entities. So man prostrates in the 
    manner that suits him, in the manner that is well known, on seven parts of 
    the body. The sun prostrates in the manner that suits it, as mentioned in 
    the saheeh hadeeth of Abu Dharr (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: 
    “The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Abu 
    Dharr when the sun had set, ‘Do you know where it went?’ I said, ‘Allaah and 
    His Messenger know best.’ He said, ‘It has gone to prostrate beneath the 
    Throne, then it asks for permission to rise, but soon it will prostrate and 
    its prostration will not be accepted, and it will ask for permission to rise 
    and that will not be granted to it, and it will be said to it, “Go back from 
    whence you came,” and it will rise from the west. This is what Allaah says: 

    “And the sun runs on its fixed course for a term 
    (appointed). That is the Decree of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing”

    [Yaa-Seen 36:38].’”

    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3199) 

    So it prostrates in a real sense, as is suited to the sun, 
    but how does it prostrate to Allaah beneath the Throne? Allaah knows best 
    how this prostration happens. The apparent meaning of the hadeeth proves 
    that what this prostration means is not simply submission to the command of 
    Allaah and obedience to Him. Indeed, it is submission, humility and 
    surrender by prostrating in a real sense, but we do not understand how it 
    happens. Similarly it is said that the moon, the trees, the animals and all 
    other entities prostrate in a manner that suits them. What the believer 
    should do is not to let the fact that he does not know how some entities 
    prostrate prevent him from believing in this prostration, rather he must 
    believe in what Allaah has told him about other entities prostrating to Him.

Ghusl means letting water run over every part of the body. Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 1/128. 
It is essential to pour water on the hair and make it reach what is beneath the hair. Simply wiping over the head is not sufficient because it is not regarded as ghusl (washing); what is required is washing not wiping. 
It was narrated that Aa’ishah said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did ghusl from janaabah, he would start by washing his two hands, then he would pour water into his left hand with his right hand and wash his private part, then do wudoo’ as for prayer, then he would take the water and, using his fingers, make it reach the roots of his hair, until he was certain that the water had reached the roots of his hair, then he would pour three scoops of water over his head, then he would pour water over the rest of his body, then he would wash his feet.” 
Narrated by Muslim, 474. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in his commentary on this hadeeth: It is essential when doing ghusl from janaabah to make sure the water reaches what is under the hair, even if the hair is thick. 
This is understood from the fact that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) put his fingers in his hair and poured water over it three times after he made sure that the water was reaching the roots of his hair. 
Sharh Buloogh al-Maraam, p. 399

Some of them say that it is not allowed to take what one is entitled to from a wrongdoer, and some say that it is allowed subject to the condition that he does not take more than he is entitled to and that there is no risk of being found out and punished. The latter is the correct view. 
Shaykh al-Shanqeeti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
If someone wrongs you and takes something of yours in an unlawful manner, and you cannot prove it, but you are able to do something similar to the way in which he wronged you, with no risk of being found out or punished, do you have the right to take what you are entitled to or not? 
The more correct of the two scholarly opinions, and the one which seems closest to the apparent meaning of the texts and is based on the more sound analogy, is that you may take that to which you are entitled, and no more, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“then punish them with the like of that with which you were afflicted” [al-Nahl 16:126] 
“Then whoever transgresses the prohibition against you, you transgress likewise against him” [al-Baqarah 2:194]
Among the scholars who were of this view are: Ibn Sireen, Ibraaheem al-Nakha’i, Sufyaan and others. 
A number of scholars – including Maalik – said that this was not permitted. This is the view of Khaleel ibn Ishaaq al-Maaliki in his Mukhtasar, where he said concerning goods placed with a person for safekeeping: He does not have the right to take anything from them because that person wronged him. Those who held this view quoted as evidence the hadeeth: “Render back trusts to the one who entrusted it to you, and do not betray the one who betrays you.” 
This hadeeth – even if we assume that it is saheeh – cannot be taken as evidence in this context, because the one who takes as much as he is entitled to, and no more, is not betraying the one who betrayed him, rather he is settling the score fairly with the one who wronged him. 
Adwa’ al-Bayaan, 3/353 
This is also the view of al-Bukhaari and al-Shaafa’i, as narrated by Abu Zar’ah al-‘Iraaqi in Tarh al-Tathreeb, 8/226. Al-Tirmidh narrated that it was the view of some of the Taabi’een, among whom he mentioned Sufyaan al-Thawri.  
The hadeeth quoted by those who do not allow it is the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah who said: The Prophet (S) said: “Render back trusts to the one who entrusted it to you, and do not betray the one who betrays you.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1264; Abu Dawood, 3535; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 423. 
So you can take what you are entitled to from this Jew who owns the workplace, provided that you do not take more than what you are entitled to, and provided that there is no risk of being found out, which may damage the image of Islam, because you cannot prove your rights to people. If he gives you what you are entitled to after that, in whole or in part, then you have to return what you took from him that is surplus to what you are entitled to.

Levels of Hell 


Least severe level of Hell


Number of degrees and levels in Paradise 


Highest degree of Paradise","Praise be to Allah.Number of Paradise and Hell
With regard to numbers, there is one Hell and one Paradise , but each of them has degrees and levels. 
Paradise is sometimes mentioned in the plural in the Sunnah, but this does not mean that there are several types of Paradise; rather this is indicative of its greatness and the various degrees and levels in it, or it is indicative of the greatness of the reward of the one who enters it. 
Anas ibn Malik narrated that Umm al-Rubayyi’ bint al-Bara , who was the mother of Harithah ibn Suraqah, came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: O Prophet of Allah, will you not tell me about Harithah?” – who had been killed at the battle of Badr by a stray arrow. “If he is in Paradise I will bear it with patience but if it is otherwise then I shall weep long and hard for him.” He said: “O Umm Haritha, there are gardens in Paradise – according to another report: many gardens – and your son has attained the highest Firdaws .” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2809) 
Levels of Hell 
The levels of Hell differ according to the extent of their inhabitants’ disbelief in this world. The hypocrites will be in the lowest level of Hell, as our Lord has told us (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth (grade) of the Fire; no helper will you find for them.” [Al-Nisa 4:145]
Least severe level of Hell
The least severe (in torment) of its levels – from which we seek refuge with Allah – was mentioned by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the Hadith reported by al-Nu’man ibn Bashir who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The least severely punished of the people of Hell will be a man who has two shoes and shoelaces of Fire – according to another version: two live coals will be placed on the soles of his feet – because of which his brains will boil as a pot boils. He will not think that anyone is being punished more severely than him, but he will be the one who is punished most lightly.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6562; Muslim, 212) 
The person is named specifically in a report narrated by Muslim, where it says that this is Abu Talib, the paternal uncle of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), for whom Allah will reduce the punishment because of the role he played in protecting Islam at the beginning. 
Number of degrees and levels in Paradise 
We know of no limit to the number of degrees and levels in Paradise . It was said that their number is equal to the number of verses in the Quran, based on the Hadith of ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr, who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It will be said to the companion of the Quran: ‘Recite and rise in status as you used to recite in the world, and your position will be at the last verse you recite.’” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1646; al-Tirmidhi, 2914; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud) 
Al-Mundhiri said in al-Targhib: al-Khattabi said: 
“It said in the report that the number of verses in the Quran is the number of degrees or levels of Paradise in the Hereafter, and it will be said to the reader: ‘Rise through the levels to the extent that you used to read the verses of the Quran. Whoever recites all of the Quran, will reach the highest degree of Paradise in the Hereafter, and whoever recites part of it will reach a level commensurate with that, and the limit of his reward will match the limit of his reading.” (Al-Targhib wa’l-Tarhib, 2/228)
But this idea is subject to further discussion, because the Hadith speaks of the manazil (status, position) of those who memorized Quran, not of their darajat (degrees, levels). 
The darajah (degree or level) varies according to their efforts in this world, just as there are other acts of faith in which people vary in status, such as sincere faith, jihad and others. So we cannot say that the one who memorized the entire Quran will be in the highest degrees of Paradise in absolute terms. 
Highest degree of Paradise
The highest of the degrees of Paradise is al-Firdaws, as it was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “… When you ask of Allah, ask Him for al-Firdaws, for it is in the middle of Paradise and is the highest part of Paradise, and above it is the Throne of the Most Merciful, and from it spring forth the rivers of Paradise.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2637; Muslim, 2831) 
What is meant by the “middle of Paradise” is the best of it, as when Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Thus We have made you a just (and the best) nation (lit. a middle nation).” [Al-Baqarah 2:143]
Position of those who do certain actions in Paradise
The Sunnah also describes the position of those who do certain actions. For example: 

Faith in Allah and belief in the Messengers

Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The people of Paradise will be able to see the people in the apartments above them as you see the shining stars on the horizon in the east and the west, because of the differences in their status.” They said: “O Messenger of Allah, is that the status of the prophets which no one else will reach besides them?” He said: “No, by the One in Whose Hand is my soul, they are men who had faith in Allah and believed in the Messengers.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2082; Muslim, 2831) 

Jihad for the sake of Allah 

Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “In Paradise there are one hundred degrees which Allah has prepared for those who strive in jihad for the sake of Allah. The distance between each two degrees is like the distance between the heavens and the earth.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2637. 

The one who sincerely desires martyrdom may also attain that 

Sahl ibn Hanif narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever asks Allah sincerely for martyrdom, Allah will cause him to reach the status of the martyrs even if he dies in his bed.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1909. 

Spending for the sake of Allah 

Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The poor came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “The rich people have taken all the highest positions. They pray as we pray, and they fast as we fast, but they have surplus wealth with which they perform Hajj and strive in jihad and give in charity…” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 807; Muslim, 595) 

Doing wudu properly even when it is difficult, taking many steps towards the mosque and waiting for prayer after prayer. 

Abu Hurayrah narrated the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Shall I not tell you of something by means of which Allah erases sins and raises you in status?” They said: “Yes, O Messenger of Allah.” He said: “Doing wudu well even when it is difficult, taking many steps to the mosques and waiting for prayer after prayer. That is (equivalent) to guarding the frontier.” (Narrated by Muslim, 251) 

Memorizing Quran 

‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It will be said to the companion of the Quran: ‘Recite and rise in status as you used to recite in the world, and your position will be at the last verse you recite.’” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1646; al-Tirmidhi, 2914; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud)

[Yoonus 10:57]
There is no book that reforms hearts and heals them of disease like the Qur’aan. Hence the Muslim should not turn away from it towards other books. The Muslim should read Qur’aan a great deal with proper focus and humility, pondering the meanings. He will see the effect of that on his heart.

27082,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/27082,punishing Oneself as Encourage to do Good?,"I know that punishing oneself and depriving oneself is effective in encouraging oneself to do good, but how can I punish myself?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The believer who is keen to save himself will strive to save himself from everything that may lead to his doom, and he is kind to himself. Part of that kindness is taking care of one’s relationship with Allah so that he will be saved from the punishment of the Hereafter, and striving to make himself do that which is enjoined upon him and to avoid that which is forbidden to him, seeking thereby the pleasure of Allah. So he starts by repenting from all sins, and urging himself to compete in doing righteous deeds, and striving to reach high levels of faith, by applying the appropriate means, such as learning about the rewards for good deeds, the effects and causes of sin, keeping away from those who discourage him and are lacking in ambition, listening to stories of those who strive in worship. Then if he weakens in doing righteous deeds or commits sin, or finds that he is inclined towards it, this is the time for punishment.  
Punishment comes after learning the truth and deviating from it. You should not start with punishment because there is no punishment before knowledge and knowledge leaves no excuse.  
You should also note – may Allah bless you – that punishment should not be sought as an end in and of itself, rather it is a means of disciplining the self. This is like cauterization for one who is sick, which is only used as much as is necessary. 
It is not good to punish yourself and burden yourself with more than you can bear, or with things that cause physical harm, such as burning yourself with fire or standing in the sun, etc. Rather punishment should take the form of obliging yourself to do more righteous deeds, without causing too much hardship, or depriving yourself of things that you like. However, you know yourself best and you know what makes you more lazy and pushes you towards sin, and you should avoid these things.  
Al-Maqdisi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
If the believer checks himself and sees some shortcoming or he commits some sin, he should not take the matter lightly, for that may lead to him committing sin regularly and then it will be difficult for him to give up that sin. Rather he should punish himself in a permissible manner just as he would discipline his wife and children. It was narrated that ‘Umar went out to a garden he owned, then he came back and the people had prayed ‘Asr, so he said, “I went out to my garden and when I came back the people had prayed ‘Asr; I give my garden in charity for the poor.” 
And it was narrated that Tameem al-Daari (may Allah be pleased with him) slept one night and did not get up to pray Tahajjud (late night prayer)until dawn came, so he prayed qiyaam al-layl (voluntary night prayers) for a year and did not sleep in order to punish himself for sleeping that night. 
Hassaan ibn Sinaan passed by a room and said, “When was this built?” Then he thought to himself and said, “Are you asking about something that is not your concern? I will punish myself by fasting for a year,” and he fasted that year. 
But with regard to punishments that cause physical harm or involve doing something reprehensible, they are not permissible. It was narrated that a man looked at a woman, then he put his eyes out, and that another disobeyed Allah with his hand, so he put his hand into the fire until it became paralyzed. Such actions are not permissible, and a man cannot treat himself in this way.

Best types of Hajj","Praise be to Allah.How to perform hajj
There follows a summary of what the pilgrim should do according to the sahih Sunnah: 

The pilgrim should enter ihram on the eighth day of Dhul-Hijjah from Makkah or its environs within the sanctuary. When entering ihram for Hajj he should do what he did when entering ihram for `Umrah: ghusl (full ablution), putting on perfume and praying. He should form the intention of entering ihram for Hajj and recite the Talbiyah . The Talbiyah for Hajj is the same as the Talbiyah for `Umrah, except that one should say here “Labbayka hajjan (Here I am for Hajj)” instead of “Labbayka ‘umratan (Here I am for `Umrah).” If he fears that some obstacle may prevent him from completing Hajj, he should stipulate a condition and say: “If something prevents me (from completing Hajj) I will exit ihram at the point where I am prevented (from continuing).” If he is not afraid of any obstacle then he does not need to stipulate any condition. 
Then he should go to Mina and stay there overnight, and offer five prayers there: Zuhr, ‘Asr, Maghrib, ‘Isha and Fajr. 
When the sun rises on the ninth day he should proceed to `Arafah and pray Zuhr and `Asr together there, shortened, at the time of Zuhr. Then he should strive in du’a, dhikr and prayers for forgiveness until the sun sets. 
When the sun sets, he should proceed to Muzdalifah and pray Maghrib and ‘Isha there when he arrives. Then he should stay there overnight until he prays Fajr, and remember Him and call upon Him until just before sunrise. 
Then he should move on to Mina to stone Jamrat al-‘Aqabah which is the last pillar that is closest to Makkah, throwing seven pebbles one after another, each one approximately the size of a date stone, saying takbir (“Allahu akbar”) with each throw. 
Then he should slaughter the hadiy (sacrificial animal), namely a sheep or one-seventh of a camel or one-seventh of a cow. 
Then he should shave his head if he is male; women should cut their hair but not shave it, taking off the length of a fingertip from all parts of their hair. 
Then he should go to Makkah and perform the tawaf of Hajj . 
Then he should go back to Mina and stay there for those nights, namely the nights of the eleventh and twelfth of Dhu’l-Hijjah, and stone the three Jamarat (stone pillars) after the sun has passed its zenith, throwing seven pebbles, one after another, at each, starting with the smallest pillar – which is the one that is furthest away from Makkah, then the middle pillar. He should recite du’a after both, then he should stone Jamrat al-‘Aqabah, after which there is no du’a. 
When he has finished stoning the pillars on the twelfth of Dhu’l-Hijjah, if he wishes he may hasten and leave Mina, and if he wishes he may delay (his departure) and stay there on the night of the thirteenth and stone the three Jamarat after the sun passes its zenith. It is better to delay and stay longer, but it is not obligatory unless the sun sets on the twelfth and one is still in Mina, in which case it becomes obligatory to stay until one stones the three jamarat after the sun passes its zenith. But if the sun sets on the twelfth day and a person is still in Mina but not by choice, such as if he had packed his bags and got into the bus or truck, but was delayed because of overcrowding and traffic jams, then he does not have to stay, because his staying until after sunset was involuntary. 
Once those days are over and the pilgrim wants to leave, he must not leave until he has performed the farewell tawaf, going around the Ka`bah seven times. Women who are menstruating or bleeding following childbirth do not have to do this farewell tawaf. 
If the pilgrim is performing a voluntary Hajj on behalf of another person, whether a relative or otherwise, then he has to have done Hajj for himself before that. There is no difference in the way he performs Hajj apart from the intention, i.e., he should form the intention of performing this Hajj on behalf of that person, mentioning him by name in the Talbiyah and saying, “Labbayk ‘an [fulan] (Here I am on behalf of [So and So]).” Then when he says du’a during the rituals he should pray for himself and for the person on whose behalf he is performing Hajj. 

Types of Hajj 
With regard to the types of Hajj, there are three: tamattu`, qiran and ifrad. 

Tamattu` is when the pilgrim enters ihram for `Umrah during the months of Hajj (which are Shawwal, Dhu’l-Qa’dah and the first ten days of Dhu’l-Hijjah) and performs `Umrah and exits ihram, then he enters ihram again for Hajj from Makkah or its environs on the day of al-Tarwiyah (the eighth day of Dhul-Hijjah) in the same year as his `Umrah. 
Qiran is when the pilgrim enters ihram for `Umrah and Hajj together, and does not exit ihram until the day of Sacrifice, or he enters ihram for `Umrah then includes Hajj with it before he starts his tawaf.
Ifrad is when the pilgrim enters ihram for Hajj from the miqat or from Makkah if he resides there or in a place that is closer than the miqat, and remains in ihram until the Day of Sacrifice if he has a hadiy with him. If he does not have a hadiy with him, it is prescribed for him to cancel his Hajj and make it `Umrah, so he should perform tawaf and sa’i, then cut his hair and exit ihram, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told those who entered ihram for Hajj but did not have a hadiy with them to do. This applies to the pilgrim doing qiran, if he does not have a hadiy with him; it is prescribed for him to cancel his qiran and make it `Umrah, for the reason mentioned. 

Best types of Hajj
The best kind of Hajj is Tamattu` for the one who has not brought a hadiy with him, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told his Companions to do that and insisted that they should do that. 
We advise you to learn more about the rulings on Hajj and `Umrah by referring to Manasik al-Hajj wa’l-`Umrah by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him), which you can obtain through the Shaykh’s website on the internet.

27091,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/27091,He prayed on his own and leading others when he was junub; what does he have to do?,"I have a very important question that needs to be answered. I performed prayer while i was in the state of junib, at first i did not know. Then i found out, but i was a careless muslim, performed some prayers when i was not in the state of purity. In some cases, when we pray at home, i become the imam. But i was too embarrased to not pray and tell them i am not clean. I would like to repent. My question is do i have to make up the prayers, or do more nafillah or what??? My carelessness led me to this problem, i was too lazy and embarrased to fix my problem then, now is the time for me to fix that problem, what should i do.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
With regard to the prayers that you offered when you were not aware of the ruling on this action, there is no sin on you for that, and you do not have to make up the prayers that you offered when you were junub. Islam excuses the one who is ignorant whether he omitted obligatory actions or committed forbidden actions, so long as he did not fail to ask and try to find out. But if he failed to ask and try to find out, then he is sinning because of that shortcoming. 
The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 
It is not valid to pray without purifying oneself, for one who is in a state of minor or major impurity, according to scholarly consensus, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! When you intend to offer As-Salaah (the prayer), wash your faces and your hands (forearms) up to the elbows, rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads, and (wash) your feet up to the ankles” [al-Maa'idah 5:6]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No prayer is accepted without purification.” Narrated by Muslim, 224. 
Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 6/259. 
Secondly:  
If you knew the Islamic ruling on praying when one is junub, and that it is not permissible for the junub person to pray until he has done ghusl, then you have sinned by doing that. You have to repent and seek forgiveness, regret what you have done and resolve not to go back to it. You also have to make up the prayers that you offered in that state. 
The Scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: 
I am a woman who has been married for seventeen years. At the beginning of my marriage I was unaware of some if not all of the rulings on ghusl following janaabah, because I was unaware of the causes of janaabah. My husband was similarly unaware. This ignorance made us think that only the husband becomes junub. I got married approximately two months before Ramadaan. At the end of Ramadaan in the same year,  I came to know the ruling. What do I have to do with regard to the prayers that I offered during that period? Please note that I took showers with the intention of making myself clean, not with the intention of purifying myself, and I did not always do that, i.e., I did not take a shower every time I had intercourse. Please also note that I always do wudoo’ for every prayer. All this is the result of ignorance on my part, of course, as I stated. And what about my fasting during the blessed month of Ramadaan? 
They replied: 
You have to make up the prayers that you offered without having done ghusl from janaabah, because of your carelessness and not trying to learn about your religion. As well as making up the prayers, you also have to repent to Allah for that. With regard to the fasts, they are valid so long as no intercourse took place during the day. 
Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 6/269. 
Thirdly: 
Those who prayed behind you do not have to repeat their prayers, because their prayers are valid, and have nothing to do with the validity of the prayer of their imam who prayed whilst junub without their knowledge. 
The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: 
A few days ago when I wanted to do wudoo’ for Maghrib prayer, I noticed some maniy (semen) on my lower garment, so I did ghusl and prayed Maghrib, but I do not know when that wet dream occurred – was it before Fajr prayer or during the mid-day nap? The point here that I want to find out is: I think that I prayed three obligatory prayers – Fajr, Zuhr and ‘Asr – in a state of janaabah without realizing. In fact I offered these three prayers as an imam, leading a group of other worshippers who numbered some three hundred. What should I do? Should I make up these three prayers? And what is the ruling on the prayer of those who prayed behind me? Is there any sin in what I did? Please advise us, may Allah reward you with good. 
They replied: 
You have to repeat your Zuhr and ‘Asr prayers after doing ghusl from janaabah, and you have to do this soon. With regard to those who offered these prayers behind you, they do not have to repeat them. ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) led the people in praying Fajr when he was junub but had forgot, so he repeated Fajr but he did not tell those who had prayed behind him to repeat it. They were excused because they did not know that he was in an impure state. But you do not have to repeat Fajr, because the maniy may have appeared during your sleep at midday, and the basic principle is that a duty has been discharged and does not need to be repeated unless there is evidence to that effect.

Christians, on the other hand, believe in the divinity of Jesus as the Son of God and the second person of the holy trinity.

Basic Tenets of Christian Belief","Praise be to Allah.Basic Tenets of Islamic Belief  
There are many great factors that widen the gaps between Muslims and Christians. The differences in belief between us and them do not let us get close unless they give up their disbelief and misguidance, and join the monotheists who believe in One Lord and God, and bear witness that the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is His Messenger, and believe that `Isa (Jesus – peace be upon him) was a human being.
Basic Tenets of Christian Belief
These are the most significant deviations in their religion, which widen the gap between us Muslims and them: 

The Messiah (peace be upon him) is a god alongside God and that he is the second person of the holy trinity .
The Messiah is the son of God .
Divinity may be incarnated in humanity.
God is formed of three  coequal consubstantial divine persons, which is known as the doctrine of the trinity.
The Messiah (peace be upon him) was crucified by the Jews on the command of Pontius Pilate, and that he died on the cross.
The Messiah died on the cross as a ransom for mankind and as expiation for original sin .
The Christian attitude towards the Jews who disbelieved in Jesus (peace be upon him) and claimed that they crucified him and killed him, and they accused his mother Mary (Maryam - peace be upon her) of fornication – of which she was innocent – yet despite all that their attitude towards them today is one of support and loyalty, and their attitude towards the Muslims who venerate Jesus (peace be upon him) and his mother is one of enmity and disavowal.
Their distortion of the Book of God, the Gospel (Injil), whether they distorted the words by changing them or by adding words, or they distorted the meaning, and in doing that they attribute things to God that cannot be attributed to Him.
The doctrine of redemption, which is their belief that God sent His only son to redeem mankind from a sin committed by the father of mankind (Adam – peace be upon him), but God was unable to forgive his sin, so He sent His only son who had no sin, to sacrifice himself in order to do away with sin. This is an attribution of imperfection to the Lord of the Worlds and a denial of the fact that Adam (peace be upon him) repented and Allah saved the Messiah (peace be upon him) from death.
Their disbelief in the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), even though he is mentioned in the Old and New Testaments.
Their belief in the soundness of the distorted Torah that they have in front of them today, which contains insults against God, describing Him as having shortcomings, and insults against the Prophets and Messengers, saying things that one can hardly dare utter, but we mention them in order to highlight the abhorrent nature of the disbelief that they follow. They describe God as weeping with regret for the Flood which drowned the people of Noah, until His eyes became sore, and the angels came to visit Him – exalted be He far above that.

They describe Lot (peace be upon him) as committing incest with his two daughters, and Noah (peace be upon him) as drinking wine until he became drunk and his `awrah (private parts) was exposed. There are even more foolish stories than that.
