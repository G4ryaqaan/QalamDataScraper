Is breastfeeding a child whilst pregnant haraam or halaal?
I hope that you can answer my question quickly.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The question of breastfeeding 
          a child during pregnancy should be referred to a capable and trustworthy

          permissible.
But if it will harm your child or the foetus, 
          then do not breastfeed him. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Should he pray Tahiyyat al-Masjid (two rak’ahs to “greet the mosque”), then say the salaams, then pray the sunnah of Fajr, or should he pray the sunnah of Fajr and will that mean that he does not have to pray Tahiyyat al-Masjid?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The

    alcohol or any other intoxicant is haraam, and anyone who has any such thing

21210,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21210,Praying Qiyam al-Layl in congregation at times other than in the month of Ramadan,Is it permissible for a group of men to gather to perform Qiyam al-Layl on a regular basis (almost every night) at times other than in the month of Ramadan?,,,"Praise be to Allah.If people want to gather to perform Qiyam al-Layl in the mosque in congregation at times other than Ramadan, this is a kind of bid’ah. 
But there is nothing wrong with a person praying it in congregation at times other than Ramadan in his house occasionally, because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) led Ibn ‘Abbaas, Ibn Mas’ood and Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan in congregation in his house. But he did not do that as a regular Sunnah (Sunnah raatibah) and he did not do it in the mosque. 
See al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, part 4, p. 82 
It should be noted that this jamaa’ah (prayer in congregation) which takes place at times other than Ramadan should not happen by agreement or prior announcement. If it so happens that a Muslim sees another Muslim praying Qiyam al-Layl and he joins him without prior agreement – as happened in the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas, for example, when he woke up and joined the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) one night – there is nothing wrong that. But if it is a meeting by prior agreement to perform Qiyam al-Layl on a regular basis, almost every night – as described in the question – this is bid’ah, as stated at the beginning of the answer. 
We will quote the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him). He said:  
“I stayed overnight in the house of my maternal aunt Maymoonah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) slept for a part of the night… and during the night, he got up and performed a light ablution from a hanging water skin, and stood up for the prayer. I, too, performed a similar ablution, then I went and stood on his left. Perhaps Sufyaan said, on his left and he drew me to his right. He prayed as much as Allah wished, then he lay down and slept until the sound of his breathing could be heard. Later on the muezzin came to him and told him that it was time for prayer. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went with him for the prayer without performing a new ablution.”  Sufyaan said to 'Amr that some people said, “The eyes of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sleep but his heart does not sleep.” ‘Amr said, “I heard ‘Ubayd bin ‘Umayr saying that the dreams of Prophets were wahy (revelation), then he recited the verse (interpretation of the meaning): ‘he [Ibraaheem] said: “O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you (offering you in sacrifice to Allah)”’ [al-Saaffaat 37:102].”

21212,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21212,How Long Does the Punishment of the Grave Last?,"I would like to ask about the grave: after the two angels have finished questioning the person in his grave, will the evildoer continue to be tormented in his grave until the Hour begins? 
Also, will the believer continue to enjoy delight until the Hour begins? Or does that simply last for one day which comes to an end, after which the person becomes just a dead body?
Is there any evidence to indicate that the person in his grave moves into a new life which will last until the Hour begins? Please answer me, may Allah bless you.",The life in al-barzakh starts after death and ends when the Hour begins. Quranic verses and hadiths indicate that the torment of the grave is real and that it is ongoing in the case of some people.,"Stages of man’s life


How long is life in al-barzakh?","Praise be to Allah.Stages of man’s life
Man’s life is divided into three sections: 

The life of this world, which ends with death. 
The life in al-barzakh, which starts after death and ends when the Hour begins. 
The life of the Hereafter, which begins after the people are raised from their graves, and is spent either in Paradise (we ask Allah of His Bounty) or in Hell (we seek refuge with Allah). 

How long is life in al-barzakh?
So the life of al-barzakh lasts from after a person dies until he is resurrected, whether he is buried in a grave or not, whether he is burned or eaten by wild animals. The evidence that points to this life is the hadith narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who said that after the deceased is placed in his grave, he can hear the footsteps of his family (as they walk away from the grave). 
This life (in al-barzakh ) will either be filled with delight, or it will be hellish, and the grave will either be one of the gardens of Paradise or one of the ditches of Hell. 
What indicates that there will be either delight or torment (in al-barzakh ) is the verse in which Allah says concerning the people of Pharaoh: 
“The Fire, they are exposed to it, morning and afternoon. And on the Day when the Hour will be established (it will be said to the angels): ‘Cause Fir`awn’s (Pharaoh) people to enter the severest torment!’” [Ghafir 40:46 – interpretation of the meaning]
Ibn Mas’ud said: “The souls of the people of Pharaoh and those of their ilk among the disbelievers are shown the Fire morning and evening, and they are told, this is your abode.” 
Ibn Kathir said: “This verse is the main basis of the Sunni’s belief in the torment of al-barzakh in the grave.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 4/82) 
Al-Qurtubi said: 
“Some of the scholars quoted as evidence to prove the torment of the grave the phrase “The Fire, they are exposed to it, morning and afternoon” [Ghafir 40:46]. A similar view was expressed by Mujahid, ‘Ikrimah, Muqatil and Muhammad ibn Ka`b, all of whom said that this verse is proof of the torment of the grave . Do you not see that it says concerning the torment of the Hereafter: “And on the Day when the Hour will be established (it will be said to the angels): ‘Cause Fir‘awn’s (Pharaoh) people to enter the severest torment!”?” (Tafsir al-Qurtubi, 15/319) 
`Abd-Allah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘When any one of you dies, he is shown his place morning and evening. If he is one of the people of Paradise then he is one of the people of Paradise, and if he is one of the people of Hell, then he is one of the people of Hell.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, Bid’ al-Khalq, 3001; Muslim, al-Jannah wa sifat na’imiha, 2866) 
`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that a Jewish woman entered upon her and mentioned the torment of the grave, and said to her, “May Allah protect you from the torment of the grave!” `Aishah asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about the torment of the grave, and he said, “Yes, the torment of the grave.”  `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “I never saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) pray any prayer after that but he sought refuge with Allah from the torment of the grave.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, al-Janaiz, 1283; Muslim, al-Kusuf, 903) 
These verses and hadiths indicate that the torment of the grave is real and that it is ongoing in the case of some people. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him and save him from the torment of the grave) said: 
If a person is a disbeliever (we seek refuge with Allah), then there is no way that the delight will ever reach him, and his torment will be continuous . If a person was a sinner but he was a believer, then his torment in the grave will be commensurate with his sin, and perhaps the punishment for his sin will take less time than the time in al-barzakh between his death and the onset of the Hour, in which case it will cease.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, vol. 3, p. 253)

21213,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21213,Selling cards to crack the codes blocking permissive channels,"A person bought a “digital receiver”, but the issue here is not whether buying this equipment is permissible. It came with a card for cracking the codes blocking access to permissive channels. Is it permissible for him to sell it, knowing that the purchaser has stipulated the condition that he be allowed to buy the card along with the equipment?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Everything that is used in a haraam manner, it is not 
    permissible to sell it. It is not permissible to buy or sell this equipment, 
    or to give it as a gift, because doing so is helping another to see haraam 
    things and commit immoral actions – Allaah forbid. It involves cooperating 
    in the evil which Islam came to forbid. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “but do not help one another in sin and transgression”

    [al-Maa’idah 5:2]

    What he has to do is to destroy that haraam equipment which 
    is one of the greatest means of spreading corruption and immorality in 
    society. Whoever works to spread this equipment is subject to the warning of 
    Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Verily, those who like that (the crime of) illegal sexual 
    intercourse should be propagated among those who believe, they will have a 
    painful torment in this world and in the Hereafter”

    [al-Noor 24:19]

    The questioner and all Muslims should realize that whoever 
    helps to spread corruption by facilitating its ways and means will carry the 
    sin of everyone who deviates and is affected because of that. It is an 
    ongoing evil deed which may continue even after he dies. This is a serious 
    matter to which we must pay attention. The one who tells others to do good 
    is like the one who does it, and the one who tells others to do evil is like 
    the one who does it. 

    It was narrated that Jareer ibn ‘Abd-Allaah said: “Some 
    Bedouin people came to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) wearing wool, and he saw that they were in a bad state 
    and in need. He encouraged the people to give charity to them but they were 
    too slow in responding, until it could be seen in his face (that he was 
    upset). Then a man from among the Ansaar brought a purse of silver, then 
    another came, then people came one after another, until signs of happiness 
    could be seen on the Prophet’s face. The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever starts something good in 
    Islam and others do it after him, there will be recorded for him a reward 
    equal to that of those who do it, without that detracting from their reward 
    in the slightest. And whoever starts something bad in Islam and others do it 
    after him, there will be recorded for him a burden of sin equal to that of 
    those who do it, without that detracting from their burden in the 
    slightest.’”

    (Narrated by Muslim) 

    Al-Nawawi said: 

    “The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said, ‘Whoever starts something good…’ and ‘whoever starts something bad…’ 
    According to another hadeeth he said, ‘Whoever promotes guidance…’ and 
    ‘whoever promotes misguidance…’ These two ahaadeeth clearly state that it is 
    mustahabb to start good things and that it is forbidden to start bad things. 
    Whoever starts a good thing will have a reward equal to that of everyone who 
    does it until the Day of Resurrection, and whoever starts a bad thing will 
    have a burden of sin equal to that of everyone who does it until the Day of 
    Resurrection; whoever promotes guidance will have a reward equal to that of 
    those who follow him, and whoever promotes misguidance will have a burden of 
    sin equal to that of those who follow him – regardless of whether that 
    guidance or misguidance is something that he initiated or that someone else 
    started before him, and whether that is done by teaching knowledge, or it is 
    an act or worship, or some kind of etiquette, or something else. 

    The words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him), ‘and others do it after him’ refer to when a person starts 
    something, whether others do it after him during his own lifetime or after 
    his death. And Allaah knows best.”

    (Sharh Muslim, 16/226-227) 

    So he must hasten to repent to Allaah, and destroy these 
    kinds of machines. The Muslim must use the intelligence and wisdom that 
    Allaah has given to him to spread goodness and put a stop to evil, and not 
    to crack codes etc., or to spread evil. It is not permissible to trade in 
    any means that leads to evil. And Allaah is the One Whose help we seek.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
21215,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21215,Instilling the love of the Prophet in the heart of a child,How can we develop love of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the hearts of our children? I have a young daughter – what can I do with her to achieve this?,,,"Praise be to Allah.There are a number of ways to instill love of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the hearts of our children, such as:
·The parents can tell them the stories that have been narrated of the children of the Sahaabah at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), how they fought those who tried to harm him, how quickly they responded to his call and obeyed his commands, and how they loved that which he loved, and how they memorized the hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
·The parents should help her to memorize as much hadith as she can of ahaadeeth, and reward her for that… One of the things that was narrated concerning that was the words of al-Zubayri: Maalik ibn Anas had a daughter who memorized his knowledge – i.e. al-Muwatta’. She used to stand behind the door and if a student made a mistake she would knock on the door, and Maalik would be alerted and would correct him. And it was narrated that al-Nadar ibn al-Haarith said: “I heard Ibraaheem ibn Adham say: ‘My father said to me, O my son, seek hadith, and every time you hear a hadith and memorize it, I will give you a dirham, so I learnt hadith in that way.”
·They should teach her – according to her level of understanding – about the life of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his military campaigns, and the lives of the Sahaabah, both men and women – may Allah be pleased with them, so that she will grow up loving these noble people, and be influenced by their behaviour, and will be keen to strive and sincere in correcting herself and supporting her religion.
·The Sahaabah and the salaf (early generations) were keen to teach their children about the life of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and they would teach it alongside teaching the Quran, because his seerah is the interpretation of the the meanings of the Quran, as well as stirring up emotions and demonstrating true Islam and having a wondrous effect on the soul. It also carries the meanings of love and jihad to save mankind from misguidance and bring them to guidance, from falsehood to truth, from the darkness of jaahiliyyah to the light of Islam.
When telling their daughter about the life of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the lives of the male and female Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them), the father and mother must tell her about things that she can relate to, such as the childhood of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), some stories about his life with (his wet-nurse) Haleemah al-Sa’diyyah, and how Allah bestowed goodness and blessings upon Haleemah and her family because of him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the night of the Hijrah and how Allah covered the eyes of the mushrikeen, and other stories which demonstrate how Allah helped him. Thus the girl’s heart will be filled with love for Allah and love for His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It was narrated from ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Train your children to acquire three characteristics: love of your Prophet, love of his family and reading the Quran, for the bearers of the Quran will be in the shade of Allah on the Day when there will be no shade except His, with His Prophets and His chosen ones.” (Narrated by al-Suyooti in al-Jaami’ al-Sagheer, p. 25; classed as da’eef by al-Albaani in Da’eef al-Jaami’ al-Sagheer, p. 36, no. 251). It would be a good idea if the parents  devote a suitable time for teaching the life of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) during the daily family lesson, when the children can read about seerah in simplified books, or the father or mother can tell them these stories in a manner that is appropriate to the child’s age.","From Tanshi’at al-Fataat al-Muslimah by Hanaan al-Toori, p. 171"

`Abbad ibn Tamim (may Allah have mercy on him) said, narrating from his paternal uncles: I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) lying on his back in the mosque, putting one leg on top of the other. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 475; Muslim, 2100) 
His mattress was made of leather stuffed with palm fibres, and he had a coarse woollen cloth that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would fold over twice and sleep on. 
The point is that he slept on a mattress and covered himself with a blanket. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to his wives: “Jibril never came to me whilst I was under the blanket of any one of you apart from `Aishah.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 3775)
His pillow was also leather stuffed with palm fibres. 
Du`a before sleeping
When he went to bed to sleep, he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would say : “Allahumma bismika ahya wa amut (O Allah, in Your name I live and die).” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 7394) 
He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to put his hands together and blow into them, then recite Qul Huwa Allahu ahad , Qul a’udhu bi Rabb il-Falaq and Qul a’udhu bi Rabb in-Nas [i.e., the last three surahs of the Quran), then he would wipe his hands over as much of his body as he could, starting with his head and face, and the front part of his body. He would do that three times. 
Which side did the Prophet sleep on?
He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to sleep on his right side , putting his right hand under his right cheek, then he would say: “Allahumma qini ‘adhabaka yawma tab’ath ‘ibadaka (O Allah, protect me from Your punishment on the Day You resurrect Your slaves).” 
When he went to bed he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say: “Al-hamdu Lillah alladhi at’amana wa saqana wa kafana wa awana, fakam mimman la kaafi lahu wa la mu’wi (All praise is for Allah, Who fed us and gave us to drink, and Who is sufficient for us and has sheltered us, for how many have none to suffice them or shelter them).” 
This was narrated by Muslim, who also narrated that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say when he went to bed: 
“Allahumma Rabb As-samawati wa’l-ard wa Rabb Al-‘arsh il-‘athim, Rabbana wa Rabba kulli shay’in, Faliq Al-habb wa’n-nawa wa munzil Al-Tawrati wa’l-Injili wa’l-Furqan, a’udhu bika min sharri kulli shay’in anta akhidhun bi nasiyatihi.

Sometimes he would stay up late to deal with the interests of the Muslims. His eyes slept but his heart did not. When he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) slept, they (his family) would not wake him up; he would be the one to wake up.

    [al-Nisa’ 4:123]
This negativity which 
    some of the Muslims are suffering from nowadays can have no basis in the 
    texts of sharee’ah; rather it is due to misunderstanding, helplessness and 
    laziness, and evasion of responsibility. 

    Allaah has commanded the Muslims to strive and work for this 
    religion, to call people to Allaah, to debate with the kuffaar and call them 
    with wisdom and beautiful preaching, and to fight them until there will no 
    longer be any shirk on earth. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief 
    and polytheism, i.e. worshipping others besides Allaah), and the religion 
    (worship) will all be for Allaah Alone [in the whole of the world]. But if 
    they cease (worshipping others besides Allaah), then certainly, Allaah is 
    All-Seer of what they do”

    [al-Anfaal 8:39]

    Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    Here Allaah commands us to fight the kuffaar until there is 
    no more fitnah i.e. shirk, and the religion (worship) is all for Allaah, 
    i.e., until the religion of Allaah prevails over all other religions. 

    This command does not apply only to some times and not 
    others, rather the Muslims of all times and places are commanded to do 
    this. 

    Undoubtedly working for Islam and to establish it on earth 
    requires the Muslims to strive hard and pursue the means that lead to that. 

    Some people misunderstand the ahaadeeth that have been 
    narrated about the emergence of the Mahdi and the descent of the Messiah 
    ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him), so they are passive and do not strive, 
    and they sit and wait for the Mahdi to appear or the Messiah to come down, 
    and they do not call people to Allaah or strive to make the word of Allaah 
    supreme. But Allaah and His Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) have commanded us to take the appropriate means and strive hard on 
    earth. 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Take 
    your precautions, and either go forth (on an expedition) in parties, or go 
    forth all together”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:71]

    “And make ready against them all you can of power, 
    including steeds of war (tanks, planes, missiles, artillery) to threaten the 
    enemy of Allaah and your enemy”
    [al-Anfaal 8:60]

    “He it is Who has made the earth subservient to you (i.e. 
    easy for you to walk, to live and to do agriculture on it); so walk in the 
    path thereof and eat of His provision. And to Him will be the Resurrection”

    [al-Mulk 67:15] 

    “and for this let (all) those strive who want to strive”

    [al-Mutaffifeen 83:26] 

    “For the like of this let the workers work”

    [al-Saaffaat 37:61] 

    “And whoever desires the Hereafter and strives for it, 
    with the necessary effort due for it (i.e. does righteous deeds of Allaah’s 
    obedience) while he is a believer (in the Oneness of Allaah 
     
    Islamic Monotheism) — then such are the ones whose striving shall be 
    appreciated, (thanked and rewarded by Allaah)”
    [al-Isra’ 17:19] 

    “And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the 
    best provision is At-Taqwa (piety, righteousness)”

    [al-Baqarah 2:197]

    Allaah commanded Maryam to take the appropriate means when 
    she was at her weakest, as He said (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And shake the trunk of date palm towards you, it will let 
    fall fresh ripe dates upon you”

    [Maryam 19:25]

    The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) used to prepare for everything and draw up plans, as happened 
    during the Hijrah (migration to Madeenah). He prepared the mounts and a 
    guide, and he chose a travelling companion, and chose a place to hide until 
    the search for him had died down, and he protected all of that with secrecy. 
    This is how he conducted himself in all his battles and military campaigns, 
    and this is how he trained his companions. They used to meet their enemies 
    equipped with all kinds of weapons. The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) entered Makkah (at the conquest) with a 
    helmet on his head, even though Allaah said (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“Allaah will protect you from mankind”

    [al-Maa’idah 5:67]

    When he traveled for jihad or Hajj or ‘Umrah, he took his 
    provisions and more with him. 

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “Strive for that which will benefit you and seek the help of Allaah, 
    and do not feel helpless.” Narrated by Muslim, 2664. 

    We can imagine the state in which the call and the ummah 
    would have ended up if the previous generations had responded to the calls 
    to give up until the Mahdi comes. Would they have been able to defeat the 
    Tatars and Crusaders, and conquer Constantinople?  

    This mistaken understanding of the shar’i texts that have 
    been narrated concerning the Mahdi and the Messiah (peace be upon him) has 
    been criticized by many scholars, daa’iyahs and writers. 

    Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    It is not permissible for the Muslims to give up working for 
    Islam and for the establishment of the Islamic state on earth because they 
    are waiting for the Mahdi and the descent of ‘Eesa (peace be upon them 
    both), because they feel despair or they think that it is not possible to 
    achieve any such thing before they come. This is a false and desperate 
    notion. Neither Allaah nor His Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) told us that Islam will not regain power on earth before their 
    time. It is possible that that may be achieved before then if the Muslims 
    avail themselves of the means that lead to that, because Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “If you help (in the cause of) Allaah, He will help you, 
    and make your foothold firm”

    [Muhammad 47:7] 

    “Verily, Allaah will help those who help His (Cause)”

    [al-Hajj 22:40]

    We have to believe in the ahaadeeth which speak of the 
    descent of Eesa (peace be upon him) etc, and reject the false notions of 
    those who say that we should not work and strive and prepare to do that 
    which must be done at all times and in all places. End quote. 

    Professor ‘Abd al-‘Azeez Mustafa said: 

    Jihaad against the kuffaar, no matter who they are, where 
    they are or in what time they exist is obligatory according to sharee’ah; 
    this ruling has not been abrogated. This is an established truth of Islam. 
    This jihad is obligatory when its conditions are met and the relevant 
    rulings apply. It is not one of these conditions or rulings that jihad 
    should be delayed until what is promised comes to pass. This is not the way 
    in which the first Muslims understood it and how they acted. Indeed, when 
    they were told that Allaah would destroy the power of Chosroes with their 
    swords they did not stay in their houses waiting for the news to come true 
    and for that event to happen without any effort on their part. No, rather 
    they prepared themselves for that and made themselves ready until victory 
    came and thus the promise coincided with the decree of Allaah. But some of 
    the Muslims nowadays say no: jihad against the Jews must wait until the 
    Dajjaal appears. Perhaps this is part of the trial (fitnah) of the Dajjaal 
    in this world. 

    This negative talk has affected some of the Muslim youth, so 
    they do not feel any kind of responsibility towards al-Masjid al-Aqsa, the 
    environs of which Allaah has blessed. It has even led many of them to 
    believe more foolish ideas, namely that the Islamic state and the caliphate 
    will not be established until the Mahdi comes. 
I wonder about those who 
    propagate such ideas. It is as if they are saying to the Jews: Be harsh 
    towards your enemies… and to the Christians: Carry on with your aggression… 
    and to the Muslims: carry on being fragmented and disputing and being 
    useless until the Mahdi comes to you. I do not know on what their argument 
    is based, or how they imagine that the Mahdi will come to people who are 
    doing nothing or will support people who are apathetic. End quote.

He performed ‘Umrah from al-Hudaybiyah or at the time of al-Hudaybiyah in Dhu’l-Qi’dah; (he did) ‘Umrah the following year in Dhu’l-Qi’dah; and (he did) ‘Umrah from Ja’rranah when he shared out the booty of Hunayn in Dhu’l-Qi’dah. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, al-Hajj, 1654; Muslim, al-Hajj, 1253)
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
“He did ‘Umrah four times after the Hijrah, four ‘Umrahs, all of them in Dhu’l-Qi’dah. 
The first was the ‘Umrah of al-Hudaybiyah, which was the first of them, in 6 AH, but the mushrikin prevented him from reaching the House (the Ka’bah), so he offered the sacrifice (of camels) when his way was blocked at al-Hudaybiyah, and he and his Companions shaved their heads and exited the state of ihram, and went back in the same year to Madinah. 
The second was the Fulfilled ‘Umrah in the following year, when he entered Makkah and stayed there for three (days), then he left after completing his ‘Umrah . 
The third was the ‘Umrah which he did along with his Hajj. 
The fourth was his ‘Umrah from al-Ja’rranah, when he went out to Hunayn then he came back to Makkah and performed ‘Umrah from al-Ja’rranah. 
He said: there is no (scholarly) dispute concerning the fact that he did no more than four ‘Umrahs.” (Zad al-Ma’ad, vol. 2, p. 90-93) 
Al-Nawawi said: 
“The scholars said:  the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) performed these ‘Umrahs in Dhu’l-Qid’ah because of the virtue of this month and in order to go against the (ways of) Jahiliyyah. They used to think that this (i.e., doing ‘Umrah in Dhu’l-Qi’dah) was one of the most evil of evil actions, as stated above. 
So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did that several times in this month as this was the most eloquent way of explaining that it was permissible and of demonstrating the beliefs of Jahiliyyah to be false.” (Sharh Muslim, 8/235)

21223,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21223,She wants to give up prayer as she feels shy before Allaah because she is committing zina,"I know that zina is an immoral and evil action, and I feel too shy to stand before Allaah in prayer after doing ghusl for janaabah because of engaging in zina (unlawful sexual relations). I ask Allaah for forgiveness. Believe me, I do not feel happy and content in myself because of what I am doing, but I am trying to soothe my conscience. Should I go back to praying or not, whilst continuing to commit zina?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly zina is one of the major sins, one of the worst crimes, one of the most evil and immoral of actions. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a Faahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits: a great sin, and an evil way that leads one to hell unless Allaah Forgives him)”
[al-Isra’ 17:32] 
“And those who invoke not any other ilaah (god) along with Allaah, nor kill such person as Allaah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.
The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace”
[al-Furqaan 25:68-69]
Hence Allaah decrees a severe punishment in this world for those who commit zina, namely the hadd punishment. Allaah says, describing the punishment for the unmarried person who commits zina:
“The fornicatress and the fornicator, flog each of them with a hundred stripes. Let not pity withhold you in their case, in a punishment prescribed by Allaah, if you believe in Allaah and the Last Day. And let a party of the believers witness their punishment.”
[al-Noor 24:2 – interpretation of the meaning]
But for the muhsan (one who is or has been married) who commits zina, the punishment is execution. It says in the hadeeth narrated by Imam Muslim in his Saheeh that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If a previously-married man (commits zina) with a previously-married woman, (the punishment is) one hundred lashes and stoning.” (al-Hudood 3199). 
Because of the abhorrence and obscenity of this action, even the monkeys are offended by it, and they carried out the hadd punishment of stoning on a monkey which committed zina, as was narrated in Saheeh al-Bukhaari from ‘Amr ibn Maymoon who said: “During the Jaahiliyyah I saw a monkey which had committed zina, so the other monkeys got together and stoned it, and I stoned it with them.” (al-Manaaqib, 5360). 
How can an adult, accountable Muslim whom Allaah has honored with Islam be content to stoop to the level of animals and beasts which, whenever their desire is provoked, they satisfy it however they want? The seriousness of this sin is not limited to punishment in this world only, rather the punishment in the Hereafter is far greater and far worse. According to a hadeeth narrated by Imam al-Bukhaari from Samurah ibn Jundub, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Two (angels) came to me last night, woke me up and set out with me… until we came to something like a tannoor (clay oven), in which there was shouting and voices. We looked inside and saw naked men and women, towards whom flames came from beneath them. When the flames reached them, they cried out. I said to them [the two angels], ‘Who are these people?’… They told me, ‘As for the men and women in the structure like a tannoor oven, they are the adulterers and adulteresses…’” (6525).  
If a person dies committing this sin, what will be his situation? What will he say to his Lord when he stands before Him for judgement?? Is this the way to give thanks for the never-ending, innumerable blessings of Allaah? Is this the way to give thanks for the blessings of good health?  Do you think that Allaah does not see you when you are committing this great sin? Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Truly, nothing is hidden from Allaah, in the earth or in the heaven”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:5]
Do you not know that these physical faculties with which you are disobeying your Creator will testify against you on the Day of Resurrection? Have you not heard the words of the Compeller (al-Jabbaar): 
“Till, when they reach it (Hell-fire), their hearing (ears) and their eyes and their skins will testify against them as to what they used to do.
And they will say to their skins, ‘Why do you testify against us?’ They will say: ‘Allaah has caused us to speak.’ He causes all things to speak, and He created you the first time, and to Him you are made to return”
[Fussilat 41:20-21 – interpretation of the meaning]?
So our answer is that you must hasten to repent sincerely from this great sin, regret deeply what you have done, immediately give it up and give up everything that may lead to it. The causes of zina include the following: 
 1 – Unveiling and wanton display by uncovering the face, hair or any part of the body. It was narrated in the hadeeth that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There are two types of the people of Hell whom I have not seen… Women who are clothed yet naked, who have gone astray and try to lead others astray also. Their heads look like the humps of camels, leaning to one side. They will never enter Paradise nor even smell its fragrance, although its fragrance may be detected from such and such a distance.” (Narrated by Imam Muslim, al-Libaas wa’l-Zeenah, 3971). 
2 – Being alone with a man who is not a mahram for you, because the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No man should be alone with a (non-mahram) woman unless her mahram is present.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3842). 
3 – Beware of mixing with those whom you are not permitted to mix with, for zina only happens as a result of that. You must pay attention to your conscience and do not pay attention to the whispers of the Shaytaan when he tries to make zina look attractive and to make this crime seem insignificant. The Shaytaan has sworn by Allaah’s Glory that he will mislead the sons of Adam. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“[Iblees (Satan)] said: ‘By Your Might, then I will surely, mislead them all,
Except Your chosen slaves amongst them (i.e. faithful, obedient, true believers of Islamic Monotheism)’”
[Saad 38:82]
The Shaytaan has gained a victory over you in this way, but he will not stop at making you fall into this sin, rather he is striving to make sure that you will abide in Hell for eternity – we seek refuge with Allaah from that – by making the idea of giving up prayer on the basis of this false reasoning seem attractive to you. 
Because giving up prayer constitutes kufr or disbelief in Allaah. In Saheeh Muslim it is narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah said: “I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, ‘Between a man and kufr and shirk there stands his giving up prayer.’” (al-Eemaan, 116). And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The covenant that differentiates us from them is prayer; whoever gives it up is a kaafir.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, al-Eemaan, 2545; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 2113) 
So you have to pray a great deal for forgiveness, repent and make du’aa’. You have to pray regularly and pray a great deal, and strive to be humble and focused in prayer, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah). Verily, As-Salaah (the prayer) prevents from Al-Fahshaa’ (i.e. great sins of every kind, unlawful sexual intercourse) and Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism, and every kind of evil wicked deed)”
[al-‘Ankaboot 29:45] 
“And perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as- Salaah), at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night [i.e. the five compulsory Salaah (prayers)]. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds (i.e. small sins)”
[Hood 11:114]
You should not think that repentance is too difficult or feel that Allaah will never accept your repentance, for the Shaytaan is keen to sow the seeds of despair in your heart. 
You should note that whoever repents, Allaah will accept his repentance and change his bad deeds into good deeds. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And whosoever repents and does righteous good deeds; then verily, he repents towards Allaah with true repentance”
[al-Furqaan 25:71]
The gate of repentance is open, and no one can stand between you and repentance. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah will accept the repentance of His slave so long as the death rattle has not yet reached his throat.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, al-Da’waat, 3460; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 2802). 
Allaah rejoices over this repentance. According to a hadeeth narrated by Imam Muslim in his Saheeh from Anas ibn Maalik, the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah rejoices over the repentance of His slave when he repents more than any one of you would rejoice if he were travelling in the wilderness and his camel which was carrying his food and drink wandered off, and he despaired of ever finding it, then he comes to a tree and lies down in its shade, thinking that he will never see his camel again, then whilst he is like that he sees it standing next to him, so he seizes its reins and says, ‘O Allaah, You are my slave and I am Your Lord!’ making this mistake because he is so happy.” (Baab al-Tawbah, 4932). 
Finally, after you have repented you must cut off all the routes that may lead to evil, by means of the way prescribed in sharee’ah which Allaah has permitted, namely marriage. You should note that it is not permissible for a Muslim man or woman to marry a person who has committed zina unless he or she repents to Allaah. If he repents and gives up this sin, then it is permissible for you to marry him after he repents. Please see questions no. 11195 and 2627.

I hope that you can tell me of a soorah from the Qur’aan that I can recite, or a du’aa’ that will help me not to think too much about the future and having children, because I am suffering a great deal because of not getting married. There is someone else in the family who is a year older than me and has not yet gotten married either. Please advise me, may Allaah reward you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.First of all, before answering this question I would like to point out that all matters are in the hand of Allaah; no benefit comes and no harm is warded off except by His help. The One Who relieves distress is Allaah, so if anything befalls a person he must turn to Allaah and beseech Him and call upon Him, whether that has to do with attaining something desired or removing something disliked. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whatever of blessings and good things you have, it is from Allaah. Then, when harm touches you, unto Him you cry aloud for help”
[al-Nahl 16:53] 
“Is not He (better than your gods) Who responds to the distressed one, when he calls on Him, and Who removes the evil, and makes you inheritors of the earth, generations after generations? Is there any ilaah (god) with Allaah? Little is that you remember!”
[al-Naml 27:62]
Allaah is the One to Whom the slave turns. When a person turns to Him with sincerity and humility, acknowledging his need for Him, and his food, drink, clothing and shelter are all good (i.e., from halaal sources), then he may expect Allaah to respond. This applies to all kinds of du’aa’. 
Then we should note that if a person calls upon Allaah and He does not respond, then either Allaah is storing that up for him [for the Hereafter], or He is warding off from him some evil that is greater than what was asked for. But he should not despair and give up calling upon Allaah, for Allaah loves those who persist in du’aa’ and who await His response with certain faith. For Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor)”
[al-Baqarah 2:186]
He should seek out the times when prayer is answered. One of these times is the last third of the night. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Our Lord descends to the lowest heaven when there is one third of the night left, and He says, ‘Who will call upon Me, that I may answer? Who will ask of Me, that I may give to him? Who will seek My forgiveness, that I may forgive him?’ – until the dawn comes.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7494; Muslim, 758) 
Similarly: “The last hour of Friday – there is no Muslim slave who stands and prays and calls upon Allaah at that time, but Allaah will grant that to him.” (narrated by al-Bukhaari, 935; Muslim, 852) 
Or from the time when the imaam comes out on Friday until the prayer ends. 
Another of these times is the interval between the adhaan and iqaamah, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Du’aa’ made between the adhaan and iqaamah will not be refused.” (narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 212; Abu Dawood, 521; Ahmad, 3/119. al-Tirmidhi said, (it is) a saheeh hasan hadeeth). 
Among the situations (when du’aa’ is answered) is when a person is prostrating. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “With regard to sujood, offer lots of du’aa’ then, for it is more likely that you will receive a response.” (Narrated by Muslim, 479). Another occasion is after saying the final tashahhud (in prayer) and before saying the salaam. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Then let him say whatever du’aa’ he wants.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim). 
This is what I wanted to say before answering this specific question. 
With regard to the answer to this particular question, this woman has to have patience and seek reward with Allaah. She should realize that all matters are in the hand of Allaah and that the delay in getting married may be better for her and it may ultimately lead to something good that Allaah has prepared for her. She should be optimistic and expect good things to happen. If you feel some distress or waswaas (insinuating whispers from the Shaytaan), then increase your dhikr (remembrance of Allaah), seek refuge in Allaah from the accursed Shaytaan, and focus on  worship and other good deeds, until your distress is eased. 
Also, pray the well known du’aa’ for relief of anxiety and distress (“Allaahumma inni ‘abduka ibnu ‘abdika ibnu ‘amatika, naasiyati bi yadika maadin fiyya hukmuka (O Allaah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave and son of Your maidservant. My forelock is in Your hand. Your command over me is forever executed…)”). A woman should say, “Allaahumma inni amatuka bintu ‘abdika bintu amatika naasiyati bi yadika maadin fiyya hukmuka, ‘adlun fiyya qadaa’uka. As’aluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw anzaltahu fi kitaabika aw ‘allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw ista’tharta bihi fi ‘ilm il-ghaybi ‘indaka an taj’al al-Qur’aan al-‘azeem rabee’a qalbi, wa noora sadri wa jalaa’a huzni wa dhahaaba hammi (O Allaah, I am Your maidservant, daughter of Your slave, daughter of Your maidservant. My forelock is in Your hand. You command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You which You have named Yourself with, or revealed in Your Book, or You have taught to any of Your creation, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the unseen with You, that You make the Holy Qur’aan the life of my heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety).”

21239,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21239,Rulings on ja’aalah (price offered),Could you give us a brief description of the rulings on ja’aalah?,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is also called ja’l and ja’eelah. This refers to what 
          a person is given for something that he does, such as saying, “Whoever 
          does such and such, will get such and such money,” i.e., a certain amount 
          of money is given to the one who does a certain job for him, such as 
          building a wall.
The evidence that this is permitted is the aayah (interpretation 
          of the meaning):
“They said: ‘We have lost the (golden) bowl 
          of the king and for him who produces it is (the reward of) a camel load; 
          and I will be bound by it’”
[Yoosuf 12:72]
i.e., whoever could tell them who had stolen the king’s 
          bowl would be given a camel’s load [of goods]. This is the ja’l (reward 
          or price), so the aayah indicates that the ja’aalah is permissible.
The evidence for it in the Sunnah is the hadeeth of the 
          one who was stung, which was narrated in al-Saheehayn and elsewhere 
          from the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed, (which said that) they stopped near 
          one of the tribes of the Arabs, and asked them for hospitality, but 
          they refused. Then the chief of that tribe was stung, and they tried 
          everything to help him. Then they came to them [the group of Sahaabah] 
          and asked them, “Can any one of you do something?” One of them said, 
          “By Allaah, I can do ruqyah [an incantation for healing], but by Allaah, 
          we asked you for hospitality and you did not grant it to us, so I will 
          not do ruqyah for you until you agree a price with us (ja’l).” So they 
          agreed on a flock of sheep, then he started to blow on him and recite 
          “Al-hamdu-Lillaahi Rabb il-‘Aalameen” [i.e., al-Faatihah]. Then 
          it was as if he was released from a chain. So they gave them what they 
          had agreed (the ja’l) and they came to the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and told him about that. 
          He said, “You did the right thing. Share them out and give me a share 
          too.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, Kitaab al-Ijaarah, 2276).
Whoever does a job on which payment has been offered 
          after coming to know of the offer, deserves the payment, because the 
          contract is fulfilled when the work is completed. If the work is undertaken 
          by a group then the reward is to be shared out equally amongst them, 
          because they shared in the work for which the compensation is deserved, 
          so they should share in the reward. But if a person does the job before 
          knowing the amount to be offered for it, he does not deserve anything 
          because this is work for which he was not given permission, so he does 
          not deserve any reward. If he came to know of the offered amount during 
          the work, he should take the payment for what he did after coming to 
          know that.
The ja’aalah is a contract which either 
          party is allowed to cancel. If it is cancelled by the worker, then he 
          does not deserve any payment, because he has cancelled his right himself. 
          If it is cancelled by the one who offered to pay this price, and that 
          is done before work is started, then the worker deserves a reward equivalent 
          to what is usually paid for such work, because his work was done in 
          return for a reward that was not given to him. 
Ja’aalah differs from ordinary hiring in several ways:
1 – In order for it to be valid, it is not 
          essential to know what the work for which this price is agreed upon 
          entails. This is unlike hiring, in which case it is essential to know 
          what the work for which the wages are paid entails.
2 – In order for it to be valid, it is not essential 
          to know what the time of the work for which this price is agreed upon entails. This 
          is unlike hiring, in which case it is essential to know the time period 
          within which the work is to be done.
3 – In the case of ja’aalah, it is permissible to combine 
          the work and the time taken to complete it, such as saying, “Whoever 
          can sew this garment in a day will have such and such (payment).” Then 
          if he sews it in a day, he will have that payment and will deserve the 
          ja’l (announced payment), otherwise he will not. This is unlike hiring, 
          where it is not correct to combine the work and the time taken to complete 
          it.
4 – In the case of ja’aalah, the worker is not obliged 
          to complete the work, unlike hiring where the worker is committed to 
          the work once he agrees.
5 – The ja’aalah is a contract in which either party 
          may cancel it without the agreement of the other. This is unlike hiring 
          which is a binding contract, in which neither party may cancel without 
          the consent of the other.
The fuqaha (may Allaah have mercy on them) stated that 
          whoever does work for another without any agreement on price (ja’l) 
          or permission of the one for whom the job is done, does not deserve 
          anything, because he did some useful work without stipulating any payment, 
          so he does not deserve the payment, and because man cannot be bound 
          by something that he himself did not agree to. But there are two exceptions 
          from that:
(1)If the worker had prepared himself to do that work for 
          a fee, such as an agent or porter, etc. Then if he did some work with 
          permission, he deserves payment, because ‘urf (custom) indicates that. 
          But whoever had not prepared himself to do that work does not deserve 
          anything, even if he was given permission, except with conditions.
(2)Whoever saved another person’s possessions from being destroyed, 
          such as rescuing them from the sea or from fire, or who found them in 
          danger of being destroyed if he went away or left them. He should be 
          given the usual reward even if the owner did not give him permission 
          to do that, because there was the fear that the goods may be have been 
          destroyed or lost. Giving a reward also encourages such actions, namely 
          saving people’s property from destruction.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on 
          him) said: “Whoever saves another person’s wealth deserves the usual 
          reward, even if there is no agreement, according to the more correct 
          of the two opinions. This was the stated view of Ahmad and others.”
The great scholar Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy 
          on him) said: “Whoever does something to the property of another without 
          his permissionor does it to preserve or 
          protect the property for its owner from being lost, then the correct 
          view is that he should be given some payment in return for his action. 
          This was stated by Ahmad in a number of places.”",From al-Mulakhkhas al-Fiqhi by Shaykh Saalih ibn Fawzaan ibn ‘Abd-Allaah Aal Fawzaan

To be on the safe side, the Muslim should not omit saying Bismillah before wudu.","Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal’s view  on saying Bismillah before wudu


Views of the majority of scholars on saying Bismillah before wudu 


Contemporary scholars’ views on saying Bismillah before wudu","Praise be to Allah.Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal’s view  on saying Bismillah before wudu
The scholars differed concerning the ruling on saying Bismillah in wudu . 
Imam Ahmad was of the view that it is obligatory, and he quoted as evidence the hadith narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), according to which he said: “There is no wudu for the one who does not mention the name of Allah.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 25; classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi. See al-Mughni, 1/145) 
Views of the majority of scholars on saying Bismillah before wudu 
The majority of scholars – including Imam Abu Haneefah, Imam Malik and Imam al-Shafi'i – and according to one view narrated from Imam Ahmad, are of the view that saying Bismillah is one of the Sunnahs of wudu , and that it is not obligatory. 
They quoted evidence for its not being obligatory, such as: 
1 – The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught a man how to do wudu, and said to him: “Do wudu as Allah has commanded you.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 302; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 247). This is referring to the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! When you intend to offer ss-salah (the prayer), wash your faces and your hands (forearms) up to the elbows, rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads, and (wash) your feet up to the ankles” [al-Maidah 5:6]
And there is no mention of saying Bismillah in what Allah commands here. See al-Majmu’ by al-Nawawi, 1/346 
Abu Dawud (856) narrated a more complete version of this hadith, which more clearly demonstrates that it is not obligatory to say Bismillah when doing wudu . 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The prayer of any one of you is not complete unless he does wudu properly as enjoined by Allah. So he should wash his face and his hands up to the elbows, and wipe his head, and wash his feet up to the ankles…” 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not mention saying Bismillah, which indicates that it is not obligatory.  See al-Sunan al-Kubra by al-Bayhaqi, 1/44 
2 – Many of those who described the wudu of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not mention that he said Bismillah; if it was obligatory it would have been mentioned. (See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 1/130)
This is the view favoured by many of the Hanbalis such as al-Khiraqi and Ibn Qudamah. (See al-Mughni, 1/145; al-Insaf, 1/128)
Contemporary scholars’ views on saying Bismillah before wudu
Among contemporary scholars, this view was favoured by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim and Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allaah have mercy on them both). (See: Fatawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim, 2/39; al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 1/130, 300) 
They responded in two ways to the hadith which is quoted by those who say that saying Bismillah is obligatory: 
1 – That the hadith is da’if (weak). 
It was classed as da’if by a number of scholars including Imam Ahmad, al-Bayhaqi, al-Nawawi and all-Bazzar. 
Imam Ahmad was asked about saying Bismillah when doing wudu , and he said: There is no sound hadith concerning that, and I do not know of any hadith that has a jayyid (good) isnad to support that. Al-Mughni, 1/145 
See al-Sunan al-Kubra by al-Bayhaqi, 1/43; al-Majmu’, 1/343; Talkhis al-Habir, 1/72 
2 – If the hadith is sahih, then what it means is “no perfect wudu” and not “no valid wudu”. See al-Majmu’, 1/347; al-Mughni, 1/146 
Based on this, then the hadith – if it is sahih – indicates that it is mustahabb to say Bismillah, but it is not obligatory. And Allah knows best. 
Based on this, if a Muslim does wudu and does not say Bismillah, then his wudu is valid, but he is missing out on the reward for doing this Sunnah. To be on the safe side, the Muslim should not omit saying Bismillah when doing wudu.",Islam Q&A

I sometimes feel that he is kissing me with desire. What is the Shar`i ruling on his wudu?","If a man kisses his wife or touches her hand or hugs her but he does not emit anything, then his wudu is not invalidated and it remains as it is. But if madhiy or maniy come out of him as a result of kissing her, then his wudu is invalidated.",,"Praise be to Allah.`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) “kissed one of his wives then went out to pray, and he did not do wudu.’” (Abu Dawud, al-Taharah, 180, 179, 178; al-Tirmidhi, al-Taharah, 86; al-Nasai, al-Taharah, 1.104; Ibn Majah, al-Taharah, 502)
This hadith indicates the ruling on whether or not kissing and touching a woman invalidates wudu . The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differed concerning that. Some of them said that if you touch a woman , this invalidates wudu in all cases; some said that if you touch a woman with desire, it invalidates wudu, otherwise it does not. Some said that it does not invalidate wudu at all, and this is the correct view.
This means that if a man kisses his wife, or touches her hand or hugs her , but he does not emit anything, then his wudu is not invalidated and it remains as it is. That is because the basic principle is that wudu remains as it was, unless there is proof that it has been broken. 
There is nothing in the Book of Allah or the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to indicate that touching a woman invalidates wudu. On this basis, touching a woman, even with no barrier and even with desire, and kissing her or hugging her, does not invalidate wudu. (Fatawa al-Marah, Ibn ‘Uthaymin, p. 20) 
But if madhiy (prostatic fluid) or maniy (semen) come out of him as a result of kissing her, then his wudu is invalidated in that case.

As a result of this kind of custom, one of the sisters started to observe the obligatory fast of Ramadaan after she saw menstrual blood, although at that time she was thirteen years old and she already had pubic hair before she got her period, but she does not remember whether that hair was coarse or not, and she does not remember how many years she did not fast after that hair appeared.  My question is: 
1 – What are the signs of a woman’s puberty, according to sharee’ah or to custom? 
2 – What is the ruling on this sister’s not fasting during those Ramadaans when her hair had started to grow but she had not yet started her periods, if the custom on this issue is contrary to sharee’ah?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.A woman is deemed to have reached puberty when one of four things happens: 
1 – When she reaches the age of fifteen.
2 – When her pubic hair grows, which is hair around the private parts.

4 – When she starts to menstruate. 
If one of these four things happens, then she has reached the age of puberty and she is now regarded as accountable, and she is obliged to do acts of worship just like adults. If a woman did not know that puberty begins in this manner, then there is no sin on her for not fasting, because she was unaware, and there is no sin on the person who is unaware so long as he was not negligent about learning or finding out when he was able to do so. But she must hasten to make up the fasts that she missed because when a woman reaches the age of puberty, she becomes accountable and she must make up the fasts that she missed during the time when she was accountable. She must strive to work out how many days she missed after she reached puberty, and hasten to make them up so there will no longer be any sin on her.",Islam Q&A

I hope that you could explain that and give some examples of it.,"Kufr means “not believing in Allah and His Messenger, whether that is accompanied by denial or it is not accompanied by denial but rather doubt, or turning away from faith out of jealousy or arrogance, or because one is following whims and desires that prevent one from following the message.”","What is kufr? 


Kinds of major kufr which put one beyond the pale of Islam","Praise be to Allah.The reality of kufr and its various kinds is a lengthy topic, but we may sum it up in the following points: 
The importance of knowing what kufr is and the forms it may take
The texts of the Quran and Sunnah indicate that faith is not valid and is not accepted unless two conditions are met – which are what are implied by the testimony that there is no god except Allah. These two conditions are submission to Allah Alone (Tawhid ), and denouncing and shunning all kinds of kufr and shirk. 
A person cannot denounce or shun anything unless he knows what it is. From this we understand the importance of knowing what Tawhid is, so that we may act accordingly and attain Tawhid, and knowing what kufr and shirk are so that we may avoid them and steer clear of them. 
 What is kufr? 
Kufr in Arabic means covering and concealing something. 
In Shar`i terminology, kufr means “not believing in Allah and His Messenger, whether that is accompanied by denial or it is not accompanied by denial but rather doubt, or turning away from faith out of jealousy or arrogance, or because one is following whims and desires that prevent one from following the message. 
So, kufr is the attribute of everyone who rejects something that Allah has commanded us to believe in, after news of that has reached him, whether he rejects it in his heart without uttering it, or he speaks those words of rejection without believing it in his heart, or he does both; or he does an action which is described in the texts as putting one beyond the pale of faith.” (See Majmu’ al-Fatawa by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, 12/335; al-Ihkam fi Usul al-Ahkam by Ibn Hazam, 1/45) 
Ibn Hazam said in his book al-Fisal: 
“Rejecting something for which there is sound proof that there can be no faith without believing in it is kufr, and uttering words for which there is proof that uttering them is kufr is kufr. Doing any action for which there is proof that it is kufr is also kufr.” 
Kinds of major kufr which put one beyond the pale of Islam 
The scholars divided kufr into a number of categories , under which they listed many forms and kinds of shirk. These are as follows: 

The kufr of denial and rejection. This kufr may sometimes take the form of disbelief in the heart – which occurs rarely among the kuffar, as Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said – and sometimes it takes the form of outward or apparent rejection, which means concealing the truth and not submitting to it outwardly, whilst recognizing it and knowing it inwardly, such as the Jews’ rejection of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Allah says of them (interpretation of the meaning): 

“then when there came to them that which they had recognised, they disbelieved in it” [al-Baqarah 2:89] 
He also said (interpretation of the meaning]: 
“But verily, a party of them conceal the truth while they know it” [al-Baqarah 2:146] 
That is because rejection only happens when a person knows the truth and refuses it. Hence Allah stated that the kuffar’s disbelief in the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was not disbelief in the true sense of the word, because their disbelief was only outward and verbal, and inwardly they recognized the truth. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“it is not you that they deny, but it is the Verses (the Quran) of Allah that the Zalimun (polytheists and wrongdoers) deny.” [al-An’am 6:33] 
“And they belied them (those Ayat) wrongfully and arrogantly, though their own selves were convinced thereof.” [al-Naml 27:14] 
Similar to this is the kufr of permitting that which is forbidden. Whoever regards as permissible something which he knows that Islam has forbidden has disbelieved in the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and in that which he brought. The same applies to one who forbids something which he knows that Islam has permitted. 

The kufr of turning away in arrogance, such as the kufr of Iblis of whom Allah said: 

“… except Iblis (Satan), he refused and was proud and was one of the disbelievers (disobedient to Allah)” [al-Baqarah 2:34 – interpretation of the meaning] 
And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They (hypocrites) say: ‘We have believed in Allah and in the Messenger (Muhammad), and we obey,’ then a party of them turn away thereafter, such are not believers” [al-Nur 24:47] 
So Allah has stated that those who do not act in accordance with faith are not believers, even if they utter the words of faith. The kufr of turning away means that one ignores the truth and does not learn it or act in accordance with it, whether it is the matter of words, actions or beliefs. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But those who disbelieve, turn away from that whereof they are warned” [al-Ahqaf 46:3] 
Whoever turns away verbally from that which the Messenger has brought is like one who says “I will not follow him.” The one who turns away by his actions is like one who runs away from hearing the truth which he brought, or puts his fingers in his ears so as not to hear, or who hears it but turns away in his heart and refuses to believe, and who refuses to act upon it. He has disbelieved in the sense of the kufr of turning away. 

The kufr of hypocrisy. This takes the form of not believing in the heart and not acting, whilst submitting outwardly in order to show off to people. This is like the kufr of Ibn Salul and the other munafiqin (hypocrites) of whom Allah said (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And of mankind, there are some (hypocrites) who say: ‘We believe in Allah and the Last Day,’ while in fact they believe not. They (think to) deceive Allah and those who believe, while they only deceive themselves, and perceive (it) not! In their hearts is a disease (of doubt and hypocrisy) and Allah has increased their disease. A painful torment is theirs because they used to tell lies. And when it is said to them: ‘Make not mischief on the earth,’ they say: ‘We are only peacemakers.’ Verily, they are the ones who make mischief, but they perceive not. And when it is said to them (hypocrites): ‘Believe as the people (followers of Muhammad, Al-Ansar and Al-Muhajirun) have believed,’ they say: ‘Shall we believe as the fools have believed?’ Verily, they are the fools, but they know not. And when they meet those who believe, they say: ‘We believe,’ but when they are alone with their Shayatin (devils — polytheists, hypocrites), they say: ‘Truly, we are with you; verily, we were but mocking.’ Allah mocks them and gives them increase in their wrong-doing to wander blindly. These are they who have purchased error for guidance, so their commerce was profitless. And they were not guided. Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindled a fire; then, when it lighted all around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness. (So) they could not see. They are deaf, dumb, and blind, so they return not (to the Right Path). Or like a rainstorm from the sky, wherein is darkness, thunder, and lightning. They thrust their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunderclap for fear of death. But Allah ever encompasses the disbelievers (i.e. Allah will gather them all together).
The lightning almost snatches away their sight, whenever it flashes for them, they walk therein, and when darkness covers them, they stand still. And if Allah willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. Certainly, Allah has power over all things” [al-Baqarah 2:8-20]  

The kufr of doubt , which means hesitating with regard to following the truth and being uncertain as to whether it is true, because what is required is certainty of faith (yaqin) that what the Messenger brought is truth with no hint of doubt in it. Whoever thinks that what he brought may not be true has disbelieved, in the sense of kufr of doubt, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And he went into his garden while in a state (of pride and disbelief), unjust to himself. He said: ‘I think not that this will ever perish.  And I think not the Hour will ever come, and if indeed I am brought back to my Lord, (on the Day of Resurrection), surely, I shall find better than this when I return to Him.’ His companion said to him during the talk with him: ‘Do you disbelieve in Him Who created you out of dust (i.e. your father Adam), then out of Nutfah (mixed semen drops of male and female discharge), then fashioned you into a man? But as for my part, (I believe) that He is Allah, my Lord, and none shall I associate as partner with my Lord.’” [al-Kahf 18:35-38]  
From this we may conclude that kufr – which is the opposite of iman or faith – may take the form of feelings in the heart, such as hating Allah or His signs, or His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him); this contradicts love and faith which support the actions of the heart. Kufr may also take the form of spoken words, such as insulting Allah, or it may be an outward action, such as prostrating to idols, or offering sacrifices to someone other than Allah. Just as faith takes the form of actions of the heart, words on the tongue and outward physical actions, so too kufr may take the form of actions of the heart, words on the tongue and outward physical actions. We ask Allah to keep us safe from kufr and its branches, and to increase us in faith and make us guided and cause us to guide others… Ameen.

But if it is not necessary then it is not permitted., rather it is forbidden to file the teeth or make gaps between them for the purpose of beautification, and there is a strong warning against doing so because it is a kind of messing about and altering the creation of Allaah. 
But if this is done for the purpose of medical treatment, or to remove a deformity or for some other need, such as when a person is unable to eat unless his teeth are corrected, then there is nothing wrong with that.

If the answer is that (the one who does not stay in Mina) is obliged to offer a sacrifice, then should he offer a sheep for each night or is one sufficient?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Staying overnight in Mina during the Days of Tashreeq is obligatory according to the majority of fuqahaa’; the one who fails to do that with no excuse is obliged to offer a sacrifice. According to the majority of scholars one should stay there for most of the night.
(al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, part 17, p. 58).
Not staying overnight in Mina during the Days of Tashreeq may be one of the following cases:
The first case: when a person does not stay overnight in Mina because he has an excuse.
Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked about the ruling on a person who does not stay overnight in Mina during the Days of Tashreeq. He said: “He is not obliged to offer any sacrifice because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can’ [al-Taghaabun 64:16] – whether he did not stay overnight at Mina because of sickness or because there was no room, of for some similar legitimate excuse such as those who bring water to the pilgrims and those who tend sheep, and whatever else comes under the same rulings.
The second case: when a person does not stay overnight (in Mina) during the days of Tahsreeq with no excuse.
The Shaykh (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:
Whoever does not stay overnight in Mina during the Days of Tashreeq with no excuse has failed to do something which was prescribed by the Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in both word and deed, and by the fact that he made a concession for some of those who have excuses such as shepherds and those who bring water to the pilgrims. Concessions can only be made when there is something which has to be done. Hence staying overnight in Mina during the Days of Tashreeq is considered to be one of the obligatory duties of Hajj, according to the more correct of the two scholarly views, and whoever does not do that and has no legitimate excuse has to offer a sacrifice, because it was reported that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: “Whoever fails to do one of the rituals [of Hajj] or forgets it, let him offer a sacrifice.” It is sufficient to offer one sacrifice for not staying overnight in Mina during the days of Tashreeq.”
(Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz – may Allaah have mercy on him – vol. 5, p. 182)

          previous tawaaf is valid and the ruling on that is the same as one who

21271,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21271,"Why is the legacy mentioned first in the aayah, “after payment of legacies that you may have bequeathed or debts” [al-Nisa’ 4:12]?","Why is the word wasiyah (legacy, will, bequest) mentioned in the Qur’an before the word dayn (debt?) when we know that the debt must be paid off before the legacy is given?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: “What is the reason why the legacy is mentioned 
    before the debt, when the debt takes precedence according to scholarly 
    consensus, i.e., the debts of the deceased must be paid off from his estate 
    before his will is executed… this may be answered in five ways: 

    1 – What is meant is that 
    these two issues take precedence over the issue of inheritance, and the 
    order in which they are mentioned is not indicative of which one is more 
    important. Hence the bequest was mentioned first. 

    2 – Because the legacy is 
    less binding than debt, it is mentioned first to show that it is 
    nevertheless important, as when Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “What 
    sort of Book is this that leaves neither a small thing nor a big thing…”

    [al-Kahf 18:49]

    … 

    4 – The legacy is mentioned first because it is the share of 
    the poor and needy, and the debt is mentioned second because it is the share 
    of the lender who can seek it with force and who has a strong argument to 
    support his case. 

    5 – Because the legacy is something that is initiated by the 
    person, it is mentioned first, whereas the debt is something that is well 
    established and clear whether he mentioned it or not. 

    See al-Jaami’ li Ahkaam al-Qur’aan by al-Qurtubi, vol. 
    5, p. 74. 

    Some scholars added two extra points: 

    “The legacy is mentioned first because the legacy is an act 
    of kindness and upholding family ties, unlike the debt which usually results 
    from a kind of neglect. So the phrase starts with the legacy because it is 
    of greater virtue.

    And it was said that the legacy is mentioned first because it 
    is something that is given for nothing in return, whereas the debt is given 
    in return for something. So payment of the legacy is harder for the heirs 
    than payment of the debt, and paying the legacy may be thought of as a form 
    of waste, unlike the debt which the heir will pay with condifence.”

          Every Muslim must fear Allaah and show respect towards 
          Him. When he stands in prayer before Allaah, he must stand in a manner 
          of humility and submission to Allaah, keeping far away from everything 
          that may corrupt or invalidate his prayer, distract his mind, or keep 
          him from focusing on the prayer. He must avoid anything that goes against 
          respect and good manners. 
 
          For a worshipper to have chewing gum in his mouth is 
          undoubtedly incompatible with fear and respect of Allaah, and with humility 
          before Him. It causes a lot of movement in the mouth.
 
          With regard to the ruling on having chewing gum in one’s 
          mouth when praying:
Ibn Qudaamah said: 
          If he has anything in his mouth that can dissolve, such as sugar, and 
          any part of it dissolves, and he swallows it, then his prayer is invalidated, 
          because he has eaten.
 
          (al-Mughni, part 1, p. 400)
According to the Hanafis, 
          Maaliks and Hanbalis, it is also makrooh to put anything in his mouth 
          even if that does not prevent him from reciting, because that distracts 
          his mind. The Hanafis stated that if this thing does not dissolve then 
          it is makrooh; if it does dissolve, such as sugar in his mouth, then 
          this invalidates his prayer if he swallows it after it has dissolved.
 
          (al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, part 27, p. 117)
 
          And they stated that if he has sugar in his mouth, and 
          it dissolves and he swallows it deliberately, knowing that that is forbidden, 
          or because he did not make any effort to learn, then his prayer is invalid. 
          They also stated that his prayer becomes invalid if he chews it, if 
          it is a lot, even if nothing reaches his stomach.
 
          Al-Majd said: if he brings out something substantial 
          that is between his teeth and swallows it, then his prayer becomes invalid 
          in our view. They stated that swallowing something that has dissolved, 
          such as sugar, is like eating.

Similarly, there are some people for whom nothing but poverty is good, and if Allaah made such a person rich it would be harmful for him; and there are others for whom nothing but richness is appropriate, and if they became poor that would be harmful to them. 
Some women wished that they could be men who would fight in the way of Allaah. This was just wishful thinking, but Allaah revealed the prohibition of that wishful thinking in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
