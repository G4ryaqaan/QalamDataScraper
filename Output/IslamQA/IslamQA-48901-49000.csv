48952,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/48952,Can a woman donate any of her money without her husband’s permission?,"I want to help my family, my father, mother and siblings, by giving them some money. I work and I have a lot of money, alhamdulillah. I am able to help them, but my husband will not let me. What should I do?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If your family (your father, mother and siblings) are poor 
    and you are able to spend on them, then you are obliged to do so, and it is 
    not permissible for you to obey your husband and not spend on them. 

    See Question no. 44995. 

    Secondly: 

    If your spending on your family is done on a voluntary basis, 
    i.e., they are not in need of this money, rather you want to treat them 
    kindly and uphold the ties of kinship by giving this money, then the 
    scholars differed concerning the ruling on a woman donating some of her 
    wealth voluntarily without her husband’s permission. 

    The majority of scholars are of the view that the wife cannot 
    be stopped from donating some of her wealth; she has the right to dispose of 
    it as she wishes without her husband’s permission. They quoted several texts 
    as evidence, such as the following: 

    1 – The proven report that Umm al-Mu’mineen Maymoonah bint 
    al-Haarith (may Allaah be pleased with her) freed a slave woman and she did 
    not ask the permission of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him). When it was her day for the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) to stay with her, she said: “Did you 
    notice, O Messenger of Allaah, that I freed my slave woman?” He said: “Did 
    you?” She said: “Yes.” He said: “If you had given her to your maternal 
    uncles you would have earned a greater reward.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 
    2592; Muslim, 999. 

    Al-Nawawi said: 

    This shows that it is permissible for a woman to dispose of 
    her wealth voluntarily without her husband’s permission. 

    2 – al-Bukhaari (978) and Muslim (885) narrated that Jaabir 
    ibn ‘Abd-Allaah said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) stood up on the day of al-Fitr and led the people in prayer. He 
    started with the prayer then he delivered the khutbah (sermon). When he had 
    finished he came down and came to the woman and exhorted them, leaning on 
    Bilaal’s arm, and Bilaal was spreading out his cloak for the woman to throw 
    their sadaqah (charity) into it. According to another report: they started 
    to give their jewellery in charity. 

    Al-Haafiz said: 

    This hadeeth shows that a woman may give her wealth in 
    charity without her husband’s permission. 

    Al-Nawawi said: 

    This hadeeth shows that it is permissible for a woman to give 
    some of her wealth in charity without her husband’s permission and that this 
    is not limited to one-third of her wealth. This is our view and the view of 
    the majority. Maalik said: It is not permissible for her to give more than 
    one-third of her wealth except with her husband’s permission. Our evidence 
    for that from the hadeeth is the fact that the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not ask them whether they had their 
    husbands for permission, or whether they were giving more than one-third. If 
    the ruling had differed he would have asked them. 

    Some of the scholars are of the view that a woman should not 
    donate any of her wealth except with her husband’s permission. They quoted 
    as evidence the words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him): “It is not permissible for a women to give anything except with 
    her husband’s permission.” Narrated by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad, 
    6643; Abu Dawood, 3547; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abu 
    Dawood. 

    The majority of scholars interpreted this hadeeth as 
    referring to a foolish woman who does not handle money properly, or as 
    meaning that it is mustahabb for a woman to ask her husband’s permission, 
    not that it is obligatory, and that this is part of good manners. 

    Al-Khattaabi said: 
According to the 
    majority of fuqaha’, this is part of good manners and making the husband 
    feel good, but that only applies in the case of a woman who is not wise or 
    mature. It was proven that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) said to the women, “Give charity,” and they started 
    to throw their earrings and rings and Bilaal caught them in his cloak, and 
    these gifts were given without their husbands’ permission. 

    Al-Shawkaani said in Nayl al-Awtaar (3/414): 

    This hadeeth has been quoted as proof that it is not 
    permissible for a woman to give away any of her wealth without her husband’s 
    permission, even if she is wise and mature. But there was some difference of 
    scholarly opinion concerning that. Al-Layth said: That is not permissible at 
    all, either concerning one-third of her wealth or less than that, except 
    with regard to insignificant things. Tawoos and Maalik said: It is 
    permissible for a woman to give away up to one-third of her wealth without 
    her husband’s permission, but no more than that; it is not permissible to 
    give more than that without his permission. The majority are of the view 
    that it is permissible for her to give any amount away without her husband’s 
    permission, so long as she is not immature. If she is immature then it is 
    not permissible. It says in al-Fath: the latter view, which is that 
    of the majority of scholars, is well founded in the Qur’aan and Sunnah. 
Based on this, a woman 
    should not be prevented from giving some of her wealth in charity, even if 
    her husband does not approve. 

    But it is better to ask his permission so that he will feel 
    good, and so as to avoid any hard feelings on his part about his wife’s 
    spending. And he should give her permission and not stop his wife from doing 
    good deeds and treating people kindly. 

    And Allaah knows best.

48953,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/48953,Does the prohibition on isbaal include women too?,I read a hadeeth about not wearing clothes that comes down below the ankle. Does this apply to women too? Or is it for men only?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The warning with regard to isbaal (wearing clothes that come 
    below the ankle) in the case of men does not apply to women, because women 
    and commanded to cover their feet, and it is permitted to them to lengthen 
    their garments by a cubit. 

    It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: The Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever allows his 
    garment to drag out of pride, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of 
    Resurrection.” Umm Salamah said: “What should women do with their hems?” He 
    said: “Lower it a handspan.” She said: “Then their feet will show.” He said: 
    “Let them lower it a cubit, but no more than that.” 

    Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1731; al-Nasaa’i, 5336; classed as 
    saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 

    “And let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what 
    they hide of their adornment”

    [al-Noor 24:31]

    Ibn Hazm said: 
This text applies 
    to the feet and calves, which are hidden; it is not permissible to show 
    them.

    Al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad said: 

    The scholars are unanimously agreed that this is forbidden to 
    men, not to women. 

    Tarh al-Tathreeb, 8/173 

    Al-Nawawi said: 
The scholars are 
    unanimously agreed that it is permissible for women to let their garments 
    hang below their ankles (isbaal). Clear permission has been narrated from 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) for them to 
    lower their hems by a cubit.

    Sharh Muslim, 14/62. 

    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz said: 

    The point is that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) explained all that is good and called us to all that is 
    good, and he warned us against all that is evil. He  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whatever of the lower garment hangs 
    down below the ankles is in the Fire.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari in his 
    Saheeh. The izar (lower garment), trousers, thobe (dishdasha) and abaya 
    (cloak) should not come down below the ankles; whatever comes below the 
    ankles is subject to the warning mentioned in the hadeeth, with regard to 
    men. With regard to women, they have to make their clothes long enough to 
    cover their feet, because the feet are ‘awrah. It is not permissible for a 
    man to imitate women by dragging his garment or in any other way.  

    Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 
    5/28. 

    And he said: 

    There are many similar ahaadeeth, which indicate that isbaal 
    is forbidden in general terms, even if the one who does it claims that he is 
    not doing it for the sake of pride and showing off, because that is a means 
    that leads to pride, and because it is a kind of extravagance and exposing 
    clothing to dirt and impurities. But if a person does that with the 
    intention of pride then the matter is more serious and the sin is greater, 
    because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Whoever allows his garment to drag out of pride, Allaah will not look at 
    him on the Day of Resurrection.” The defining point here is the ankles. The 
    Muslim male is not allowed to let his garments come down below the ankles, 
    because of the ahaadeeth mentioned. 
But in the case of 
    females, they may make their clothes longer so as to cover the feet.

    There is nothing wrong with that, because there is no connection of blood between them, so she is a stranger (non-mahram) to him, and he is a stranger to her.

48955,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/48955,She entered ihraam for ‘umrah from Makkah. What should she do?,"I am a resident of Makkah and I wanted to do ‘umrah, but I did not go out to the meeqaat because my brother insisted that I did not have to do that. But I know that the meeqaats must be observed. What is the ruling? If I have to offer a sacrifice, and I want to send the meat outside the Kingdom, is that permissible?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    Whoever is in Makkah and wants to do ‘umrah has to go outside 
    the Haram (sanctuary) to enter ihraam for ‘umrah. It is not permissible for 
    him to enter ihraam for ‘umrah from Makkah. If he does that, then according 
    to the majority of scholars he has to offer a sacrifice, i.e., slaughter a 
    sheep in Makkah and distribute its meat to the poor of the Haram. 

    Al-Bukhaari (1556) and Muslim (1211) narrated that ‘Aa’ishah 
    (may Allaah be pleased with her), the wife of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), said: “We went out with the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) for the Farewell Pilgrimage… and 
    when we had finished Hajj the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) sent me with ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Abi Bakr to al-Tan’eem and I did 
    ‘umrah. 

    Al-Bukhaari (1215) and Muslim (1211) narrated that ‘Aa’ishah 
    (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “O Messenger of Allaah, you have done 
    ‘umrah but I did not.” He said: “O ‘Abd al-Rahmaan, take your sister to do 
    ‘umrah from al-Tan’eem,” so he seated her behind him on a camel and she did 
    ‘umrah. 

    According to a report narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim, the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Take your 
    sister out of the Haram and let her enter ihraam for ‘umrah.” 

    Al-Nawawi said: 

    “Take your sister out of the Haram and let her enter ihraam 
    for ‘umrah” is indicative of what the ‘ulama’ said, that whoever is in 
    Makkah and wants to do ‘umrah, his meeqaat is the closest point that is 
    outside the Haram, and it is not permissible to enter ihraam from inside the 
    Haram. 

    The scholars said: Rather it is obligatory to go out to the 
    area outside the Haram so that he will be outside the Haram and then enter 
    the Haram, just as the pilgrim performing Hajj does both, because he stands 
    in ‘Arafah, which is outside the Haram, then he enters Makkah to do tawaaf 
    and saa’i, etc. This is the view of al-Shaafa’i. Similarly the majority of 
    scholars said that it is obligatory to go out to the closest point that is 
    outside the Haram to enter ihraam for ‘umrah, and that if a person enters 
    ihraam for ‘umrah from the Haram and does not go out, he must offer a 
    sacrifice.  ‘Ata’ said: he does not have to do anything. Maalik said: there 
    is no option other than going outside the Haram. Al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad said: 
    Maalik said: He must enter ihraam from al-Tan’eem in particular. They said: 
    This is the meeqaat for those who are doing ‘umrah from Makkah. But this is 
    an odd view that is rejected. The view of the majority is that all areas 
    outside the Haram are the same, and al-Tan’eem need not be singled out. And 
    Allaah knows best. 

    But with regard to one who is in Makkah and wants to enter 
    ihraam for Hajj, he may enter ihraam from where he is in Makkah, and he does 
    not have to go outside the Haram. 

    The evidence for that is the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari 
    (1524) and Muslim (1181) from Ibn ‘Abbaas who said: The Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) defined the meeqaat of the people of 
    Madeenah as Dhu’l-Hulayfah; that of the people of Shaam (Syria) as 
    al-Jahfah; that of the people of Najd as Qarn al-Manaazil; and that of the 
    people of Yemen as Yalamlam. And he said: “And these meeqaats are for the 
    people at those very places, and besides them for those who come thorough 
    those places with the intention of performing Hajj and 'Umrah; and whoever 
    is living within these boundaries can enter Ihram from the place he starts, 
    and the people of Makkah can start from Makkah.” 

    Al-Haafiz said:  

    “ and the people of Makkah can start from Makkah” i.e., they 
    do not need to go out to the meeqaat to enter ihraam from there, rather they 
    may enter ihraam from Makkah. This applies only to the one who is doing 
    Hajj. As for the one who is doing ‘umrah, he has to go out to the closest 
    point that is outside the Haram. Al-Muhibb al-Tabari said: I do not know of 
    anyone who described Makkah as a meeqaat for ‘umrah. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in
    Manaasik al-Hajj wa’l-‘Umrah (p. 27), after mentioning the meeqaats: 
    Whoever is closer to Makkah than these meeqaats, his meeqaat is the place 
    where he is and he should enter ihraam from there, and the people of Makkah 
    should enter ihraam from Makkah, except in the case of ‘umrah, when those 
    who live in the Haram should enter ihraam from the closest point outside the 
    Haram. 

    Then he quoted as evidence the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah mentioned 
    above, about her doing ‘umrah with her brother ‘Abd al-Rahmaan. 

    Secondly: 

    It is obligatory to slaughter a sheep in Makkah and 
    distribute its meat to the poor of the Haram; it is not permissible to 
    distribute it outside Makkah. That is because Allaah says concerning the 
    penalty for hunting in the Haram (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “O you who believe! Kill not the game while you are in a 
    state of Ihraam [for Hajj or ‘Umrah (pilgrimage)], and whosoever of you 
    kills it intentionally, the penalty is an offering, brought to the Ka‘bah, 
    of an eatable animal (i.e. sheep, goat, cow) equivalent to the one he 
    killed, as adjudged by two just men among you”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:95] 

    “and afterwards they are brought for sacrifice unto the 
    ancient House (the Haram — sacred territory of Makkah)”

    [al-Hajj 22:33]
The Standing Committee 
    was asked about some people who entered ihraam for ‘umrah from Kada (a place 
    in Makkah) and did not go out to al-Tan’eem. 

    They replied: 
These people who entered 
    ihraam for ‘umrah from Kada made a mistake, because Kada is not outside the 
    Haram, rather it is part of the Haram and is not like al-Tan’eem or 
    al-Ji’raanah, because both al-Tan’eem and al-Ji’raanah are outside the 
    Haram. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did 
    ‘umrah from al-Ji’raanah and he did not do ‘umrah from al-Tan’eem, rather he 
    told ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Abi Bakr to go with his sister ‘Aa’ishah to enter 
    ihraam for ‘umrah from al-Tan’eem, because it was the closest place outside 
    the Haram. If it were permissible to enter ihraam for ‘umrah from inside the 
    boundaries of the Haram, he would have given ‘Aa’ishah permission to enter 
    ihraam from where she was in al-Abtah, and he would not have told her and 
    her brother to go to al-Tan’eem to enter ihraam for ‘umrah from there, 
    because that would cause unnecessary hardship when they were traveling. When 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was given the 
    choice between two things, he would always chose the one that was easier so 
    long as it was not a sin. Comparing Kada to al-Tan’eem and al-Ji’raanah is 
    not correct, because entering ihraam from the meeqaats is part of the 
    rituals. But their ‘umrahs are still valid. So each of them has to offer a 
    sacrifice for entering ihraam for ‘umrah from inside the Haram. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in Fataawa Arkaan al-Islam 
    (p. 515): 

    Whoever wants to do Hajj or ‘umrah has to enter ihraam from 
    the meeqaat when he passes it, and he should not go any further without 
    doing so. If he does that and passes the meeqaat, then he has to go back and 
    enter ihraam from there. If he goes back and enters ihraam then there is no 
    penalty, but if he enters ihraam from where he is and does not go back, then 
    according to the scholars he has to offer a sacrifice and distribute its 
    meat to the poor of Makkah.",Islam Q&A

    It is not permissible for a woman to observe i’tikaaf without 
    her husband’s permission, because her observing i’tikaaf in the mosque 
    affects the husband’s rights. 

    If he does give her permission, he has the right to cancel it 
    and call her out of i’tikaaf. 

    Ibn Qudaamah (4/485) said: 

    The wife does not have the right to observe i’tikaaf without 
    her husband’s permission… if her husband gives her permission, then he wants 
    her to come out after she has started i’tikaaf, he has the right to call her 
    out in the case of a voluntary i’tikaaf. This is the view of al-Shaafa’i… If 
    what he gave permission for was something that she vowed to do, then he does 
    not have the right to bring her out, because it becomes obligatory once it 
    is started and must be completed, like Hajj once one has entered ihraam for 
    it. 

    The Sunnah indicates that it is permissible for a man to 
    prevent his wife from observing i’tikaaf without his permission. 

    Al-Bukhaari (2033) and Muslim (1173) narrated that ‘Aa’ishah 
    (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: When the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted to observe i’tikaaf, he 
    would pray Fajr then enter his place of i’tikaaf. He ordered that his tent 
    be pitched, intending to observe i’tikaaf for the last ten days of Ramadaan. 
    Then Zaynab ordered that her tent be pitched, and others among the wives of 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also ordered 
    that their tents be pitched. When the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed Fajr, he saw the tents and said: “Do 
    you intend righteousness by doing this?” Then he commanded that his tent be 
    taken down, and he abandoned i’tikaaf in Ramadaan and observed i’tikaaf for 
    ten days at the beginning of Shawwaal. 

    According to a report narrated by al-Bukhaari:  ‘Aa’ishah 
    asked him for permission (to observe i’tikaaf) and he gave her permission, 
    then Hafsah asked ‘Aa’ishah to ask for permission for her and she did so.  

    Al-Nawawi said: 

    “Righteousness” here means obedience or worship. Al-Qaadi 
    said: He  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said this by way 
    of rebuke. He  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had given 
    some of them permission to do that, as narrated by al-Bukhaari. The reason 
    why he criticized that was that he feared that they would not be sincere in 
    their i’tikaaf, and all they wanted was to be close to him because of their 
    jealousy concerning him, or because of his protective jealousy towards them, 
    so he did not want them to stay in the mosque when it was the place where 
    people gathered and was attended by the Bedouins and hypocrites, and they 
    would need to go out and come in to attend to their needs and thus they 
    would be exposed to people’s gaze… Or it may have been because he  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw them with him when he was in 
    the mosque and it was as if he was at home with his wives, which was a 
    distraction from the purpose of i’tikaaf, which is to keep away from one's 
    wives and worldly concerns, etc. Or it may have been because they were 
    crowding the mosque with their tents. This hadeeth indicates that women’s 
    i’tikaaf is valid, because he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) gave them permission, and he only stopped them from doing it afterwards 
    for a reason. And it indicates that a man may prevent his wife from 
    observing i’tikaaf without his permission. This is the view of all the 
    scholars. If he has given her permission, can he prevent her after that? 
    There is a difference of opinion among the scholars on this point. According 
    to al-Shaafa’i, Ahmad and Dawood he has the right to stop her and bring her 
    out of a voluntary i’tikaaf. 

    Ibn al-Mundhir and others said: This hadeeth indicates that a 
    woman should not enter i’tikaaf until she has asked her husband’s 
    permission, and that if she enters i’tikaaf without his permission he has 
    the right to bring her out; if he has given permission he has the right to 
    change his mind and stop her. It was narrated from ahl al-ra’y that if the 
    husband gives her permission then stops her, he commits sin thereby and she 
    may refuse. It was narrated from Maalik that he does not have the right to 
    do that. But this hadeeth is proof against them.

Reward for tarawih 


Offering qiyam in the last ten days of Ramadan


Reward for offering qiyam in Laylat al-Qadr


Offering Tarawih in congregation","Praise be to Allah.Is Tarawih sunnah? 
Tarawih prayer is Sunnah mustahabbah (i.e., recommended) according to scholarly consensus, and comes under the heading of qiyam al-layl (night prayers). It is supported by the evidence of the Quran and Sunnah which encourages qiyam al-layl and describes its virtues. 
Reward for tarawih 
Praying qiyam in Ramadan is one of the greatest acts of worship by means of which a person can draw closer to his Lord in this month. Al-Hafiz Ibn Rajab said: “Note that in the month of Ramadan the believer engages in jihad al-nafs on two fronts: during the day by fasting and during the night by praying qiyam. Whoever combines these two types of jihad will be given reward without limit.”  
There are some hadiths which speak specifically about praying qiyam in Ramadan and describe the virtue of doing so. For example: 
Al-Bukhari (37) and Muslim (759) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays qiyam in Ramadan out of faith and in the hope of reward, his previous sins will be forgiven.” 
“Whoever prays qiyam in Ramadan” means spends its nights in prayer. 
“Out of faith” means, believing in Allah’s promise of reward. 
“And in the hope of reward” means, seeking the reward and with no other intention such as showing off etc. 
“Will be forgiven his previous sins”: 
Ibn al-Mundhir was certain that this includes both minor and major sins, but al-Nawawi said: What is known among the jurists is that this applies only to forgiveness of minor sins, not major sins. Some of them said: It may mean that the burden of major sins is reduced, so long as there are no minor sins.” (Fath al-Bari) 
Offering qiyam in the last ten days of Ramadan
The believer should be keen to strive in worship in the last ten nights of Ramadan more than at other times, because in these ten nights is Laylat al-Qadr , of which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The Night of Al-Qadr (Decree) is better than a thousand months” [al-Qadr 97:3]
Reward for offering qiyam in Laylat al-Qadr
Concerning the reward of qiyam on this night, it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever spends Laylat al-Qadr in prayer out of faith and in the hope of reward, his previous sins will be forgiven.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1768; Muslim, 1268) 
Hence the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to strive hard in worship in the last ten nights as he did not do at other times. (Narrated by Muslim, 1175) 
Al-Bukhari (2024) and Muslim (1174) narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “When the last ten days began, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would tie his lower garment (izar) tight and stay up at night, and wake his family.” 
“The last ten days” means the last ten days of Ramadan. 
“Tie his lower garment (izar) tight” - it was said that this is a metaphor for striving hard in worship, or for keeping away from his wives, and it may be that it includes both meanings. 
“stay up at night” means staying up and praying and doing other acts of worship. 
“And wake his family” means, he would wake them up to pray at night. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
“This hadIth indicates that it is mustahabb to do more acts of worship during the last ten nights of Ramadan, and to stay up at night to worship.” 
Offering Tarawih in congregation
We should be keen to pray qiyam al-layl in Ramadan in congregation , and to stay with the imam until he finishes praying. In this way, the worshipper will attain the reward for praying the whole night, even if he only spends a short part of the night in prayer. And Allah is the Owner of great bounty. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
The scholars agreed that it is mustahabb to pray Tarawih , but they differed as to whether it is better for a person to pray on his own at home or in congregation in the mosque. Al-Shafi`i and most of his companions, Abu Hanifah, Ahmad and some of the Malikis and others said that it is better to pray it in congregation, as `Umar ibn al-Khattab and the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) did and as the Muslims continued to do. 
Al-Tirmidhi (806) narrated that Abu Dharr said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays qiyam with the imam until he finishes, will be recorded as having spent the whole night in prayer.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi)

48958,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/48958,It is not prescribed to put palm-leaf stalks or flowers on graves,I read a hadeeth which says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) put a palm-leaf stalk on a grave. Is it Sunnah for the one who visits a grave to do that?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The hadeeth referred to by the questioner was narrated by al-Bukhari (218) and Muslim (292) from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed by two graves and said: “They are being punished, but they are not being punished for something that was difficult to avoid. One of them used not to take precautions to avoid (his body or clothes being soiled by) urine, and the other used to walk around spreading malicious gossip.” Then he took a fresh palm-leaf stalk and split it in two, and placed one piece on each of the two graves. They said: O Messenger of Allah, why did you do that?” He said: “Perhaps the torment will be reduced for them so long as this does not dry out.” 
Some of the scholars said that the reason why the torment would be reduced for them was that the fresh palm-leaf stalk glorifies Allah, so that would be the reason why the torment would be reduced. This is subject to further discussion. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
This is the view of many or most of the mufassireen concerning the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and there is not a thing but glorifies His Praise”[al-Isra’ 17:44]
They said: What this means is everything that has life in it. Then they said: The life of everything is in accordance with its nature, and wood is alive so long as it has not dried out and a rock is alive so long as it has not been cut. Some mufassireen and others were of the view that this is to be understood in general terms. 
i.e., that the tasbeeh (glorification of Allah) does not apply only to the fresh leaf in exclusion of the dry; rather everything, fresh or dry, glorifies and praises Allah. 
Al-Khattaabi and those who followed him criticized the action of placing palm-leaf stalks and the like on graves, following this hadeeth. He said concerning this hadeeth: it is to be understood as meaning that he prayed that their torment might be reduced so long as these stalks remained fresh, not that the stalk had any significance in and of itself, nor that there is any significance in the fresh stalk that is not in the dry. 
Based on this, this action was something that was only for the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and it is not recommended for anyone to place palm-leaf stalks or anything else on graves. 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah: 
When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) put the palm-leaf stalk on the two graves and hoped that the torment of the two people on whose graves he placed it would be reduced, that was a specific incident related to those two people only, is not to be taken as generally applicable; it applies only to the two whose torment Allah caused him to know of. That is something that was only for the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and it is not a universal Sunnah to be done to the graves of the Muslims. Rather it only occurred two or three times, if we count the number of times that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did it. It is not known that any of the Sahaabah did that, and they were the keenest of all Muslims to follow the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and to benefit the Muslims. There is only one report from Buraydah al-Sulami, who left instructions that two palm-leaf stalks should be placed on his grave. But we do not know of any of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) who agreed with Buraydah in that. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz said: 
That is not prescribed in Islam, rather it is bid’ah (an innovation), because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) only placed the palm-leaf stalk on the two graves of the people whose torment he was made aware of; he did not place them on any other graves. From that we know that it is not permissible to put them on graves, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever introduces anything into this matter of ours (Islam) that is not part of it, will have it rejected.” According to a version narrated by Muslim: “Whoever does anything that is not part of this matter of ours (Islam), will have it rejected.” 
Similarly, it is not permissible to write on graves or to place flowers on them, because of the two hadeeth quoted above, and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade plastering over graves, erecting structures over them, sitting on them and writing on them.

    The Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) – regarding both his commands to others and 
    his own actions – is to let the beard grow. It was proven that the Messenger 
    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded men to 
    leave the beard alone and let it grow naturally. Al-Bukhaari, Muslim and 
    others narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) 
    said: the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “Trim the moustache and leave the beard.” Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 5443; Muslim, 600. According to another report: ‘Be different 
    from the mushrikeen: cut the moustache and let the beard grow.” Narrated by 
    Muslim, 602. 

    And Muslim (383) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Trim the moustache and let the beard grow; be 
    different from the Magians (Zoroastrians).” 

    It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (5/136): 

    What is meant by letting the beard grow is leaving it alone 
    and not cutting it, so that it will grow thick. This is the teaching of the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) as regards his 
    words and commands to others. With regard to his own actions, there is no 
    report that says that he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    removed anything from his beard. With regard to the hadeeth narrated by 
    al-Tirmidhi from ‘Amr ibn Shu’ayb, from his father, from his grandfather, 
    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to 
    remove something from the width and length of his beard – al-Tirmidhi said 
    that this is a ghareeb hadeeth (al-Tirmidhi, 2912). This isnaad of this 
    hadeeth includes ‘Umar ibn Haroon who is matrook (rejected), as al-Haafiz 
    Ibn Hajar said in al-Taqreeb. Hence it is known that this hadeeth is 
    not saheeh and cannot be used as evidence to oppose the saheeh hadeeths 
    which indicate that it is obligatory to leave the beard alone and let it 
    grow. 

    With regard to what some people do, shaving the beard or 
    trimming something from its thickness and length, this is not permissible 
    because it goes against the teachings of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his command to let the beard grow. A 
    command implies that a thing is obligatory unless there is an indication to 
    suggest otherwise, and we know of no such indication in this case. 
Shaykh Muhammad 
    al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Cutting anything from the 
    beard goes against the command of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) who said: “Leave the beard alone”, “Let the beard grow,” 
    etc. Whoever wants to follow the command of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and follow his teaching should not remove 
    anything from his beard at all, because the teaching of the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is that nothing should be 
    removed from the beard. This was also the way of the Prophets before him. 

    Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 11/126. 

    Some of the scholars are of the view that it is permissible 
    to remove anything more than a “handful” of the beard [the hair of the beard 
    that comes beneath the hand if the beard is seized in the hand], basing that 
    on the action of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him). Al-Bukhaari 
    (5892) narrated: When Ibn ‘Umar did Hajj or ‘Umrah he would take hold of his 
    beard and would trim any excess. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz said: 
    Whoever quotes the action of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) to 
    show that he used to cut whatever of his beard was longer than the “handful” 
    during Hajj cannot use this as evidence, because this is ijtihaad on the 
    part of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him), and proof is to be found 
    in reports (from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him)), not from ijtihaad. The scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) 
    clearly stated that the reports from the Sahaabah and those who came after 
    them that are proven to be sound are what constitute evidence and proof, and 
    they take precedence over any opinion if it goes against the Sunnah.  

    Fataawa wa Maqaalaat al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 
    8/370. 

    Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Qaasim said in his essay 
    Tahreem Halq al-Lahyah (Prohibition on shaving the beard), p.11: 

    Some scholars granted a concession allowing removal of 
    whatever is longer than the “handful”, based on the actions of Ibn ‘Umar, 
    but most of the scholars regard that as makrooh. This is more correct, for 
    the reasons stated above. Al-Nawawi said: The preferred view is that the 
    beard should be left as it is and should not be shortened in any way at all… 
    and it says in al-Durr al-Mukhtaar: with regard to cutting it any 
    shorter than the “handful”, no one said that this is permissible.

This is what I understand from the hadeeth. Please explain further.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly:  

    This hadeeth was 
    narrated by Ibn Majah (2620) and al-‘Aqeeli in al-Du’afa (457) and 
    al-Bayhaqi in al-Sunan (8/22). It is a da’eef (weak) hadeeth which is not 
    soundly narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon 
    him). Imam Ahmad said: This hadeeth is not saheeh. 

    Indeed, Abu Hatim 
    ruled it to be mawdoo’ (fabricated), and al-Thahabi agreed with him. Ibn 
    al-Jawzi narrated it in al-Mawdoo’at (2/104). Ibn Hibban said: This is a 
    mawdoo’ (fabricated) hadeeth which has no basis. 

    Ibn Hajar and 
    al-Munthiri said: (This is) a very weak hadeeth. Al-Zayla’i said: it is a 
    weak (da’eef) hadeeth. 

    Al-Albani 
    mentioned it in Da’eef Sunan Ibn Majah and said: (it is) very weak. 

    Secondly: 

    Even though this 
    hadeeth is weak, there is no doubt that helping to kill a Muslim unlawfully 
    is a major sin. 

    Al-‘Izz ibn ‘Abd 
    al-Salam (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book al-Qawa’id: 

    If you want to 
    know the difference between a minor sin and a major sin, then compare the 
    consequences of the sin with the consequences of a major sin as stated in 
    the texts. If it is less than the least consequences of a major sin, then it 
    is a minor sin. If it is equal to or greater than the least consequences of 
    a major sin, then it is also a major sin. Whoever insults the Lord, may He 
    be glorified, or His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), 
    or mocks the Messengers, or disbelieves in one of them, or throws filth at 
    the Ka’bah, or throws the Mus-haf (copy of the Quran)  into the garbage – 
    these are major sins, even though the sharee’ah does not state clearly that 
    they are major sins. Similarly, if a person holds down a chaste woman for 
    another to commit zina (adultery) with her, or holds down a Muslim for him 
    to kill him, the evil consequences of these acts are undoubtedly greater 
    than the consequences of consuming the wealth of an orphan, even though that 
    is also a major sin. Similarly if a person guides the kuffar (non-Muslims) 
    to the weak points of the Muslims, even though he knows that they will 
    destroy the Muslims as a result of his help and will take their women and 
    children captive, and plunder their wealth, then this is more serious than 
    his running away from the battle field with no excuse, even though that is a 
    major sin. Similarly if he tells a lie about a person for which he knows 
    that person will be killed, then it is a major sin, but telling a lie which 
    will result in a date being taken away from him, is not a major sin.”  

    Helping a kafir to 
    kill a Muslim may constitute kufr (disbelief) in some cases. The scholars 
    mentioned things that nullify a person’s Islam, one of which is supporting 
    the mushrikeen (polytheists) and helping them against the Muslims. See 
    question no. 
    
    33691. 

    Thirdly: 

    It is not 
    permissible for anyone to take the matter of attributing hadeeth to the 
    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) lightly. He (peace and 
    blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever tells lies about me, it is 
    not like telling lies about anyone else. Whoever tells lies about me 
    deliberately, let him take his place in Hell.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1291; 
    Muslim, 4. 

    And he (peace and 
    blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever narrates a hadeeth from me 
    which is known to be false, he is one of the liars.” Narrated by Muslim in 
    the introduction to his Saheeh. 

    And al-Nawawi 
    said: 

    [This hadeeth has 
    been narrated in two versions, one of which says al-kathibayn (the two liars 
    – dual form) and the more well-known version which says al-kathibeen (the 
    liars – plural).] Al-Qadi ‘Iyad said: The version which we have says 
    al-kathibeen (plural) and Abu Na’eem al-Asbahani narrated it in his book 
    al-Mustakhraj ‘ala Saheeh Muslim from the hadeeth of Samurah, where it says 
    al-kathibayn, in the dual form. Some of the imams said that the word yura 
    [translated above as “known to be” as yara [meaning “knowing (himself).” Or 
    it could mean “thinking [that it is false].” In this case the hadeeth means 
    that the person becomes a sinner only when he himself knows or thinks that 
    what he is narrating from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon 
    him) is a lie. But if he did not know or think that it was a lie, then there 
    is no sin on him if he narrated it, even if others think that it is false, 
    or know that to be the case.  But what we may conclude from this hadeeth is 
    that lying is strongly condemned, and that whoever thinks that what he is 
    narrating is most likely false, but still narrates it, is a liar. How can he 
    not be a liar when he is narrating something that did not happen? 

    If a person does 
    not have sufficient knowledge to be able to distinguish between a saheeh 
    (authentic) hadeeth and a da’eef (weak) one, then he should ask the scholars 
    who are specialized in this field, and refer to the comments of the imams 
    and scholars that are compiled in books, in accordance with the words of 
    Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “So ask of those who know the Scripture, if you know not.” [16:43].",Islam Q&A
48964,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/48964,"What are the guidelines concerning names which may correctly be attributed to Allaah, may He be exalted?",Is it correct to call Allaah al-Mutakallim (the One Who speaks) or al-Baatish (the One Who seizes) because it is narrated that He does those actions?.,,,"Praise be to Allah., and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allaah and his family and companions. 
All the names of Allaah are tawqeefi, i.e., we should accept what is narrated in the Qur’aan and Sunnah and not add or subtract anything. Based on this, it is not correct to call Allaah by any name other than those by which He has called Himself in His Book or those that His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) called Him by in the saheeh ahaadeeth, because the human mind cannot work out the names that Allaah deserves, so we must stop at what is mentioned in the texts, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And follow not (O man, i.e., say not, or do not, or witness not) that of which you have no knowledge. Verily, the hearing, and the sight, and the heart of each of those ones will be questioned (by Allaah)”
[al-Isra’ 17:36]
Calling Allaah by a name that He has not called Himself, or denying a name by which he has called Himself is a transgression against the rights of Allaah. So we should observe the proper etiquette and adhere to that which is narrated in the texts. 
With regard to words which are mentioned in the Qur’aan and Sunnah only by way of description or information, and it is not narrated that Allaah is called by these names, it is not correct to call Him by them, because some of the attributes of Allaah have to do with His actions, and the actions of Allaah have no end, just as His words have no end. 
For example, some of the attributes of Allaah that refer to His actions describe Him as coming, bringing, taking, withholding and seizing etc., as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And your Lord comes with the angels in rows”
[al-Fajr 89:22] 
“He withholds the heaven from falling on the earth except by His Leave”
[al-Hajj 22:65] 
“Verily, (O Muhammad) the Seizure (punishment) of your Lord is severe and painful”
[al-Burooj 85:12]
So we attribute these characteristics to Allaah as they are mentioned, but we do not call Him by them (i.e., we do not make names out of them), so we do not say that among His names are al-Jaa’i (the Comer), al-Aati (the Comer), al-Mumsik (the Withholder) or al-Baatish (the Seizer), etc. Rather we say that this is what He does and attribute those actions to Him.  
And Allaah knows best.

Singling out one night of Ramadan as Laylat al-Qadr 
With regard to singling out one night of Ramadan and regarding that as Laylat al-Qadr , this requires evidence. But the odd-numbered nights during the last ten nights are more likely than others, and the night of the twenty-seventh is more likely to be Laylat al-Qadr , because of the hadiths which indicate that.

However, it is permissible to greet a non-Muslim first if that serves a purpose, or for fear of his harm, or because of blood ties, or for a reason that requires that.",,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on greeting non-Muslims . 
He replied as follows: 
“Greeting a non-Muslim first is prohibited because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not initiate the greeting with the Jews and Christians, and if you meet them in the street push them towards the narrowest part of it.” But if they greet us, we have to respond to them , because of the general meaning of the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“When you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it, or (at least) return it equally.” [An-Nisa’ 4:86]
The Jews used to greet the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) by saying, “As-sam `Alaykum ya Muhammad (Death be upon you, O Muhammad),” praying that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would die. So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Jews say `As-sam `alaykum (death be upon you),’ so if they greet you, then say, `Wa `Alaykum (and also upon you).’” 
If a non-Muslim greets a Muslim by saying “As-samu `alaykum,” then we should respond by saying “wa `alaykum (and also upon you).” 
The fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said “wa `alaykum” indicates that if they were saying “As-salamu `alaykum (peace be upon you),” then peace will also be upon them, i.e., whatever they say to us, we say to them. Hence some of the scholars said that if a Jew, Christian or other non-Muslim clearly says “As-salamu `alaykum,” it is permissible for us to say “ `alaykum As-salam (upon you be peace).”  
Similarly it is not permissible to initiate a greeting such as “Ahlan wa sahlan” (welcome) and the like, because that is a kind of honouring them. But if they say something like that to us, then we should say something similar to them, because the greeting should be returned in like manner and each person should be given his due. It is well known that the Muslims are higher in status before Allah, so they should not humiliate themselves in front of non-Muslims by greeting them first. 
So, in conclusion, it is not permissible for us to greet non-Muslims first, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade that, and because this is a humiliation for the Muslim when he starts to honour a non-Muslim. The Muslim is higher in status before Allah, so he should not humiliate himself in this manner. But if we are greeted then we should return the greeting in similar terms. 
Similarly it is not permissible for us to greet them first with words such as “Ahlan wa sahlan” (welcome), “Marhaban” (hello) and so on, because that is a kind of honouring them, so it is like initiating the greeting of Salams with them.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 3/33) 
However, if there is a need to greet a non-Muslim first, then there is no sin in that, but it should be something other than the greeting of Salam, such as saying “Ahlan wa sahlan” or “how are you”, etc. In that case the greeting is for a reason, not to honour him. (See Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, 25/168) 
Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Zad Al-Ma`ad (2/424), concerning greeting a non-Muslim first: 
“A group of scholars said: It is permissible to greet him first if that serves a purpose, or for fear of his harm, or because of blood ties, or for a reason that requires that.”

48967,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/48967,Undoing Witchcraft Using Witchcraft,Is it permissible to undo witchcraft by using witchcraft?,,,"Praise be to Allah.and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allah and his family and companions. 
Undoing the effects of witchcraft on one who has been bewitched means that one of the following two scenarios must apply: 
1 – That the ruqyahs (incantations) prescribed in sharee’ah (Islamic law) and the prayers for refuge with Allah that are narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and permissible medicines are used. There is nothing wrong with this, but one must be careful to adhere to the guidelines prescribed in Islam with regard to ruqyah. See question no.  12918. 
2 – That the witchcraft is treated by means of witchcraft, which means getting close to the jinn by means of offering sacrifices and other acts of worship. This is not permissible, because this is a devilish action, and indeed it is major shirk (polytheism) and we must avoid it. Similarly it is not permissible to treat the problem by asking fortune-tellers, soothsayers and magicians for help and doing what they say, because they are not believers and they are liars and evildoers who claim to have knowledge of the unseen and who deceive people. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned us against going to them and believing what they say. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever goes to a fortune-teller and asks him about something, his prayer will not be accepted for forty days.” And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever goes to a soothsayer and believes what he says has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” The practitioners of witchcraft are kafirs (disbelievers) and it is not permissible to go to them or to ask them about anything or to believe them. 
It was narrated in a saheeh (authentic) report that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about nashrah. He said: “It is the work of the shaytan.” [in his Musnad, Abu Dawood] Nashrah means undoing witchcraft by means of witchcraft. What the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) meant by nashrah is that which the people of the Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic days of ignorance) used to do, when they would ask the practitioners of witchcraft to undo spells, or undoing witchcraft by means of a spell from another practitioner of witchcraft. 
With regard to undoing witchcraft by means of ruqyah and prayers for refuge with Allah as prescribed in sharee’ah, and permissible kinds of medicine, there is nothing wrong with such methods. This was stated by Ibn al-Qayyim and Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Hasan in Fath al-Majeed, and also by other scholars. Allah is the One Whom we ask to keep the Muslims safe from all evils and to preserve their religious commitment and help them to understand their religion, and to keep them safe from everything that goes against His laws. May Allah send peace and blessings upon His slave and Messenger Muhammad and upon his family and companions.

48969,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/48969,When should the takbeer for Eid al-Fitr begin?,When should the takbeer for Eid al-Fitr begin and when does it end?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.At the end of Ramadan Allah has prescribed that His slaves should recite takbeer. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“(He wants that you) must complete the same number (of days), and that you must magnify Allah [i.e. to say Takbeer (Allahu Akbar: Allah is the Most Great)] for having guided you so that you may be grateful to Him” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
“that you must magnify Allah” means venerating Him in your hearts and on your lips, by pronouncing the takbeer. 
So you should say: Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, laa ilaaha ill-Allah, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, wa Lillaahi’l-hamd (Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, there is no god except Allah, Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, and all praise be to Allah). 
Or you can say Allahu akbar three times, so you say: 
Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, laa ilaaha ill-Allah, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, wa Lillaahi’l-hamd (Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, there is no god except Allah, Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great , Allah is Most Great, and all praise be to Allah). 
Both are permissible. 
This takbeer is Sunnah according to the majority of scholars. It is Sunnah for both men and woman, in the mosque, in the home and in the marketplace. Men should say it out loud, and women should say it quietly, because women are commanded to lower their voices. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If you notice something during the prayer, men should say ‘Subhan-Allah!’ and women should clap.” So women should say the takbeer quietly and men should say it out loud. 
The time for this takbeer begins when the sun sets on the night of Eid (i.e., the night before) if it is known that the new month has begun when the sun sets, such as when the people have completed thirty days of Ramadaan, or when it is proven that the new moon of Shawwal has been sighted. And it ends when the prayer begins, i.e., when they start the Eid prayer then the time for the takbeer ends. 
Majmoo’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 16/269-272. 
Al-Shaafa’i said in al-Umm: 
Allah says concerning the month of Ramadaan (interpretation of the meaning):
“(He wants that you) must complete the same number (of days), and that you must magnify Allah [i.e. to say Takbeer (Allahu Akbar: Allah is the Most Great)] for having guided you” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
I heard from some scholars whom I trust and who are knowledgeable about the Qur’aan: 
“(He wants that you) must complete the same number (of days), and that you must magnify Allah [i.e. to say Takbeer (Allahu Akbar: Allah is the Most Great)] for having guided you” it is completed when the sun sets on the last day of the month of Ramadan. 
Then al-Shaafa’i said: 
When they see the new moon of Shawwal, I like all the people to recite takbeer together and individually in the mosques, the marketplaces, the streets, the houses, travellers and non-travellers in all situations, no matter where they are. They should pronounce the takbeer openly and continue to recite it until they come to the prayer-place the next morning, and after that until the imam comes out to lead the prayer, then they should stop reciting the takbeer. 
Then he narrated from Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib, ‘Urwah ibn al-Zubayr, Abu Salamah and Abu Bakr ibn ‘Abd al-Rahmaan, that they used to recite takbeer on the night before Eid al-Fitr in the mosque, reciting the takbeer out loud. 
It was narrated from ‘Urwah ibn al-Zubayr and Abu Salamah ibn ‘Abd al-Rahmaan that they used to recite the takbeer out loud when they came to the prayer-pace in the morning, and that Naafi’ ibn Jubayr used to recite the takbeer out loud when he came to the prayer-place in the morning of the day of Eid. 
It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that he used to come to the prayer-place on the morning of the day of Eid al-Fitr, when the sun had risen, and he would recite takbeer until he reached the prayer-place, then he would recite takbeer in the prayer-place until the imam sat down and stopped reciting takbeer.",Islam Q&A

    involves harming the Muslims, and whoever harms the Muslims, Allaah will 
    punish him. The one who does this is a sinner, and his earnings are haraam. 
    The one who does that deserves be punished because of the deceitful and

    that fruits and vegetables have been produced in this manner to market them,

    Farmers and other Muslims should fear Allaah and cooperate in righteousness and piety, and they should keep away from the means of sin and transgression; they should seek a halaal income and good provision, and avoid haraam earnings, and they should not deceived by the attractions of this world and accumulating wealth by any means, whether halaal or haraam. A little of halaal wealth is better than a great deal of haraam wealth. The Muslims should inform the authorities of those who are doing this so that they can put a stop to it, because this is a kind of evil action which must be denounced and stopped.

He started with the prayer before the khutbah, with no adhaan or iqaamah. 
Al-Bukhaari (960) and Muslim (886) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas and Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah al-Ansaari said: No adhaan was given on the day of al-Fitr or the day of al-Adha (i.e., for the Eid prayer). Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah al-Ansaari said: There is no adhaan for the prayer on the day of al-Fitr when the imam comes out, or after he comes out; no iqaamah, no call, nothing. There is no call on that day and no iqaamah. 
This hadeeth indicates that there is no adhaan or iqaamah for the Eid prayer and that no call is given for it. 
Some of the scholars are of the view that a call should be given for it by saying “al-salaatu jaami’ah (prayer is about to begin)” by analogy with the eclipse prayer. 
This is an analogy which contradicts the hadeeth of Jaabir quoted above, so no attention should be paid to it. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Some of our companions said that a call should be given for it, i.e., “al-salaatu jaami’ah (prayer is about to begin)”. This is the view of al-Shaafa’i. But the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is more deserving of being followed. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
There is no call for the Eid prayer or prayers for rain (al-istisqa’). This is the view of a number of our companions. This was quoted from him in al-Insaaf, 1/428. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said in Zaad al-Ma’aad: 
When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) reached the prayer-place he would commence the prayer – i.e., the Eid prayer – with no adhaan or iqaamah, and he did not say “al-salaatu jaami’ah (prayer is about to begin)”. The Sunnah is not to do any of those things. 
Al-San’aani said in Subul al-Salaam, concerning the view that it is nustahabb to call people to the Eid prayer by saying “al-salaatu jaami’ah (prayer is about to begin)”: 
This view is not correct, because there is no evidence that it is mustahabb. If it were mustahabb the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would not have failed to do it, and neither would the Rightly-Guided Caliphs who came after him. That is proven with regard to the eclipse prayer, not for any other, and it is not correct to draw an analogy between them, because if there was a reason for doing something during his lifetime but he did not do it, doing it after he is gone is a bid’ah (innovation), so it cannot be proven by analogy or otherwise. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked: Is there any adhaan or iqaamah for the Eid prayer? 
He replied: 
There is no adhaan or iqaamah for the Eid prayer, as was proven in the Sunnah, but some scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) said that a call may be given for it by saying “al-salaatu jaami’ah (prayer is about to begin)”. But there is no evidence for this view, so it is weak (da’eef). It is not correct to draw an analogy with the eclipse prayer, because an eclipse may come without people realizing it, unlike the Eid prayer. So the Sunnah is not to give any adhaan or iqaamah to call people by saying “al-salaatu jaami’ah (prayer is about to begin)”. Rather the people should come out, and when the imam arrives they should pray without any adhaan or iqaamah, then after that comes the khutbah.

48973,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/48973,Types of ‘uboodiyyah,"I read some verses which seem to indicate that the slaves of the Most Merciful are only the believers, such as the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And the (faithful) slaves of the Most Gracious (Allaah) are those who walk on the earth in humility and sedateness”
[al-Furqaan 25:63] 
But some other verses indicate that all people are the slaves of Allaah, such as the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Gracious (Allaah) as a slave”
[Maryam 19:93] 
How can we reconcile between these verses?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allaah and his family and companions. 
You should note – may Allaah guide you to obey Him – that ‘uboodiyyah (servitude to Allaah) is of two types: a specific type and a general type. 
‘Uboodiyyah in the specific sense means the servitude of love, submission and obedience by which a person is honoured. This is what is referred to in verses such as the following (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allaah is very Gracious and Kind to His slaves”
[al-Shoora 42:19]
“And the (faithful) slaves of the Most Gracious (Allaah) are those who walk on the earth in humility and sedateness”
[al-Furqaan 25:63]
This kind of ‘uboodiyyah or servitude applies only to the believers who obey Allaah, and is not shared with the kuffaar who rebel against the laws, commands and prohibitions of Allaah. People vary greatly with regard to this servitude; the more a person loves Allaah, follows His commands and submits to His laws, the greater his servitude. The ones who achieved the highest level in this regard were the Prophets and Messengers, and the greatest of all was our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Hence no one is described as being a true slave of Allaah in the most complete sense in the Qur’aan except him (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Allaah describes him as His slave in the context of Revelation, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“All the praises and thanks be to Allaah, Who has sent down to His slave (Muhammad) the Book (the Qur’aan), and has not placed therein any crookedness”
[al-Kahf 18:1]
And in the context of the Isra’ [Night Journey] (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Glorified (and Exalted) be He (Allaah) [above all that (evil) they associate with Him]
Who took His slave (Muhammad) for a journey by night from Al-Masjid Al-Haraam (at Makkah) to Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem)”
[al-Isra’ 17:1]
and in the context of supplication (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And when the slave of Allaah (Muhammad) stood up invoking Him (his Lord Allaah) in prayer they (the jinn) just made round him a dense crowd as if sticking one over the other (in order to listen to the Prophet’s recitation)”
[al-Jinn 72:19]
and there are other similar verses. 
All honour is to be found in achieving this servitude in the fullest sense, which can only be achieved by acknowledging one’s complete dependence on Allaah and feeling completely independent of other people. This can only be achieved when a person combines love for Allaah with fear of Him and hope for His bounty and reward. 
With regard to servitude in the general sense, no created being is excluded from this. It is called compulsory servitude. In this sense all people are slaves of Allaah and are subject to His rulings, and His decree is carried out on them. No one has the power to do harm or do good for himself except by the Leave of his Lord and Sovereign Who controls him. This is the kind of servitude that is referred to in verses such as the following (interpretation of the meaning): 
“There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Gracious (Allaah) as a slave”
[Maryam 19:93]
This kind of servitude does not imply any kind of honour. Whoever turns away from the specific type of servitude mentioned above is still subjugated to servitude in the general sense, and cannot be excluded from that in any circumstances. All creatures are the slaves of Allaah by His will, so whoever does not want to be a slave of Allaah by choice is still a slave of Allaah by compulsion. 
We ask Allaah to make us among His sincere slaves and close friends, for He is All-Hearing, Ever-Close and Ever Responsive. And Allaah knows best. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon His slave Muhammad and upon all his family and companions.

When can a traveler break his fast?","Praise be to Allah.Can you break your fast while traveling?
Yes, it is permissible for a fasting person to break his fast if he travels during the day . This is the view of Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him). (See al-Mughni, 4/345)
This is indicated by the Quran and Sunnah.  
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days.” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
Whoever sets out during the day is “on a journey” so he may break his fast and avail himself of the concession granted to travelers. 
With regard to the Sunnah, Ahmad (26690) and Abu Dawud (2412) narrated that ‘Ubayd ibn Jabr said: I traveled with Abu Basrah al-Ghifari, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), in a ship from al-Fustat in Ramadan. He set off then lunch was brought (according to a report narrated by Ahmad: when we set off from Marsana he ordered that his food be brought). Then he said: ‘Come and eat.’ I said, ‘Can’t we still see the houses?’ Abu Basrah said: ‘Don’t you want to follow the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)?!’ 
Ibn al-Qayyim said in Tahdhib al-Sunan: 
“This is evidence for those who say that it is permissible for the traveler to break his fast on the day on which he travels during the day. This is one of the two reports narrated from Imam Ahmad, and the view of ‘Amr ibn Shurahbil, al-Shu’bi and Ishaq. It was also narrated from Anas and it is the view of Dawud and Ibn al-Mundhir.”  
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 25/212. 
“If a traveler sets out during the day, is it permissible for him to break his fast? There are two well-known scholarly views, both of which were narrated from Ahmad. The more likely to be correct says that that is permissible, as it is proven in al-Sunan that some of the Sahabah used to break the fast if they set out during the day, and they said that this was the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). And it is proven in al-Sahih that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) intended to fast on a journey then he called for water and broke his fast while the people were looking on.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/217) 
When can a traveler break his fast?
But he should not do that until he has started his journey and left his city. It is not permissible for him to break his fast while he is still in his city. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (6/218): 
“If he sets out during the day, he is allowed to break his fast, but is that subject to the condition that he leaves his village first, or if he has decided to travel can he break his fast (before departure)? 
The answer is that two views have been narrated from the salaf. The correct view is that he should not break his fast until he has left his city or village , because he is not yet traveling, rather he has the intention of traveling. Hence it is not permissible for him to shorten his prayers until he has left his town, so by the same token it is not permissible for him to break his fast until he has left his town.”

Majallat al-Buhooth al-Islamiyyah, 68/53. 
This is with regard to its being permissible. However what is better and closer to the Sunnah is for each person to make du’aa’ individually. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said concerning du’aa’ offered together: 
This is not part of the Sunnah of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or the way of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs (may Allaah be pleased with them), rather the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to tell them to pray for forgiveness for the deceased and ask for him to be made steadfast, individually and not together.”

Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) connected the ruling on this matter (shortening of prayers) to travel. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And when you (Muslims) travel in the land, there is no sin on you if you shorten As-Salaah (the prayer) if you fear that the disbelievers may put you in trial (attack you), verily, the disbelievers are ever unto you open enemies” [al-Nisa 4:101]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The prayer when travelling is two rak’ahs.” Narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 1420; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has waived half the prayer for the traveller.” Narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 2275; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i. 
This is also indicated by the fact that it is not permissible for the non-traveller to shorten his prayers even if offering the prayer in full is difficult for him, which indicates that this ruling applies only to travel, not to difficulty. 
The Standing Committee was asked: If a person travels a long distance by plane, but it only takes two hours or less, can this traveller shorten his prayers and break his fast in Ramadaan or not? Similarly if a person travels by car for two hundred miles or more in two and a half hours, for example, and comes back home in the evening, and he shortens his prayers, is this permissible or is it not permissible unless he faces difficulty and exhaustion when travelling? 
He replied: 
Shortening the prayer when travelling the distances mentioned is Sunnah, and breaking the fast in such cases is a concession that is granted to the traveller, whether it takes him a long time or a short time to cross that distance, and whether that causes him hardship or not, because what is assumed is that travelling involves hardship, even if that does not actually happen. This is the bounty and mercy of Allah towards His slaves.

    that Allaah alone has ownership and that no one owns created beings except 
    their Creator, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

    “And to Allaah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the 
    earth”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:189] 

    “Say: “In Whose Hand is the sovereignty of everything”

    [al-Mu’minoon 23:88]
With regard to 
    verses which speak of ownership belonging to someone other than Allaah, such 
    as the verses (interpretation of the meaning):

    “Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their right 
    hands possess,  
    for then, they are free from blame”

    [al-Mu’minoon 23:6] 

    “or (from that) whereof you hold keys”

    [al-Noor 24:61]

    this differs from the ownership that is attributed to Allaah 
    in several ways, such as: 

    1-The ownership of a created 
    being is limited and only includes a few of these created things. A man may 
    own that which is under his control, but he does not own that which is under 
    the control of others.

    2-It is limited, not absolute. A 
    man does not own that which he has in the fullest sense of the word. Hence 
    he can only dispose of it in ways that are permitted in sharee’ah. For 
    example, if he wants to burn his wealth or torture his animal, we say that 
    this is not permitted. But Allaah owns things in a complete and 
    comprehensive sense.

    With regard to saying that Allaah is the only disposer of 
    affairs, this means that a person believes that Allaah is the Only One Who 
    is in control, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Say (O Muhammad): ‘Who provides for you from the sky and 
    the earth? Or who owns hearing and sight? And who brings out the living from 
    the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who disposes the 
    affairs?’ They will say: ‘Allaah.’ Say: ‘Will you not then be afraid of 
    Allaah’s punishment (for setting up rivals in worship with Allaah)?’

    Such is Allaah, your Lord in truth. So after the truth, 
    what else can there be, save error? How then are you turned away?”

    [Yoonus 10:31]
With regard to a 
    man’s disposal of affairs, it is limited to that which is under his control 
    and that which is permitted to him by sharee’ah.
Based on this, 
    there is nothing wrong with attributing ownership and disposal of affairs to 
    a person, but this sovereignty and disposal of affairs is limited. There is 
    no one who owns and controls all things in a comprehensive sense except 
    Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. And Allaah knows best.

Is this correct?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Giving money to those whose hearts are to be opened is not a bribe, because a bribe is money which a person gives to someone to help him to avoid a duty or to get something to which he is not entitled. But giving money in order to soften a person’s heart and open it towards Islam is helping them to discover the truth and encouraging them to follow it by entering Islam. It is a kind of jihad using money. 
Allah has allocated a share of zakah for those whose hearts are to be softened, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“As-Sadaqaat (here it means Zakah) are only for the Fuqaraa’ (poor), and Al-Masaakeen (the poor) and those employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islam)…”
[al-Tawbah 9:60]
This share should be taken to the ruler and given to those who he sees are close to accepting Islam. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave those whose hearts were to be softened wealth from the spoils of the battle of Hunayn, which led to entire tribes becoming Muslim. This is an ongoing issue, and one of the means of da’wah that should be revived, because people are naturally inclined to like those who are kind to them: 
“Be kind to people and you will capture their hearts
How often has kindness made people treat you like a master.”

The correct attitude for the Muslim, if he sees a clear and unambiguous text concerning some matter – whether it coincides with current custom, or with western culture, or not – is that he should follow it without any kind of embarrassment or fear, and whether he knows the wisdom behind it or not.

Support of the view that ‘Eid prayer is obligatory","Praise be to Allah.Is ‘Eid prayer obligatory?
The scholars differed concerning the ruling on ‘Eid prayers . There are three scholarly points of view: 

That ‘Eid prayer is Sunnah mu’akkadah (a confirmed Sunnah). This is the view of Imam Malik and Imam al-Shafi'i. 
That it is a communal obligation. This is the view of Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him). 
That it is a duty for each Muslim and is obligatory for men; those who do not do it with no excuse are sinning thereby. This is the view of Imam Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him), and was also narrated from Imam Ahmad. Among those who favoured this view were Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and al-Shawkani (may Allah have mercy on them). (Al-Majmu’, 5/5; al-Mughni, 3/253; al-Insaf, 5/316; al-Ikhtiyarat, p. 82)

Support of the view that ‘Eid prayer is obligatory
Those who held the third view quoted several texts as evidence, including the following:

The verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Therefore turn in prayer to your Lord and sacrifice (to Him only).” [al-Kawthar 108:2]
Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni: “The well-known view is that what is meant by this is the ‘Eid prayer.” 
Some of the scholars were of the view that what is meant in this verse is prayer in general, not just ‘Eid prayer, so what the verse means is that we are commanded to devote our prayer and sacrifice to Allah Alone, so it is like the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘Verily, my Salah (prayer), my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of the ‘Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists)’” [al-An’am 6:162]
This view concerning this meaning of the verse was shared by Ibn Jarir (12/724) and Ibn Kathir (8/502). 

The fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded the people to go out to it (the ‘Eid prayer) and even commanded the women to go out too.

Al-Bukhari (324) and Muslim (890) narrated that Umm ‘Atiyyah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us to bring them (women) out on (‘Eid) al-Fitr and (‘Eid) al-Adha, and to bring out adolescent girls, menstruating women and virgins, but the menstruating women were to stay away from the prayer, but were to witness goodness and the gathering of the Muslims. I said: “O Messenger of Allah, what if one of us does not have a jilbab?” He said: “Let her sister lend her a jilbab.”  
The evidence of this hadith that the ‘Eid prayer is obligatory is stronger than the evidence of the verse quoted above. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said in Majmu’ al-Fatawa (16/214): 
“What I think is that the ‘Eid prayer is fard ‘ayn (an individual obligation), and that it is not permissible for men to miss it, rather they have to attend, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined that. He even commanded the women – including virgins and those who usually stayed in seclusion – to come out to the ‘Eid prayer, and he commanded menstruating women to come out to the ‘Eid prayer , but told them to keep away from the prayer-place itself. This indicates that it is confirmed.” 
He also said (16/217): 
“What seems more likely to be correct in my view, based on the evidence, is that it is fard ‘ayn (an individual obligation), and that it is obligatory for every male to attend the ‘Eid prayer apart from those who have an excuse.” 
Shaykh Ibn Baz said in Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 13/7 concerning the view that it is fard ‘ayn: 
“This view is more likely to be correct, based on the evidence.”

    What we say about interacting with the Shi’ah depends on the 
    situation. The innovated beliefs of the Shi’ah vary. If it is something that 
    does not put them beyond the pale of Islam, but is rather regarded as 
    drifting away from the right path, such as their claiming to be devoted to 
    Ahl al-Bayt (the family of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him)), then it is permissible to greet them first, because they are 
    Muslims who have committed acts of innovation and sin that do not put them 
    beyond the pale of Islam, and we have to advise them and direct them towards 
    the Sunnah and the truth, and warn them against innovation and sin. If they 
    follow right guidance and accept advice, then praise be to Allaah, for this 
    is what we want. But if they persist in following innovation, then they 
    should be forsaken until they repent to Allaah and give up their innovations 
    and evil ways, because this is a kind of punishment for them. If something 
    good can be achieved by means of this forsaking, or something bad warded 
    off, then it is prescribed in sharee’ah, but if this forsaking will result 
    in something that will increase the evil caused by their innovations, then 
    it is not prescribed. 

    If you think that not forsaking them will serve a greater 
    interest and that mixing with them and advising them is more useful in 
    opening their hearts to true religion, then there is nothing wrong with not 
    forsaking them, because the aim behind forsaking them is to direct them to 
    the right way and to make them feel that we do not approve of their ways, so 
    that they may come back to true Islam.

    If forsaking them will harm the Muslims’ interests and make 
    them cling more firmly to their false ways and put them off the truth, then 
    it is better not to do that, just as the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) did not forsake ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Ubayy ibn Salool, the 
    leader of the hypocrites, because not forsaking him was more in the 
    interests of the Muslims. 

    But if their bid’ah constitutes kufr, such as cursing the 
    Sahaabah and exaggerating about ‘Ali and Faatimah and al-Hasan and al-Husayn 
    (may Allaah be pleased with them), and they pray to them and seek their help 
    and ask them for support and so on, or their belief that they have knowledge 
    of the unseen etc, which means that they are beyond the pale of Islam, then 
    in this case it is not permissible to greet them first or to befriend them 
    or to eat meat slaughtered by them. Rather we must hate them and disavow 
    ourselves of them, until they believe in Allaah alone, because in this case 
    they are kaafirs and apostates. See Majmoo’ Fataawa Shaykh al-Islam, 
    28/216-217; Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 4/262-263 
It should be noted here 
    that it is not permissible to greet a kaafir first in general terms, such as 
    saying Ahlan wa sahlan (welcome) and so on, because that involves honouring 
    them and venerating them, and the Muslim is higher in status before Allaah, 
    so we should not greet them first. But if they say that to us then we may 
    greet them in the same manner as they greeted us, because Islam is the 
    religion of justice that came to give each person his rights.

Some said that it is valid to observe i’tikaaf in any mosque, even if prayers in congregation are not held there, based on the general meaning of the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And do not have sexual relations with them (your wives) while you are in I‘tikaaf (i.e. confining oneself in a mosque for prayers and invocations leaving the worldly activities) in the mosques”
[al-Baqarah 2:187]
Imam Ahmad was of the view that it is conditional upon it being in a mosque in which prayers are held in congregation. He quoted the following evidence for that: 
1 – The words of ‘Aa’ishah: “There should be no i’tikaaf except in a mosque in which prayers in congregation are held (masjid jamaa’ah).” Narrated by al-Bayhaqi, classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in his essay Qiyaam Ramadaan. 
2 – Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “There should be no i’tikaaf except in a mosque in which prayer is established.” Al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 5/212. 
3 – If a person observes i’tikaaf in a mosque in which prayers in congregation are not held, this will lead to one of two things: 
(i)Either he will miss prayer in congregation, and it is not permissible for a man to miss prayer in congregation without a valid excuse.
(ii)Or he will go out a great deal in order to pray in another mosque, which defeats the purpose of i’tikaaf.
See al-Mughni, 4/461. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (6/312): 
I’tikaaf is not valid unless it is observed in a mosque in which people gather (to pray)?
Is what is meant a mosque in which Jumu’ah prayers are held, or one in which prayers in congregation (jamaa’ah) are held? 
The answer is: a mosque in which prayers in congregation are held; it does not have to be one in which Jumu’ah prayers are held, because the mosque in which prayers in congregation are not held is not a mosque in the true sense of the word, such as if the mosque has been abandoned by its people or they have moved away. 
It is not essential that the mosque be one in which Jumu’ah prayers are held, because Jumu’ah does not happen repeatedly and going out to attend Jumu’ah does not affect i’tikaaf, unlike the five daily prayers which happen repeatedly every day and night. 
This condition – that the mosque be one in which prayers are held in congregation – applies if the person observing i’tikaaf is a man. If it is a woman, her i’tikaaf is valid in any mosque, even if it is one in which prayers are not held in congregation, because prayer in congregation is not obligatory for woman. 
Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni: 
A woman may observe i’tikaaf in any mosque; it does not have to be one in which prayers are held in congregation, because that is not obligatory for women. This is the view of al-Shaafa’i. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (6/313):

What religion existed before Prophet Muhammad?


Specific meaning of Islam","Praise be to Allah.General meaning of Islam
It should be noted that the word “Islam ” may refer to two things: a general meaning and a specific meaning. 
Islam in a general sense means submitting to Allah Alone, which implies worshipping Him Alone and obeying Him Alone. 
Everyone who believes in Allah Alone and worships Him according to His laws that have not been abrogated is a Muslim. 
Shaykh al-Islam said in al-Tadmuriyyah, p. 168-170: 
“This religion is the religion of Islam , besides which Allah will accept no other religion, either from the earlier or the later generations. All the Prophets followed Islam. Allah says of Nuh (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And recite to them the news of Nuh (Noah). When he said to his people: ‘O my people, if my stay (with you), and my reminding (you) of the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah is hard on you, then I put my trust in Allah. So devise your plot, you and your partners, and let not your plot be in doubt for you. Then pass your sentence on me and give me no respite.
72. ‘But if you turn away (from accepting my doctrine of Islamic Monotheism, i.e. to worship none but Allah), then no reward have I asked of you, my reward is only from Allah, and I have been commanded to be of the Muslims (i.e. those who submit to Allah’s Will).’” [Yunus 10:71-72]
And Allah says of Ibrahim (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And who turns away from the religion of Ibrahim (Abraham) (i.e. Islamic Monotheism ) except him who befools himself? Truly, We chose him in this world and verily, in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous. When his Lord said to him, ‘Submit (i.e. be a Muslim)!’ He said, ‘I have submitted myself (as a Muslim) to the Lord of the ‘Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists).’ And this (submission to Allah, Islam) was enjoined by Ibrahim (Abraham) upon his sons and by Ya’qub (Jacob) (saying), ‘O my sons! Allah has chosen for you the (true) religion, then die not except in the Faith of Islam (as Muslims — Islamic Monotheism).’” [al-Baqarah 2:130-132]
And He says of Musa (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And Musa (Moses) said: ‘O my people! If you have believed in Allah, then put your trust in Him if you are Muslims (those who submit to Allah’s Will).’” [Yunus 10:84]
And He says of the Messiah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And when I (Allah) inspired Al-Hawariyyun (the disciples) [of ‘Isa (Jesus)] to believe in Me and My Messenger, they said: ‘We believe. And bear witness that we are Muslims.’” [al-Maidah 5:111]
And He says of the previous Prophets (interpretation of the meaning): 
“…by which the Prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah’s Will …” [al-Maidah 5:44]
And He tells us that Bilqis said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“My Lord! Verily, I have wronged myself, and I submit [in Islam, together with Sulayman (Solomon)] to Allah, the Lord of the ‘Alamin(mankind, jinn and all that exists).” [al-Naml 27:44]
This is the religion of Islam , besides which Allah does not accept any other. This means obeying Allah at any given time by doing what He commanded at that time. So initially the command was to face towards the Rock [in Jerusalem] in prayer, then the command came to face towards the Ka’bah. Both actions come under the heading of the religion of Islam, because religion is obedience and worship in both cases, but the actions varied in some regards which was the direction faced in prayer. Similarly the religion of all the Messengers is one and the same, but their laws varied.” 
With this general meaning of the word “Islam ” in mind, it is correct to say that there was a religion called Islam before the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sent. 
All the Prophets who were sent were Muslims, and their followers who adhered to their true religion, before it was distorted or abrogated, were Muslims. 
What religion existed before Prophet Muhammad?
Before the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came there were a few individuals who followed the true religion with which Allah had sent ‘Isa (peace be upon him). This is indicated by the report narrated by Muslim (2865) from ‘Iyad ibn Himar al-Mujashi’i, that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said one day in his khutbah: “Allah looked at the people of the earth and was angry with them all, Arabs and non-Arabs, except for the remainder of the People of the Book. And He said: ‘I have only sent you to test you and test others by you…’”  
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
Maqt (translated here as “angry”) means extreme anger. Looking refers to the time before the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sent. What is meant by the remainder of the People of the Book is those who continued to adhere to their true religion without altering it. End quote.

In this specific sense, it is not correct to say that there was a religion called Islam before the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sent.

This is a semantic dispute, because Islam in the specific sense with which Allah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the law of the Quran is not followed by anyone except the ummah of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). This is what is meant by Islam nowadays. But with regard to Islam in a general sense, referring to every law with which Allah sent one of His prophets, this includes the Islam of every nation that followed one of the prophets.”

The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) did ghusl on the day of ‘Eid. There is nothing wrong with doing ghusl for ‘Eid before Fajr prayer if that will make it easier to go out to the ‘Eid prayer.,"Is ghusl compulsory on ‘Eid?


Time for ghusl on ‘Eid","Praise be to Allah.Is ghusl compulsory on ‘Eid?
Doing ghusl on ‘Eid is mustahabb. It was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did ghusl on the day of ‘Eid. 
It was also narrated that some of the Companions did ghusl on the day of ‘Eid , such as `Ali ibn Abi Talib, Salamah ibn al-Akwa’ and Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them). 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu’: 
“All the isnads (of these reports) are weak and false except the report of Ibn ‘Umar. The evidence which may be taken as proof that it is mustahabb is the report of Ibn ‘Umar, and analogy with Jumu`ah.” 
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
“There are two weak hadiths concerning this matter, but it was proven from Ibn `Umar, who was very keen to follow the Sunnah, that he used to do ghusl for ‘Eid before going out.” 
Time for ghusl on ‘Eid
With regard to the time when one should do ghusl for ‘Eid , it is better to do that after Fajr prayer, but if one does it before Fajr that is sufficient, because of the shortness of time available after Fajr, because the people need to go to offer the ‘Eid prayer and the prayer place may be far away. 
It says in al-Muntaqa Sharh Muwatta al-Imam Malik: 
“It is mustahabb to do ghusl just before going out to the prayer-place. Ibn Habib said that the best time to do ghusl for ‘Eid is after praying Fajr. Malik said in al-Mukhtasar that if one does ghusl for ‘Eid before Fajr that is acceptable.” 
In Sharh Mukhtasar (2/102), Khalil said that the time for ghusl for ‘Eid is during the last one-sixth of the night.
 Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni: 
“The time for ghusl (for ‘Eid) is after the dawn comes, according to the apparent meaning of al-Khiraqi’s words. Al-Qadi and al-Amidi said: Ghusl before Fajr does not fulfil the Sunnah of doing ghusl, because the ghusl for a prayer should be done on that day and doing it before dawn does not meet that condition, as is the case with ghusl for Jumu’ah. Ibn ‘Aqil said: What is mentioned in the texts from Ahmad is (that it may be done) before Fajr and after, because the time for ‘Eid is more limited than the time for Jumu’ah, so if it is limited to the time after Fajr one may not be able to do it. And because the purpose behind it is to cleanse oneself, which may be achieved by doing ghusl at night because it is close to the time of prayer. But it is better to do it after Fajr, so as to avoid an area of scholarly dispute and to be more clean, because that is closer to the time of prayer.” 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu’: 
“Concerning the time when this ghusl is valid, there are two well-known opinions. The view that it should be after dawn breaks was stated in al-Umm and the more correct view according to scholarly consensus is that it is permissible to do it both after Fajr and before. 
Al-Qadi Abu al-Tayyib said in his book al-Mujarrad, al-Shafi’i stated in al-Buwayti that ghusl for ‘Eid is valid before dawn breaks. 
Al-Nawawi said: If we say that according to the more correct view it is valid before dawn, then the most sound and most well-known view is that it is valid after half the night has passed, but it is not valid before then. The second view is that it is valid at any time of the night. This was the view of al-Ghazali, and was the view favoured by Ibn al-Sabbagh and others. The third view is that it is only valid just before Fajr. This was the view of al-Baghawi.” 
Based on this, there is nothing wrong with doing ghusl for ‘Eid before Fajr prayer if that will make it easier to go out to the ‘Eid prayer .

The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: 
Is the adhaan Sunnah for the prescribed obligatory prayers, and what is the ruling on giving it from a cassette recorder if there is no muezzin who can do it properly? 
They replied: 
The adhaan is fard kifaayah (a communal obligation), in addition to it being an announcement that the time for prayer has begun and an invitation to come and pray. It is not sufficient to play a recording of the adhaan when the time for prayer comes. The Muslims in all areas in which regular prayer is established have to appoint one of their number who can do it properly when the time for prayer begins. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz, Shaykh ‘Abd al-Razzaaq ‘Afeefi and Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Ghadyaan. They were also asked: 
I have heard that some people in Muslim countries record the adhaan from the Two Holy Sanctuaries and broadcast that by loudspeaker instead of the muezzin giving the adhaan. Is the prayer permissible (if this is done)? Please quote evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnah, with simple commentary. 
They replied: 
It is not sufficient for the adhaan which is prescribed for the obligatory prayers to be given by means of a tape on which the adhaan is recorded. Rather the muezzin has to give the call to prayer himself, because it was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded that the adhaan be given, and the basic principle concerning a command is that it is obligatory. 
Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 6/66, 67 
The Islamic Fiqh Council of the Muslim World League issued a statement, during its ninth conference in Makkah al-Mukarramah in 1406 AH, as follows: 
Broadcasting the adhaan from the mosques when the time for prayer begins by means of a recorder and the like is not sufficient and is not permissible with regard to this act of worship. This does not count as the proper adhaan as prescribed in sharee’ah. The Muslims must give the adhaan directly for each and every time of prayer, in each mosque, in the manner that has been passed down from generation to generation among the Muslims from the time of our Prophet and Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) until the present.

    a serious mistake for which there is no basis in sharee’ah.

The main reason for this is that I have become Muslim… we got married in the Islamic manner, but this marriage was done without the knowledge of our families, because of some difficult circumstances.
Do you think that this is haraam? I mean, is it against the Quran?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The evidence from the Quran and Sunnah indicates that a woman should not get married without a wali (guardian) to look after her and protect her interests, lest she be deceived by the devils among men. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Wed them with the permission of their own folk (guardians, Awliyaa’ or masters)” [al-Nisa’ 4:25]
It was narrated from Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no (valid) marriage without a wali (guardian).” Narrated by the five and classed as saheeh by Ibn al-Madeeni. 
Al-Tirmidhi said: This is the correct view concerning this issue, based on the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “There is no marriage without a wali (guardian),” according to the scholars among the companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), such as ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib, ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abbaas, Abu Hurayrah and others. 
If one of your close male relatives is a Muslim, such as your father, brother, uncle or cousin, then he is your wali with regard to marriage, and your marriage is not valid without his permission and consent. He should do the marriage contract for you himself or appoint someone to do it on his behalf. 
If all your close male relatives are non-Muslims, then a kaafir cannot be the wali (guardian) of a Muslim. 
Ibn Qudaamah said: With regard to a kaafir, he cannot be the wali of a Muslim in any situation, according to scholarly consensus. 
Ibn al-Mundhir said: Those from whom we acquired knowledge are unanimously agreed on that. 
Imam Ahmad said: We have heard that ‘Ali allowed a marriage done by a brother, but he rejected a marriage done by a father who was a Christian. Al-Mughni, 7/356. 
And a Muslim cannot be a guardian for the marriage of his kaafir children’s marriage. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was asked about a man who had become Muslim; could he still be a wali for his children who were people of the Book? 
He replied: He cannot be their guardian with regard to marriage, or with regard to inheritance. A Muslim cannot do the marriage contract for a kaafir woman, whether she is his daughter or anyone else. And a kaafir cannot inherit from a Muslim or a Muslim from a kaafir. This is the view of the four imams and their companions among the earlier and later generations. Allah has severed the ties of guardianship between believers and disbelievers in His Book, and has decreed that they should have nothing to do with one another, and that the ties of wilaayah (guardianship) exist among the believers. (32/35) But a Muslim woman should tell her family about that and seek their approval, so that this will help to open their hearts to Islam. 
The question here is: what should a Muslim woman who does not have a Muslim wali do? 
The answer is: 
A Muslim who is in a position of authority or status should do the marriage contract for her, such as the head of an Islamic centre, the imam of a mosque, or a scholar. If she cannot find anyone like this, then she should appoint a Muslim man of good character to do the marriage contract for her. 
Shaykh al-Islam said: In the case of a woman who does not have a wali among her relatives, if there is in her locality a representative of the ruler or the chief of the village, or a leader who is obeyed, then he can do the marriage contract for her with her permission. (32/35). 
Ibn Qudaamah said: 
If a woman does not have a wali or a ruler, then there is a report narrated from Ahmad which indicates that a man of good character may do the marriage contract for her with her permission. (7/352). 
Al-Juwayni said: If she does not have a wali present, and there is no (Muslim) ruler, then we know definitively that closing the door of marriage is impossible in sharee’ah, and whoever has any doubt about that does not have a proper understanding of sharee’ah. To suggest that the door of marriage may be closed is as bad as suggesting that people may be prevented from earning a living. Al-Ghayaathi 388. Then he stated that the ones who should do that (do marriage contracts for women who have no wali) are the scholars. 
Conclusion: 
If the marriage contract was done in this manner, and the imam of an Islamic Centre in your country or a Muslim man of good character did the marriage, then your marriage is valid. But if you did the marriage yourself (with no wali) then you have to go with your husband to the nearest Islamic centre and repeat the nikaah (marriage contract), and let the head of the centre, for example, be your wali in marriage. 
With regard to your husband, he does not have to tell his family, because there is no stipulation that the husband should have a wali.

    Whoever believes that a child may be given by someone other 
    than Allaah or that anyone other than Allaah can increase or reduce 
    provision, is a mushrik whose shirk is worse than that of the pre-Islamic 
    Arabs and others in the Jaahiliyyah. The Arabs and others like them, if they 
    were asked who granted them provision from the heavens and the earth, or who 
    brought forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living, would 
    reply, ‘Allaah.” They only worshipped their false gods because they believed 
    that they would bring them closer to Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 

    “Say (O Muhammad): ‘Who provides for you from the sky and 
    the earth? Or who owns hearing and sight? And who brings out the living from 
    the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who disposes the 
    affairs?’ They will say: ‘Allaah.’ Say: ‘Will you not then be afraid of 
    Allaah’s punishment (for setting up rivals in worship with Allaah)?’”

    “And those who take Awliyaa’ (protectors, helpers, lords, 
    gods) besides Him (say): ‘We worship them only that they may bring us near 
    to Allaah.’ Verily, Allaah will judge between them concerning that wherein 
    they differ. Truly, Allaah guides not him who is a liar, and a disbeliever”

    [al-Zumar 39:3] 

    “Who is he that can provide for you if He should withhold 
    His provision?”

    [al-Mulk 67:21]
It is narrated in the 
    Sunnah that the power to grant or withhold belongs to Allaah alone. For 
    example al-Bukhaari (844) and Muslim (593) narrated from al-Mugheerah ibn 
    Shu’bah that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    used to say after each prescribed prayer: “Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu 
    laa shareeka lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in 
    qadeer, Allaahumma laa maani’ lima a’tayta wa laa mu’ti lima mana’ta wa la

    with no partner or associate, His is the sovereignty and to Him be praise 
    and He is able to do all things. O Allaah, none can withhold what You give 
    and none can give what You withhold, and no wealth or majesty can benefit 
    anyone for from You is all wealth and majesty).”
But Allaah may give His 
    slave children or increase his provision because of his praying to Him and 
    turning to Him alone, as is clearly demonstrated in Soorat Ibraaheem, where 
    Ibraaheem al-Khaleel prays to his Lord and Allaah answers his prayer, and in 
    Soorat Maryam and Soorat al-Anbiya’ and elsewhere, where Zakariya prays to 
    his Lord and He answers his prayer. And it was narrated that Anas (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: Whoever would like to have 
    his provision increased and his life span extended, let him uphold the ties 
    of kinship.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2067; Muslim, 2557. and Allaah knows

Who will drink and will not drink from al-Kawthar?","Praise be to Allah.What is al-Kawthar?
The word kawthar in Arabic refers to great abundance. 
In Islamic terminology, al-Kawthar has two meanings: 

It is a river in Paradise which Allah has given to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). This meaning is what is meant in the verse where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Verily, We have granted you (O Muhammad) Al-Kawthar (a river in Paradise).” [Al-Kawthar 108:1]
This is how the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) interpreted it. It was narrated by Muslim in his Sahih (607) that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Whilst we were with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), he dozed off then he raised his head and he was smiling. We said, “Why are you smiling, O Messenger of Allah?” He said: “A surah has been revealed to me.” And he recited (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, We have granted you (O Muhammad) Al-Kawthar (a river in Paradise)…” [Al-Kawthar 108:1] to the end of the surah. Then he said: “Do you know what al-Kawthar is?” We said: Allah and His Messenger know best.” He said: “It is a river that my Lord has promised to me in which there is much goodness. And it is a cistern to which my ummah will come on the Day of Resurrection .” 
Al-Tirmidhi (3284) narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Al-Kawthar is a river in Paradise. Its banks are made of gold and its bed is of pearls and rubies…” Al-Tirmidhi said: “It is hasan sahih.” It was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 3/135. 

It is a great cistern – a tank for holding water – which will be set up in the place of gathering on the Day of Resurrection, to which the ummah of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will come. 

The water of this cistern will come from the river of al-Kawthar which is in Paradise, hence it is called the Cistern of al-Kawthar. The evidence for that is the hadith narrated by Muslim in his Sahih (4255) from Abu Dharr, that “into the Cistern will flow two pipes from Paradise.” The apparent meaning of this hadith is that the Cistern will be next to Paradise so that the water from the river that is inside Paradise will be able to flow into it, as Ibn Hajar said in al-Fath 11/466. And Allah knows best. 
Is al-Kawthar only for Prophet Muhammad?
But is al-Kawthar only for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to the exclusion of other prophets, or not? 

With regard to the river of al-Kawthar from which water will flow into the Cistern, there is no report of any other prophet having anything like it, apart from our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Allah states that He has blessed him with it in Surat al-Kawthar, so it is likely that this is only for our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and not for any other prophet. 
With regard to the Cistern of al-Kawthar, it is well known among the scholars that it is only for our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Among those who stated this was al-Qurtubi in al-Mufahhim. 

But al-Tirmidhi (2367) narrated that Samurah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every Prophet will have a cistern and they will be looking to see who has the largest number of followers coming to him, and I hope that I will have the largest number.” All the isnads of this hadith are weak , but some of the scholars ruled that it is acceptable because it has so many isnads, as al-Albani said in al-Sahihah, 1589. Some of them ruled that it is weak (da’if). Even if this hadith cannot be proven, it is not unlikely that the Cistern will also be only for our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to the exclusion of others. And Allah knows best. 
Characteristics of al-Kawthar
The characteristics of the river that is in Paradise and the Cistern that will be set up in the place of gathering were narrated in the sahih Sunnah. 
The characteristics of the river of al-Kawthar that will be in Paradise include the following: 
Al-Bukhari narrated in his Sahih from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whilst I was walking in Paradise, I saw a river whose banks were domes of hollow pearls.” I said, “What is this, O Jibril?” He said: “This is al-Kawthar which your Lord has given to you.” The angel struck it with his hand and its mud or its perfume was of the most fragrant (or pure) musk. 
In al-Musnad (12084) it was narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have been given al-Kawthar, and it is a river that flows on the face of the earth. Its banks are domes of pearls and it is not covered. I struck its dust with my hand and its dust was the most fragrant (or pure) musk, and its pebbles were pearls.” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Sahihah, 2513. 
According to another report narrated in al-Musnad (12827) also from Anas, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about al-Kawthar and he said: “That is a river which Allah has given to me, in Paradise. It is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey, and in it are birds whose necks are like the necks of camels.” ‘Umar said: “Those are soft birds.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Eating them is even softer, O ‘Umar.” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Targhib wa’l-Tarhib, 3740. 
Features of al-Hawd
With regard to the features of the Cistern that will be in the place of gathering, they include the following: 
Al-Bukhari (6093) and Muslim (4244) narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “My Cistern is (as big as) the distance of a month’s (journey). Its length and width are equal and its water is whiter than milk and its scent is better than musk. Its drinking vessels are like the stars of the sky and whoever drinks from it will never thirst again.” 
In Sahih Muslim (4261) it is narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “In it can be seen vessels of gold and silver whose number is as the stars of the sky.” According to another report, “More than the number of stars in the sky.” 
It is also narrated in Sahih Muslim (4256) from Thawban (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about its drink and he said: “It is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey. Two pipes feed into it from Paradise, one of gold and the other of silver.” 
Authenticity of Hadiths about al-Hawd
There is no doubt among the scholars that the hadiths about the Cistern reach the level of being mutawatir (i.e., narrated by so many people from so many people that it is inconceivable that they could all agree upon a lie). It was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) by more than fifty of his Companions. 
Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar listed the names of the Companions who narrated these hadiths in al-Fath (11/468). And al-Qurtubi said in al-Mufahhim Sharh Sahih Muslim: “Every Muslim has to understand and believe that Allah has singled out His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to be given the Cistern, the name and features of which and its drink are mentioned in the well known sahih hadiths which, when taken together, constitute definitive knowledge. 
Location of al-Hawd
With regard to where the Cistern will be located in the land of gathering, the scholars differed concerning this matter. Some said that it will be after the Siraat (bridge across Hell). Others said that it will be before the Sirat. This is the view of the majority and is more likely to be correct – and Allah knows best – because some of those who come to it will be taken to Hell, and if it were after the Sirat they would not be able to reach it because they would already have fallen into Hell – we seek refuge with Allah. 
We must also draw attention to a very important and serious matter which is that not everyone who belongs to the ummah of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will attain the honour of drinking from the Cistern of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The hadiths clearly state that there are some people among this ummah who will be driven back harshly from the Cistern – we ask Allah to keep us safe from that. 
Who will drink and will not drink from al-Kawthar?
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has answered this question clearly in such a way that no one has any excuse. Muslim narrated in his Sahih (367) from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to the graveyard and said: “Peace be upon you, O habitation of believing people. We will join you soon, if Allah wills. Would that we had seen our brothers.” They said, “Are we not your brothers, O Messenger of Allah?” He said: “You are my companions. Our brothers are those who have not yet come.” They said: “How will you recognize those among your ummah who have not yet come, O Messenger of Allah?” He said: “If a man has a horse with a white blaze and white feet among horses that are all black, don’t you think that he will recognize his horse?” They said: “Of course, O Messenger of Allah.” He said: “They will come with white foreheads and white hands and feet because of wudu’. I will have reached the Cistern ahead of them and men will be driven away from my Cistern as stray camels are driven away. (I will say), ‘Let them come,’ and it will said to me, ‘They changed after you were gone,’ so I will say, ‘Away with them!’” 
In al-Bukhari (6528) and Muslim (4243) it is narrated that Abu Hazim said: I heard Sahl say: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “I will reach the Cistern ahead of you. Whoever comes to it will drink and whoever drinks from it will never thirst again. Some people will come to me whom I will recognize and they will recognize me, but then a barrier will be placed between me and them.” 
Abu Hazim said: al-Nu'man ibn Abi ‘Ayyaash heard me narrating this hadith and said: “Is that how you heard Sahl say it?” I said, “Yes.” He said: “I bear witness that I heard Abu Sa’id al-Khudri add: and he [meaning the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] said: ‘They are from me.” And it will be said; “You do not know what they did after you were gone.” And I will say, “Away with those who changed after I was gone!”’” 
It was narrated by al-Bukhari (2194) and Muslim (4257) from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, I will drive men away from my Cistern as strange camels are driven away from a cistern.” 
Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Our scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) said: Everyone who apostatizes from the religion of Allah or who introduces innovations with which Allah is not pleased and did not give permission for is one of those who will be driven away from the Cistern. Those who will be most forcibly driven away will be those who differed from the majority of Muslims and split from them, such as the Kharijis and Rafidis of all stripes, and the Mu’tazilis and anyone who followed their ways. The same applies to the evildoers and oppressors who tried to extinguish the truth and kill its followers and humiliate them, and those who openly committed major sins and took the matter of sin lightly, and all those who followed deviant whims and desires and innovation.” (Al-Tadhkirah by al-Qurtubi, 306) 
So we must strive to follow the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and not go against him in any way, in the hope that Allah will honour us by allowing us to drink from this blessed Cistern . Otherwise what regret can be greater than the regret of the one who is pushed away from before the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and suffers unbearable thirst but is not allowed to drink that cool water, then his loss is further compounded by the prayer of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that he be driven far away? We seek refuge with Allah. Imagine this torment – what if you were actually to experience it? 
We ask Allah to bless us and our Muslim brothers will guidance to follow the Sunnah and to avoid bid’ah (innovation) and sin. Amin. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.

It is not Sunnah for him to omit any of the supererogatory prayers apart from the regular Sunnah prayers before and after Dhuhr and the regular Sunnah prayers of Maghrib and `Isha’. 
Apart from that, the traveller may offer any of the Sunnah prayers. Muslim (680) narrated from Abu Qatadah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed the regular Sunnah prayer of Fajr when travelling . 
It was also proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed Duha with eight Rak`ahs in Makkah on the day when Allah enabled him to conquer Makkah. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 357 and Muslim, 336) 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed Witr when travelling . (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1000) 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:  
“With regard to the regular Sunnah prayers , I have studied what was narrated in the Sunnah concerning the supererogatory prayers, and it seems to me that the regular Sunnah prayers of Dhuhr , Maghrib and `Isha’ need not be offered (by the traveller), but he may offer other supererogatory prayers apart from that, such as the Sunnah of Fajr, the Sunnah of Witr, Qiyam Al-layl, Duha and Tahiyyat Al-masjid (two Rak`ahs to greet the mosque), and supererogatory prayers in general.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, 15/258) 
Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) criticised those who prayed regular Sunnah prayers when travelling. 
Al-Bukhari (1102) and Muslim (689) narrated that Hafs ibn `Asim ibn `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Ibn `Umar set out in the morning on the way to Makkah, and led us in praying Dhuhr, two Rak`ahs. Then he moved away and we moved away with him until he came to his mount. He sat down and we sat with him. Then he turned back and saw some people standing and said: “What are these people doing?” I said: “They are praying supererogatory.” He said: “If I had wanted to pray supererogatory, I would have offered the prayer in full. O son of my brother, I accompanied the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on a journey and he did not do more than two Rak`ahs (when travelling) until Allah took him (in death). And I accompanied Abu Bakr and he did not do more than two Rak`ahs (when travelling) until Allah took him (in death). And I accompanied `Umar and he did not do more than two Rak`ahs (when travelling) until Allah took him (in death). Then I accompanied `Uthman and he did not do more than two Rak`ahs (when travelling) until Allah took him (in death). And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

48998,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/48998,Forbidden Prayer Times,Can you please tell me about the forbidden times of prayers in a day?,Forbidden prayer times are: 1- From dawn until the sun has risen to the height of a spear; 2- When it is directly overhead at noon until it has passed its zenith; and 3- From ‘Asr prayer until the sun has set completely.,,"Praise be to Allah.There are times when it is forbidden to pray. They are as follows: 

From dawn until sunrise
From sunrise until the sun has risen to the height of a spear above the horizon; nowadays this is regarded as equivalent to twelve minutes after sunrise, but to be on the safe side one should make it a quarter of an hour.
When the sun is overhead at noon, until it has passed its zenith
From ‘Asr prayer until sunset
When the sun starts to set until it is completely set 

These times may be summed up more briefly as follows: 

From dawn until the sun has risen to the height of a spear
When it is directly overhead at noon until it has passed its zenith
From ‘Asr prayer until the sun has set completely. 

When we say from dawn, we mean that one should not offer voluntary prayers after the adhan of Fajr except the Sunnah of Fajr . This is the view of the Hanbalis. The Shafi’is are of the view that the prohibition has to do with Fajr prayer itself, so it is not forbidden to offer voluntary prayers between the adhan and iqamah , rather it is forbidden to offer voluntary prayers after offering the obligatory prayer of Fajr. 
This is the more correct view, but one should not offer any voluntary prayer after dawn apart from the two Sunnah rak’ahs of Fajr. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) only prayed two brief rak’ahs after dawn had broken.  (See al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 4/160) 
This is indicated by the report narrated by al-Bukhari (547) and Muslim (1367) from Ibn ‘Abbas, who said:  Some trustworthy men bore witness in my presence, the most trustworthy of whom in my view was ‘Umar, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade praying after Fajr until the sun had risen and after ‘Asr until the sun had set.” 
Al-Bukhari (548) and Muslim (1371) narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When the top edge of the sun has risen, then delay praying until it has risen above the horizon, and when the lower part of the sun has set, delay praying until it is fully set.” 
Al-Bukhari (551) narrated that Abu Sa’id al-Khudri said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “There is no prayer after Fajr until the sun has risen fully, and no prayer after ‘Asr until the sun has set.” 
Muslim (1373) narrated that ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir al-Juhani said: “There are three times at which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade us to pray or to bury our dead: when the sun has clearly started to rise until it is fully risen, when it is directly overhead at midday until it has passed its zenith, and when the sun starts to set until it has fully set.”

48999,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/48999,Is I’tikaf Compulsory?,What is the ruling on i’tikaf?,"I’tikaf is Sunnah, not compulsory, unless one made a vow to do it, in which case it becomes obligatory. For more, please see the detailed answer.","I’tikaf in the Quran 


I’tikaf in the Sunnah


I’tikaf according to scholarly consensus 


Is I’tikaf Compulsory?","Praise be to Allah.I’tikaf in the Quran 
I’tikaf is prescribed according to the Quran and Sunnah and scholarly consensus. 
In the Quran, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and We commanded Ibrahim (Abraham) and Isma’il (Ishmael) that they should purify My House (the Ka‘bah at Makkah) for those who are circumambulating it, or staying (I’tikaf), or bowing or prostrating themselves (there, in prayer).” [al-Baqarah 2:125] 
“And do not have sexual relations with them (your wives) while you are in I‘tikaf (i.e. confining oneself in a mosque for prayers and invocations leaving the worldly activities) in the mosques.” [al-Baqarah 2:187]
I’tikaf in the Sunnah
With regard to the Sunnah, there are many ahadith, such as the hadith of ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to observe i'tikaf during the last ten days of Ramadan until Allah took his soul, then his wives observed i'tikaf after he was gone. Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2026; Muslim, 1172. 
I’tikaf according to scholarly consensus 
With regard to scholarly consensus, more than one of the scholars narrated that there was scholarly consensus that i’tikaf is prescribed in shari’ah, such as al-Nawawi, Ibn Qudamah, Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, and others. (See al-Majmu’, 6/404; al-Mughni, 4/456; Sharh al-‘Umdah, 2/711) 
Shaykh Ibn Baz said in Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 15/437: 
“Undoubtedly i'tikaf in the mosque is an act of worship, and (observing it) in Ramadan is better than at other times. It is prescribed in Ramadan and at other times.”
Is I’tikaf Compulsory?
The basic principle is that i’tikaf is Sunnah, not obligatory, unless one made a vow to do it, in which case it becomes obligatory. This is because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever vows to obey Allah, let him obey Him, and whoever vows to disobey Him, let him not disobey Him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6696.)  
And ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “O Messenger of Allah, during the Jahiliyyah I vowed to observe i’tikaf for one night in al-Masjid al-Haram.” He said: “Fulfill your vow.” (6697) 
Ibn al-Mundhir said in his book al-Ijma' (p. 53): 
“They unanimously agreed that i’tikaf is Sunnah and is not obligatory unless a man obliges himself to do that by making a vow, in which case it becomes obligatory for him.” (See Fiqh al-I’tikaf by Dr Khalid al-Mushayqih, p. 31)
