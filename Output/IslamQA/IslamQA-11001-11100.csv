11010,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11010,Ruling on using the words “if” or “if only”?,"A man said, “If only you had done such and such, none of this would have happened to you.” Another man who heard him said, “This word (if only) was forbidden by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), it is a word that leads the one who says it to kufr.” A third man said, “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, concerning the story of Moosa with al-Khidr, ‘May Allaah have mercy upon Moosa. If only he had had patience, so that Allaah would have told us more of what happened between them.’” Another man referred to the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “ The strong believer is more beloved to Allaah than the weak believer…‘If only” opens the door to the Shaytaan.” Does this abrogate that, or not?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Everything that Allaah and His Messenger said is truth. The word ‘if’ or ‘if only’ is used in two ways: 
1.To express grief for the past and distress what has been decreed. This is what is not allowed, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O you who believe! Be not like those who disbelieve (hypocrites) and who say to their brethren when they travel through the earth or go out to fight: ‘If they had stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed,’ so that Allaah may make it a cause of regret in their hearts”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:156]
This is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade when he said, “If anything happens to you, do not say, ‘If only I had done such and such, then such and such would have happened.’ Say instead, ‘Qaddar Allaah wa maa sha’a fa 'ala (Allaah decreed and what He wills He does), for ‘If only’ opens the door to the Shaytaan”, i.e., it makes you vulnerable to grief and fear, which is harmful to you and is of no benefit. Know that whatever befalls you, you could not have avoided, and whatever does not happen to you, you could not have made it happen to you, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“No calamity befalls, but by the Leave [i.e. Decision and Qadar (Divine Preordainments)] of Allaah, and whosoever believes in Allaah, He guides his heart” [al-Taghaabun 64:11]
They said, this is a man to whom calamity happens, but he knows that it is from Allaah, so he accepts it and submits. 
2.When the word ‘if’ is used to convey beneficial knowledge, such as the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“Had there been therein (in the heavens and the earth) aalihah (gods) besides Allaah, then verily, both would have been ruined” [al-Anbiyaa’ 21:22]
The second type is used to express love for goodness, such as saying, “If only I had what so and so has, I would do what he does.” Saying things like this is permissible.
The hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “If only he [Moosa] had had patience, so that Allaah would have told us more of what happened between them” is of this nature, as is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“They wish that you should compromise (in religion out of courtesy) with them, so they (too) would compromise with you”
[al-Qalam 68:9]
Our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wished that Allaah has told us more of their [Moosa and al-Khidr] story, and he mentioned that in order to point out his love for patience and the results that come from it, and the benefits that it can bring. There was no element of fear, grief or neglect of the duty of patience in the face of what has been decreed.

11014,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11014,Is it true that women’s ‘awrah in front of other women is from the navel to the knees?,"We have heard that the ‘awrah of a woman in front of other women is from the navel to the knees. Is this correct? Especially since in banquet halls we see women who come – may Allah keep us safe and sound – wearing short or see-through clothes, or garments with cut-away designs which show her calves, or they wear light and filmy garments, or things that leave a part of the chest or back uncovered… So Muslim women come out and they look like dancers in the kaafir countries or improperly-dressed actresses on the screen. If we tell them not to do that, they say, There is nothing wrong with that; women’s ‘awrah is from the navel to the knee. Modesty has disappeared and women are becoming argumentative and imitating the kuffaar, and the problem has reached overwhelming proportions. Please advise us, may Allah reward you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.All of a woman is ‘awrah in front of non-mahram men, and it is not permissible for her to appear before men even if she is covered, if there is there is the fear of fitnah (temptation) because of looking at her and seeing how tall she is and how she walks. Concerning what was said about a woman’s ‘awrah in front of other women being from the navel to the knee, this applies only when she is in her house among her sisters and the women of her household. The basic principle is still that she should cover all of her body lest she be taken as an example and this evil practice become widespread among women. Similarly, she must also cover her charms in front of her mahrams and strange women lest some of her mahrams be tempted by her or lest some of the women describe her to others. It was reported in the hadeeth that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No woman should describe another woman to her husband so that it is as if he can see her.” What this means is that if her charms, such as her chest, her shoulders, her stomach, her back, her arms, her neck and her calves, become visible, whoever sees that will inevitably have an impression of her, and usually women talk about what they have seen to their families, male and female alike. So a woman may mention that in front of non-mahram men [i.e., men who are not mahrams of the woman being described] in a manner that may provoke them to pursue her, or which may cause bad people to form an attachment to her. For this reason, women have to cover their charms – such as their chests, backs, arms, calves, etc., - even in front of mahrams and other women. This covering becomes even more essential in parties, leisure facilities, hospitals and schools, even if there are only women present, because some non-mahram men and adolescent boys may see them or take pictures of them naked which will be a cause of temptation to those who see them. A stern warning has been issued to those who make a wanton display of themselves and wear see-through or tight clothing, when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“There are two kinds of the people of Hell … women who are clothed yet naked, walking with an enticing gait with something on their heads looking like the humps of camels, leaning to one side. They will not enter Paradise or even smell its fragrance.” What this means is that they are wearing see-through or tight clothes which show the size of their frame, or there are openings cut in the fabric which show their chests, breasts and other charms. This is widespread in parties and in general gatherings.

How is Allah close to us?","Praise be to Allah.Is Allah above the Throne?
It is proven in the Quran and Sunnah (prophetic teachings) and by the consensus of the Salaf (early generations) of this Ummah (global Islamic nation) that Allah is above His heavens over His Throne (as befits His Majesty), and that He is the Exalted, Most High. He is above all things, and there is nothing that is above Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
{Allah, it is He Who has created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them in six days. Then He rose over (istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). You (mankind) have none, besides Him, as a Wali (protector or helper) or an intercessor. Will you not then remember (or receive admonition)?} [As-Sajdah 32:4]  
{Surely, your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then rose over (istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty), disposing the affair of all things.} [Yunus 10:3]
 {To Him ascend (all) the goodly words, and the righteous deeds exalt it (i.e. the goodly words are not accepted by Allah unless and until they are followed by good deeds).} [Fatir 35:10]
 “He is the First (nothing is before Him) and the Last (nothing is after Him), the Most High (nothing is above Him) and the Most Near (nothing is nearer than Him).} [Al-Hadid 57:3]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “You are the Most High and there is nothing above You…”
There are many similar verses and prophetic narrations. But at the same time, Allah tells us that He is with His slaves wherever they are:
{Have you not seen that Allah knows whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth? There is no najwa (secret counsel) of three but He is their fourth (with His Knowledge, while He Himself is over the Throne, over the seventh heaven), — nor of five but He is their sixth (with His Knowledge), — nor of less than that or more but He is with them (with His Knowledge) wheresoever they may be.} [Al-Mujadalah 58:7]
Allah has combined mention of His being above His Throne with mention of His being with His slaves in one ayah (verse), where He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
{He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then rose over (istawa) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty) . He knows what goes into the earth and what comes forth from it, and what descends from the heaven and what ascends thereto. And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be.} [Al-Hadid 57:4]  
How is Allah close to us?
Saying that Allah is with us does not mean that He is mixed with (or dwells in) His creation; rather He is with His slaves by His knowledge. He is above His Throne and nothing is hidden from Him of what they do. With regard to the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
{And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein (by Our Knowledge).} [Qaf 50:16] 
Most of the exegetists said that what is meant is that He is near by means of His angels whose task it is to record people’s deeds. And those who said that it means that He is near explained it as meaning that He is near by His knowledge, as is said concerning how He is with us.
This is the view of Ahl As-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (followers of prophetic guidance), who affirm that Allah is above His creation and that He is also with His slaves, and they state that He is far above dwelling in His created beings. 
With regard to the denial of all Divine attributes as voiced by the Jahmiyyah (a deviant sect) and their followers, they deny that His Essence is above His creatures and that He rose above His Throne, and they say that He is present in His Essence everywhere. We ask Allah to guide the Muslims.

The amount of this fruit may reach or exceed the nisaab (the set minimum at which payment of zakaah becomes obligatory). Is it obligatory to pay zakaah on this? If a person gives some away as gifts or eats some, does this cancel out the obligation of zakaah or not? What is the amount of zakaah if it is obligatory? What is the amount of the nisaab? If seedlings from the tree are sold, is there any zakaah on that? If the tree was planted for the purpose of selling seedlings from it, is there any zakaah on it? May Allaah reward you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.In the case of palm trees growing in people’s houses (gardens), zakaah is due on their fruits if it reaches the nisaab, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O you who believe! Spend of the good things which you have (legally) earned, and of that which We have produced from the earth for you” [al-Baqarah 2:267]. This is one of the things that Allaah produces from the earth for us, so zakaah is obligatory on it whether it is given as gifts, eaten or sold.
If it does not reach the amount of the nisaab, there is no zakaah due on it, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No sadaqah (i.e., zakaah) is due on anything less than five wasq of dates.” A wasq is sixty saa’ of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the saa’ of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is equivalent to 2.4 kilograms. So the nisaab is 612 kilograms. The standard in this case is the weight of good quality wheat; 2.4 kilograms of good quality wheat should be put in a vessel, and the goods to be assessed should be of the same volume as this, no more and no less. This is the saa’ of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): to measure goods other than wheat by volume.
It is well known that things to be measured by volume may vary in weight; if it is heavy then the zakaah should be increased accordingly.
The rate of zakaah is one-half of one-tenth [i.e., one twentieth, 1/20] because it is irrigated with water which is brought from wells or the sea, but there is effort and cost involved in pumping or desalinating the water. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “For things which are watered by rain or springs, the zakaah is one-tenth; for things which are watered by bringing water to them, the rate is half of one-tenth.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari).
There is no zakaah on the seedlings, but if they are sold for cash and the money is kept for an entire (hijri) year, then zakaah becomes due on it.
There is no zakaah on the palm-tree which is planted for the purpose of obtaining seedlings, just as there is no zakaah on the palm-tree which is planted for the purpose of selling its fruits. Whatever fruit of domestic palm trees is sold, zakaah should be paid on its value. Whatever dates are eaten fresh, zakaah should be paid in fresh dates of intermediate quality, if they are plentiful, and whatever dates are kept and dried, their zakaah should be paid in dried dates.

          And because fitnah may arise by looking at all of that. The hadeeth 
          that says that it is permissible to uncover the face and hands is not 
          saheeh. 
 With 
          regard to a woman’s ‘awrah in front of her brothers, father, uncles 
          etc., and other women, it is everything apart from that which ordinarily 
          appears of her. So it is permissible for her to show her head, face, 
          hands, neck and feet, because it is too difficult for her to cover them 
          in front of them, and because there is no fear of fitnah in this case. 
          
 Shaykh 
          Waleed al-Firyaan. 
 Ibn 
          Katheer said in his Tafseer 
          of the aayah (interpretation of the meaning) 
“…and 
          to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, 
          necks and bosoms)…” [al-Noor24:31]: 
          
 “’…and 
          to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, 
          necks and bosoms)…’ means that they should wear the outer 
          garment in such a way as to cover their chests and ribs, so that they 
          will be different from the women of the jaahiliyyah, 
          who did not do that but would pass in front of men with their chests 
          completely uncovered, and with their necks, forelocks, hair and earrings 
          uncovered. So Allaah commanded the believing women to cover themselves, 
          as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘O Prophet! Tell your 
          wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their 
          cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely 
          except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that 
          they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed’ 
          [al-Ahzaab 33:59] 
And concerning this aayah (interpretation of the meaning) – 
‘… and to draw their 
          veils all over juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)’ 
          – he said: khumur (veils) 
          is the plural of khimaar, 
          which means something that covers, and is what is used to cover the 
          head. This is what is known among the people as a veil. 
Sa’eed ibn Jubayr said: ‘and 
          to draw’ means to pull it around and tie it securely. 
‘their veils all over 
          juyoobihinna’ means, over their necks and 
          chests so that nothing can be seen of them. 
Al-Bukhaari (4758) said: Ubayy told us from 
          Yoonus from Ibn Shihaab from ‘Urwah that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased 
          with her) said: 
‘May Allaah have mercy on the early Muhaajir 
          women. When Allaah revealed the aayah 
          (interpretation of the meaning) – 
“… and to draw their 
          veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)…”, 
          they tore their aprons and covered themselves with them.’ 
Al-Bukhaari also said (4759): Abu Na’eem told us, Ibraaheem 
          ibn Naafi’ told us, from al-Hasan ibn Muslim, from Safiyyah bint Shaybah 
          that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) used to say: when this 
          aayah (interpretation 
          of the meaning) – 
‘…and 
          to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, 
          necks and bosoms)…’ – was revealed, they took their izaars 
          (waistsheets) and tore them at the edges, and covered themselves with 
          them.
Ibn Abi Haatim said: 
          my father told us, Ahmad ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Yoonus told us, al-Zanji 
          ibn Khaalid told me, ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Uthmaan ibn Khaytham told us, 
          that Safiyah bint Shaybah said: whilst we were sitting with ‘Aa’ishah, 
          mention was made of the women of Quraysh and how good they were. ‘Aa’ishah 
          said that the women of Quraysh were indeed good, ‘but by Allaah I have 
          never seen any better than the women of the Ansaar, or any women who 
          believed more strongly in the Book of Allaah and had more faith in the 
          Revelation. When Soorat al-Noor was revealed –
“…and 
          to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, 
          necks and bosoms)…” [al-Noor24:31] 
          – 
their menfolk came back to them and recited to them 
          what Allaah had revealed. No sooner had a man recited it to his wife, 
          daughter, sister and all other female relatives, but they all went and 
          picked up their embroidered aprons, and covered their heads with them, 
          in obedience to the words of His Book that Allaah had revealed. The 
          next morning they stood behind the Messenger of Allaah  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with their heads covered, 
          as if there were crows on their heads.’
(Narrated by Abu Dawood, 
          4100 with more than one isnaadfrom Safiyyah 
          bint Shaybah).Ibn 
          Jareer said (18120): Yoonus told us, Ibn Wahb informed us that Qarqarah 
          ibn ‘Abd al-Rahmaan told him from Ibn Shihaab from ‘Urwah that ‘Aa’ishah 
          said: 
‘May Allaah have mercy 
          on the first muhaajir women. When Allaah revealed the words (interpretation 
          of the meaning) – 
“…and 
          to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, 
          necks and bosoms)…” [al-Noor24:31] 
          – 
they tore the edges 
          of their aprons and covered their heads with them.’

 What 
          you have mentioned about some books saying that women have to wear hijaab 
          in front of their brothers and fathers is extreme and is a mistake.

 “And 
          tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden 
          things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) 
          and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent 
          (like both eyes for necessity to see the way, or outer palms of hands 
          or one eye or dress like veil, gloves, headcover, apron), 
          and to draw their veils all over 
          Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms) and not to 
          reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or 
          their husband’s fathers, or their sons, or their husband’s sons, or 
          their brothers or their brother’s sons, or their sister’s sons, or their 
          (Muslim) women (i.e. their sisters in Islam), or the (female) slaves 
          whom their right hands possess, or old male servants who lack vigour, 
          or small children who have no sense of feminine sex. And let them not 
          stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment. 
          And all of you beg Allaah to forgive you all, O believers, that you 
          may be successful” [al-Noor

Shaykh 
          Sa’d al-Humayd 
There 
          follows the story of Haajar and Zamzam from the Sunnah, so that you 
          will have no need of the Bible, of which we cannot be sure that the 
          content is correct. 
Ibn 
          ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated the story of Haajar, 
          the wife of Ibraaheem and the mother of his son Ismaa’eel. He said: 
Ibraaheem brought her and her son Ismaa’eel while 
          she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka'bah under a tree on the 
          spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days 
          there was nobody in Makkah, nor was there any water. So he made them 
          sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, 
          and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. 
          Ismaa’eel's mother followed him saying, ""O Ibraaheem! Where are 
          you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose 
          company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?"" She repeated 
          that to him many times, but he did not look back at her. Then she asked 
          him, ""Has Allah ordered you to do this?"" He said, ""Yes."" 
          She said, ""Then He will not neglect us,"" and returned while 
          Ibraaheem went on his way. When he reached al-Thaniyyah, where they 
          could not see him, he faced the Ka'bah, and raising both hands, prayed 
          to Allaah in the following words:
“O 
          our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in an uncultivable 
          valley by Your Sacred House (the Ka‘bah at Makkah) in order, O our Lord, 
          that they may perform As‑Salaah (Iqaamat‑as‑Salaah). 
          So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allaah) 
          provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks”[Ibraaheem 14:37 
          – interpretation of the meaning] 
Ismaa’eel's mother went on suckling Ismaa’eel and 
          drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin 
          had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. 
          She started looking at him (i.e. Ismaa’eel) tossing in agony (or he 
          said: kicking with his heels). She left him, for she could not endure 
          looking at him, and found that the mountain of al-Safa was the nearest 
          mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at 
          the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not 
          see anybody. Then she descended from al-Safa and when she reached the 
          valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in 
          distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached al-Marwa 
          where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but 
          she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between al-Safa 
          and al-Marwa) seven times.
Ibn ‘Abbaas said: the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ""This is the 
          source of the tradition of the walking between them (i.e. al-Safa and 
          al-Marwa). When she reached al-Marwa (for the last time) she heard a 
          voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She 
          heard the voice again and said, “O (whoever you may be)! You have made 
          me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?"" And she 
          saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel 
          (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make 
          something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started 
          filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water started 
          flowing out after she had scooped some of it.""
Ibn 
          ‘Abbaas said: The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added, ""May Allah bestow Mercy on Ismaa’eel's 
          mother! Had she left the Zamzam alone (flowing without trying to control 
          it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), 
          Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth."" 
          The Prophet further added, ""Then she drank (water) and suckled 
          her child. The angel said to her, 'Don't be afraid of being neglected, 
          for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his 
          father, and Allah never neglects His people.' The House (i.e. Ka’bah) 
          at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents 
          came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till 
          some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed 
          by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through 
          the way of Kada'. They landed in the lower part of Makkah where they 
          saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving 
          it. They said, ‘This bird must be flying around water, though we know 
          that there is no water in this valley.’ They sent one or two messengers 
          who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the 
          water. So, they all came (towards the water).""
The 
          Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added, 
          ""Ismaa’eel's mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, 
          'Do you allow us to stay with you?' She replied, 'Yes, but you will 
          have no right to possess the water.' They agreed to that."" Ibn 
          ‘Abbaas said: the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) further said, ""Ismaa’eel's mother was pleased with 
          the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the 
          people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families 
          who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent 
          residents there. The child (i.e. Ismaa’eel) grew up and learnt Arabic 
          from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he 
          grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry 
          a woman from amongst them.  
After Ismaa’eel's mother had died, Ibraaheem 
          came after Ismaa’eel's marriage in order to see his family that he had 
          left before…
Then 
          Ibraaheem came back later on. He saw Ismaa’eel under a tree near Zam-zam, 
          sharpening his arrows. When he saw Ibraaheem, he stood up to welcome 
          him, and they greeted each other as a father does with his son and a 
          son does with his father. Ibraaheem said, 'O Ismaa’eel! Allah has given 
          me an order.' Ismaa’eel said, 'Do what your Lord has ordered you to 
          do.' Ibraaheem asked, 'Will you help me?' Ismaa’eel said, 'I will help 
          you.' Ibraaheem said, ‘Allah has ordered me to build a house here,' 
          pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it."" The 
          Prophet added, ""Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. 
          the Ka'bah). Ismaa’eel brought the stones and Ibraaheem was building, 
          and when the walls became high, Ismaa’eel brought this stone and put 
          it for Ibraaheem who stood on it and carried on building, while Ismaa’eel 
          was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, ‘Our

          the All-Knower' [al-Baqarah 2:127 – interpretation of the meaning]. 
          The Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) added, ""Then both of them went on building 
          and going round the Ka'ba saying: ‘Our

In general, I would say that everything that is only for men is not permissible for women to wear, and everything that is only for women is not permissible for men to wear. 
But if it is a garment that is common to both sexes, there is nothing wrong with that, or if a woman is forced by necessity, such as in some Muslim countries where there is extreme poverty – if a woman finds a garment that is not see-through and does not show the shape of her body, and covers her properly, and it is regarded as a man's garment in some Muslim countries, there is nothing wrong with her wearing it because of necessity and the need to cover the ‘awrah, because this is a case of necessity, not ordinary circumstances.","From the fatwas of Shaykh Ibraaheem al-Khudayri for al-Da’wah magazine, issue no. 1762, p. 37"

4. is it not bid'ah if some say that they are fasting it as a nafil fasting on the day of shab'e barat?
some muslim brothers say that the extra prayers we pray after 8 rakat in tarawih and the fasting on various days such as shabe barat and mi'raj and meelad un nabi are not bid'ah, because these form of worship is taught to us by prophet and what is wrong in praying or fasting on any day (other than forbidden days and times).what is the ruling?
5.praying salat tasbih nafil? (100 times surat al ikhlas in every rakat)","Fasting on the day of al-Isra and al-Mi`raj or the day of Shab-e-Barat is not permissible and comes under the heading of bid`ah. If these days coincide with Mondays  or Thursdays, there is nothing wrong with fasting them with the intention of fasting on Monday or Thursday.","Can you pray more than 8 rak’ahs in Tarawih?


Is fasting on the day of al-Isra and al-Mi`raj permissible?


Is fasting the day of Shab-e-Barat allowed?


Is Salat al-Tasbih sunnah?","Praise be to Allah.Can you pray more than 8 rak’ahs in Tarawih?
Praying more than 8 rak`ahs in Tarawih is not considered bid`ah, on the condition that one does not single out certain nights for increasing the number, such as the last ten nights . The number of raka`hs during the last ten nights should be the same as the number during the other nights. The last ten nights should be characterized by making the rak`ahs longer. 
Is fasting on the day of al-Isra and al-Mi`raj permissible?
Fasting on the day which one believes to be the day of the Mi`raj is not permissible, and comes under the heading of bid`ah. Even if a person is not sure, but he fasts this day for the sake of being on the safe side, it is as if he is saying, ‘If it is really the day of the Mi`raj, then I will have fasted it, and if it is not, it will still be a good action that I have done, and if I will not be rewarded for it then I will not be punished.’ 
This attitude means that a person is committing bid`ah, and he is a sinner who deserves to be punished. But if his fast is not because it is the day of the Mi`raj, but is rather because it is his habit to fast alternate days, or to fast Mondays and Thursdays, and that happens to coincide with the day known as the day of the Mi`raj, there is nothing wrong with him fasting it with that intention, i.e., the intention of fasting on Monday or Thursday, or a day on which he usually fasts. 
Is fasting the day of Shab-e-Barat allowed?
What we have said about fasting on the day of the Mi`raj also applies to fasting on the day of Shab-e-Barat . If any Muslim says that fasting on the day of the Mi`raj or on the day of Shab-e-Barat is not bid`ah because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us these acts of worship, so what is wrong with fasting any day apart from the days on which it is haram to fast? Our response to that is:
If the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us these acts of worship, then where is the evidence for singling out the day of the Mi`raj or any other day for fasting? 
If there was any evidence that it is prescribed to fast on these two days, no one would be able to say that fasting on these days is bid`ah. But what is apparent is that those who say this mean that fasting is an act of worship in general terms, so that if he fasts he has done an act of worship for which he will be rewarded, so long as it is not on one of the days when fasting is not allowed, such as on ‘Eid. This would be correct if the person who is fasting did not single out a day which he believes is a day of virtue, such as the day of the Mi`raj or the day of Shab-e-Barat. What makes this the matter of bid’ah is the fact that one is singling out these days. If there was any virtue in fasting these two days, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have fasted them, and he would have urged us to fast them. It is known that the Companions of the Messenger of Allah were more keen to do good than we are; if they had known that there was any virtue in fasting these two days, they would have fasted them. Since we find no reports to that effect from them, we know that this is an innovated bid’ah, and the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does an action that is not a part of this matter of ours (Islam) will have it rejected,” i.e., it will be thrown back on the one who does it. Fasting these two days is an action which we find no report of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoining, so it is to be rejected. 
Is Salat al-Tasbih sunnah?
The “salat tasbih nafilah” is to be regarded in the same way as the matter discussed above, in the fullest sense. Acts of worship that have no evidence to support them are to be rejected. Salat al-Tasbih has not been proven in the Book of Allah or in the Sunnah of His Chosen Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that there is any prayer in which “Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad” is to be recited 100 times, so doing that is an innovated bid`ah for which the one who does it will be punished.

11093,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11093,What to do at times of fitnah and division,"Are these the times which are referred to in the hadeeth of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), according to which when one of the Sahaabah asked him, “What should I do when there is too much fitnah and division?”, he replied, “Keep away from the people, and sit in your house”? In al-Saheeh, in Kitaab al-Fitan, Baab Kayf al-Haal idha lam yakun khaleefah, there is a hadeeth which says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told them to withdraw from people when calamities strike, and he said, “… even if you have to bite onto the root of a tree.” Please explain this hadeeth and tell us what the scholars said about it.",,,"Praise be to Allah.In al-Saheehayn 
          and elsewhere – and this version was narrated by al-Bukhaari – it is 
          reported from Abu Idrees al-Khawlaani that he heard Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan 
          say: “The people used to ask the Messenger of Allaah  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about good things, but I 
          used to ask him about bad things, fearing that I would live to see such 
          things. I said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, we were in a state of ignorance 
          (jaahiliyyah) and evil, then Allaah sent us this good (i.e., Islam). 
          Will there be any evil after this good?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ I said, ‘Will 
          there by any good after that evil?’ He said, ‘Yes, but it will be tainted.’ 
          I said, ‘How will it be tainted?’ He said, ‘(There will be) some people 
          who will guide others in a way that is not according to my guidance. 
          You will approve of some of their deeds and disapprove of others.’ I 
          said, ‘Will there be any evil after that good?’ He said, ‘Yes, there 
          will be people calling at the gates of Hell, and whoever responds to 
          their call, they will throw them into it (the Fire).’ I said, ‘O Messenger 
          of Allaah, describe them to us.’ He said, ‘They will be from among our 
          people, speaking our language.’ I said, ‘What do you command me to do 
          if I live to see such a thing?’ He said, ‘Adhere to the jamaa’ah (group, 
          community) of the Muslims and their imaam (leader).’ I asked, ‘What 
          if there is no jamaa’ah and no leader?’ He said, ‘Then keep away from 
          all those groups, even if you have to bite (eat) the roots of a tree 
          until death overtakes you whilst you are in that state.’”  
        The time does not refer to this particular period we are living in; 
          it is a general idea which may refer to any time and place, from the 
          time of the fitnah and rebellion against ‘Uthmaan (may Allaah be pleased 
          with him) at the time of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them 
          all), onwards. 
What is meant by keeping away or withdrawing from people at the time 
          of division is what was mentioned by al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may Allaah 
          have mercy on him) in al-Fath, 
          narrating from al-Tabari, who said: when the people do not have an imaam 
          (leader) and they split into sects and parties, do not follow any of 
          these groups; keep away from all of them if possible, lest one fall 
          into evil. When there is a jamaa’ah that is truly following the Straight 
          Path, then you have to join them and help to increase their numbers, 
          and cooperate with them in truth, because in that case this group constitutes 
          the jamaa’ah of the Muslims for that man in that place. 
And Allaah is the source of strength. May Allaah bless our Prophet 
          Muhammad and his family and companions and grant them them peace.","Fataawa  al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 3/95"
11095,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11095,"A Muslim man has proposed marriage to her, and she committed a sin previously","I am a 25 year old woman, who has had a Muta'a marriage at a young age.  I understand that the Sunnis believe that this type of marriage is haraam.  The reasons why I had that marriage are too many to explain here, but the circumstances under which it happenned make me still question how great a sin it was, and sometimes if it is a sin at all.  May Allah forgive me, and show me the right way, as living in the world so different from the days of the Prophet makes it sometimes difficult for me, as both a Westerner as well as Muslim, to distinguish between the haraam and the halaal.

I now know a Muslim man who has never been married, and who would like to marry me.  I am concerned that this is not in his best interest, but I am not absolutely sure about this.  For one, our values are presently very similar, and we have much in common.  In fact, I have never known anyone so similar to me.  However, his life has been somewhat different from mine, and Allah has mercifully protected him from some choices I had to make.  What I want more than spending my life with this man is for him to be at ease with his decision to marry me, and to feel that it is religiously correct or permissible for him to do so.  Is that possible?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If the man 
    who has proposed marriage is compatible – i.e., his religious commitment is 
    good and he is trustworthy, it is not permissible for you to hesitate to 
    accept him. The doubts and objections that are not based on any evidence do 
    not mean anything, so do not worry about them. If he is as you have 
    described, then do not hesitate to accept. With regard to the previous 
    mut’ah marriage, there is no doubt that mut’ah is haraam; it has been 
    abrogated and it is not permissible to get married in this way. But if you 
    knew that at the time, then you have to repent and ask for forgiveness.",Shaykh ‘Abd al-Kareem al-Khudayr
