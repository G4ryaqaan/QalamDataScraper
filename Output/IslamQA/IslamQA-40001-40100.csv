40005,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40005,Ruling on upholding ties with one’s mother and siblings through breastfeeding,"I have a mother and siblings through breastfeeding (radaa’ah). Do I have to uphold ties with them and visit them as I visit my mother and siblings through blood ties? I used to visit them, then it was said to me that I do not have to do that, and I am confused about that.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The shar’i rulings concerning relationships through breastfeeding are not the same as the rulings concerning relationships through blood ties. Breastfeeding (radaa’ah) does not mean that one is obliged to spend on those relatives, or that one is entitled to inherit from them, or that one may be a guardian for the purpose of marriage – unlike the case with ties of blood. 
What they have in common is that people related in either way are forbidden to marry, and may look at one another and be alone with one another, and are regarded as mahrams for the purpose of travel. 
This is the wisdom of sharee’ah, because Islam cannot give a mother who breastfed a child five times the same rights as the mother who carried him, gave birth to him, breastfed him and brought him up, and is the reason for the child’s existence. Can the love, compassion and devotion in the heart of the blood mother be likened to that in the heart of the mother through breastfeeding? 
There are verses of the Qur’aan which refer to that. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years”
[Luqmaan 31:14]
And Allaah says, after commanding the child to treat his parents well and forbidding him to do the slightest act of disobedience towards them (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and say: ‘My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was young’”
[al-Isra’ 17:24]
Hence some of the scholars said that a son through breastfeeding has to respect and honour his mother and his parents through breastfeeding, but he does not have to honour them and uphold ties with them in the same way as a son is obliged to honour his parents and relatives by blood. 
There are several da’eef (weak) ahaadeeth on this topic, which we will mention here so that people may be aware of them. 
1 – It was narrated that al-Tufayl (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sharing out some meat in al-Ji’raanah, when a woman came up to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he spread out her cloak for her, and she sat down on it. I said, “Who is she?” They said, “This is his mother who breastfed him.” 
Narrated by Abu Dawood, 5144; classed as da’eef by al-Albaani in Da’eef Abi Dawood, 1102. 
Ibn Hibbaan (10/44) included this hadeeth in a chapter which he called, “Ways in which it is recommended for a person to honour the one who breastfed him when he was small.” 
2 – It was narrated from ‘Umar ibn al-Saa’ib that he heard that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was sitting when his father through breastfeeding came to him; he spread part of his cloak for him and he sat on it. Then his mother through breastfeeding came to him and he spread part of his cloak on the other side and she sat on it. Then his brother through breastfeeding came and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood up for him and made him sit in front of him. 
Narrated by Abu Dawood, 5145; classed as da’eef by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah, 1120. 
3 – It was narrated from Hajjaaj ibn Hajjaaj al-Aslami that his father asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “O Messenger of Allaah, how can I repay the favour of breastfeeding?” He said: “(By giving) a male or female slave.” 
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1153; al-Nasaa’i, 3329; Abu Dawood, 2064. Classed as da’eef by al-Albaani in Da’eef Abi Dawood, 445. 
Al-Suyooti said in Sharh al-Nasaa’i, 6/108. 
What is meant by repaying the favour of breastfeeding is the duties that are owed as a result of having been breastfed. It is as if he is asking, How can I waive the duties I owe as a result of having been breastfed so that I will have paid them off in full? They used to regard it as something good to give a gift to the wet nurse once the child had been weaned, other the wages that had be agreed upon. End quote. 
4 – The biographers said that when the captive woman of Hawaazin had been gathered together, their spokesman Zuhayr ibn Sard came and said: “O Messenger of Allaah, inside the enclosure are your mothers, your maternal aunts and your nursemaids. Do us a favour (and free us), may Allaah bless you.”  
These ahaadeeth speak of honouring and respecting, which are Islamic manners that are encouraged with regard to all Muslims. This is the reason why the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) set them all free.

What should he do?","During some part of my life I was a sinner, and my problem is that I used to pilfer from the petty cash in the place where I was. After Allaah guided me I became aware of my sin and I started to give back the money I owed. But the problem is that I do not know exactly how much it was. I tried to get the owner of the place to forgive me without mentioning the reason but I could not do it. I do not have any other money that I could use to pay it off. Will Allaah accept my repentance if I cannot return what I owe? If there is anything that I can do, what is it?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.What you have to do is to repent to Allaah and return all the money that you took. 
    Your repentance is not complete otherwise. If you do not know the exact amount, then it is sufficient to do what you think is most likely, and be 
    on the safe side [?] when estimating how much you owe. If you are not sure whether the amount is eighty or one hundred, for example, then pay one 
    hundred, so that you will meet your Lord free from the burden of this treachery and wrongdoing. Al-Bukhaari (2449) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever has wronged his brother 
    with regard to his honour or anything else, let him settle the matter now, before there is no dinar and no dirham, and if he has any righteous 
    deeds some will be taken from him according to the wrong he did, and if he has no hasanaat (good deeds), some of the other person’s sayi’aat  (bad 
    deeds) will be taken and given to him.” 
Whatever you are unable to repay now is a debt that you owe, and you will not have 
    discharged your duty until you pay it. What you have to do in that case is to make sure that it is mentioned in your will, lest death come upon 
    you suddenly before you can pay it off. Al-Bukhaari (2738) and Muslim (1627) narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that he heard the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “No Muslim who has anything concerning which a will should be made should spend three nights 
    without making a written will.” ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar said: I never spent one night since I heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) say that but I had my will with me.

40023,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40023,Giving zakaah to a poor person so that he can go for Hajj,Is it permissible to give zakaah to a poor person so that he can perform the obligation of Hajj?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah has mentioned the things on which zakaah is to be spent in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“As-Sadaqaat (here it means Zakaah) are only for the Fuqaraa’ (poor), and Al-Masaakeen (the poor) and those employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in debt; and for Allaah’s Cause (i.e. for Mujaahidoon — those fighting in a holy battle), and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty imposed by Allaah. And Allaah is All-Knower, All-Wise”
[al-Tawbah 9:60]
The scholars are agreed that the phrase “for Allaah’s Cause” refers to jihad for the sake of Allaah. But they differed as to whether Hajj is included with jihad or not. 
The majority of scholars were of the view that it applies only to jihad and does not include Hajj. Imam Ahmad was of the view that it includes Hajj as well, and he quoted as evidence for that the report narrated by Abu Dawood (1988) from Umm Ma’qal, who said: “O Messenger of Allaah, I need to go for Hajj and Abu Ma’qal has a young camel.” Abu Ma’qal said, “She is telling the truth, and I shall donate it for the sake of Allaah.” The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Give it to her so that she may go for Hajj on it, for it is for the sake of Allaah.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
And it was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: “Hajj comes under the heading of for Allaah’s Cause.” Al-Haafiz said: Abu ‘Ubayd narrated it with a saheeh isnaad. 
See al-Mughni, 9/328; al-Majmoo’, 6/212. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in al-Ikhtiyaaraat, 105: 
Whoever has not done the obligatory Hajj and is poor should be given what he needs to do Hajj – i.e. from the zakaah funds. 
And it says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 10/38: 
It is permissible to give zakaah so that poor Muslims can travel to do the obligatory Hajj, because this comes under the general meaning of the phrase “for Allaah’s Cause” in the verse which speaks of the ways in which zakaah is to be spent.

    asked about them on the Day of Resurrection. It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar 
    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock. The

If the 
    husband calls his wife to watch these movies, it is not permissible for her 
    to obey him, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon

    obedience is only with regard to that which is right and proper.” Narrated 
    by al-Bukhaari, 7257; Muslim, 1840. 
The 
    husband’s threat of divorce does not count as a legitimate excuse for her, 
    and is not regarded as her being forced to do it. Rather she should advise 
    him in the way that is better. If he responds and gives up the evil that he 
    is doing, this is something good that he is doing for himself, and she will 
    be rewarded for that. If he refuses to respond to the command of Allaah to 
    lower the gaze and avoid looking at haraam things, then it is not 
    permissible for her to obey him in committing sin, and she should not trust

40054,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40054,Using drawings and pictures to learn medicine,"I am a medical student, and i wish to become a good doctor one day InshaAllah. Reguarding my education my problems are 

1) My books contain figures of the human body both male and female, and I do not know if Hijab permits such knowledge to be learned,

2) As a student I have to cut open dead human bodies to study the various parts of the human body. I do not know if this is haraam or halaal

3) In exams students draw pictures of specific parts in their answers (not of the whole human body). I know the hadeeth that all picture makers will be in the fire, but i donot know if it is permissable to draw pictures for educational purposes. 

Please advise me as I do not wish to go beyond the Islamic Shareeah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It is well known in our religion that the basic principle 
    with regard to drawings and pictures of animate beings is that they are 
    haraam, because of the many ahaadeeth in which it says that they are 
    forbidden and warn against them. We have previously explained that in a 
    number of questions on this site. Please see, for example, question no.
    7222. 

    It is well known in the principles of fiqh on which there is 
    consensus that in cases of necessity, forbidden things are permitted, so the 
    ruling may change from prohibition to permission if that will lead to 
    achieving one of the five necessities that Islam came to protect, which are: 
    religion, life, physical health, honour and wealth. 

    Because medicine is one of the necessary sciences that people 
    need, to such an extent that some scholars regarded it as a communal 
    obligation, this means that some things are permitted which are basically 
    forbidden, in order to fulfil this communal obligation.  

    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Rawdat 
    al-Taalibeen (1/223): 

    With regard to sciences, some of them are a communal 
    obligation, such as medicine. End quote. 

    Indeed, Muwaffaq al-Deen al-Baghdaadi narrated in his book 
    al-Tibb min al-Kitaab wa’l-Sunnah (187) that Imam al-Shaafa’i said: 

    I do not know of any branch of knowledge, after knowledge of 
    halaal and haraam, that is more noble than medicine. End quote. 

    Even if a doctor does not treat women except in cases of 
    necessity, he must learn how to treat both sexes, because a woman may not be 
    able to find a female doctor in a certain specialty or in a certain city. 
    Also, knowledge of medicine is based on understanding the makeup of the 
    human body, and the features of its various parts, and details of their 
    functions. How well the doctor understands that will determine how well he 
    knows medicine and how successful he is in ridding people of problems and 
    diseases.  

    Hence there is nothing wrong with the doctor studying 
    drawings that show the human body, whether they are of men or women, and 
    there is nothing wrong – in sha Allaah – with using drawings in exams for 
    students of medicine and life sciences, as that will help them to understand 
    properly and learn this knowledge correctly. 

    In our religion it is permissible for women to treat men in 
    cases of necessity. 

    It was narrated that al-Rubayyi’ bint Mu’awwidh (may Allaah 
    be pleased with her) said: We were with the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), bringing water, treating the wounded and 
    carrying the slain back to Madeenah. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (2882). 

    Ibn Hajar said, commenting on this hadeeth in Fath 
    al-Baari (6/52): 

    This shows that it is permissible for a non-mahram woman to 
    treat a non-mahram man in cases of necessity. End quote. 

    In our religion there is also evidence which indicates that 
    it is permissible to make pictures and images for children’s toys, because 
    children need to play and learn. See the answer to question no.
    9473. 

    In a Fatwa issued by the scholars of the Standing Committee, 
    there is evidence which indicates that it is permissible to make pictures in 
    cases of necessity, such as pictures to prove the identity of a person and 
    the like. See the answer to question no.
    34904 and
    39806. 

    As for making pictures and drawing parts of the body 
    separately, such as the head or the chest, many scholars are of the view 
    that it is permissible. See the answer to question no.
    13633. 

    All of the above indicates that it is permissible to use 
    drawing and pictures in studying medicine, etc.
