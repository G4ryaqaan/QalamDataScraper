1804,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1804,Is One’s Spouse Written in Islam?,What does Islam say about life partner? Is she/he fixed by Allah or Allah has left it for us to decide?,"Man has freedom of will through which he can choose whichever woman he wishes to marry, and that whatever choice he makes has already been decreed by Allah.",,"Praise be to Allah.First of all, we should realize that there is no contradiction between our belief that Allah has decreed everything, and our belief that He has given us free will which enables us to do things. Confirming the free will of His slaves, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""To whomsoever among you wills to walk straight"" [At-Takwir 81:28]

Our will operates within the will of Allah , not outside of it, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""But you cannot will, unless Allah wills…"" [Al-Insan 76:30] 
Thus it is not permitted to try to cancel one idea out with the other, or to deny either of them. Allah has confirmed both, that man has the power to choose, and that nothing can operate outside of His Will, may He be Glorified.

If we apply this to the question asked, we will see that man has freedom of will through which he can choose whichever woman he wishes to marry , and that whatever choice he makes has already been decreed by Allah. 
The man’s choice is the means by which he gets what he wants, but some obstacles may come between the person and what he wants, in which case he will realize that Allah has not decreed this for him, for some reason which is known to Him.
Everything that Allah does is good, and His slaves do not have knowledge of the Unseen or of how things will end. A person may regret missing out on something when it is good that he did not have it, or he may hate something that happens to him when it is good that it happened to him, as Allah tells us (interpretation of the meaning): ""… it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allah knows but you do not know."" [Al-Baqarah 2:216]

1805,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1805,"Wants to marry a
    girl but his father does not approve of her","I have chosen a religious and
      well-mannered girl to be my wife, but when I told my father about this, he rejected the
      idea. I have tried to convince him but he is insisting. I wanted to know why, but he said
      there is no reason why. I am confused. Should I obey my father and forget about the girl I
      have chosen even though this will cause me and my family so much pain? I hope that you
      will advise of the right thing to do. May Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This question requires that we offer advice to both of you. Firstly, to
    your father, who you say is preventing you from marrying this girl whom you describe as
    religious and well-mannered. He has to allow you to marry her, unless he has some
    legitimate Islamic reason, which he should explain to you to convince you and put your
    mind at rest. He should also put himself in your shoes: if his own father prevented him
    from marrying a religious and well-mannered girl whom he liked, would he not feel
    resentful about this denial of his freedom? If he would not like his father to do such a
    thing to him, how can he do this to his son? As the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) said: “None of you truly believes until he likes for his brother
    what he likes for himself.”
It is not right for your father to prevent you from marrying this girl
    with no legitimate Islamic reason. If there is a reason, he should explain it to you so
    that you will understand what is going on. 
Our advice to you is this: if you can possibly change your mind and
    find another girl to marry, in order to please your father, maintain family unity and
    avoid division, then do so.
But you may find that you cannot do that, because your heart is
    attached to this girl, and you cannot bear the thought of marrying anyone else. You may
    also be afraid that if you choose another girl, your father might object to that marriage
    too, because some parents may try to force their son to marry a relative, or a woman whose
    qualities the father likes but the son does not. Some parents may feel jealousy or envy
    even towards their own children, so they prevent them from doing what they want to do. If
    this is the case, then there is no sin on you if you marry her, even if your father
    objects. Perhaps after you are married, your father may change his mind. We ask Allaah to
    help you make the right choice.","Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, Fataawaa Islamiyyah, vol. 4, p. 193"
1806,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1806,Obtaining a discount card in return for paying a certain amount,"In some bookshops there are advertisements for a scheme whereby the customer pays a set amount of money each month and gets two things: he will be supplied with new books in a specific area of interest, such as fiqh, etc, and he will get a 10% discount if he wants to buy books from these stores. What is the ruling on this?",,,"Praise be to Allah.This is a kind of gambling, concerning which Allaah says 
          (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic 
          drinks), gambling, al-ansaab (stone altars for making sacrifices to 
          idols, etc.) and al-azlaam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are 
          an abomination of Shaytaan’s handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that 
          (abomination)…” [al-Maa’idah 5:90]
Gambling means everything that involves one side trying 
          to take advantage of the other, so that one will be the winner and the 
          other will be the loser. This is the shar’i ruling on gambling. So a 
          man who pays 500 riyals every month, for example, may buy books for 
          which his discount adds up to more than a thousand riyals, or he may 
          not buy anything at all. If we suppose that he buys things for which 
          the discount adds up to more than five hundred riyals, then he will 
          be the winner, and the storekeeper will be the loser; if he does not 
          buy anything, then the storekeeper will be the winner and the man will 
          be the loser, because he paid 500 riyals and did not get anything in 
          return. This transaction is a kind of gambling and is not permissible.","Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh, Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 52/68"
1807,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1807,Repentance of One Suffering from a Terminal Disease,A man committed many sins. He is suffering from a severe illness and has tried treatment to no avail. The doctors have told him that they have no cure for his problem. Now he regrets his past and wants to repent. Does his repentance count now that he is suffering from this terminal illness from which he has no hope of a cure?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, the repentance of a man who does not hope to live for long does count. This applies whether he has an incurable illness such as cancer; or he has been sentenced to death, such as a man who has been brought out for execution, even if the sword is being raised above his head; or a married man who has committed adultery and been sentenced to stoning, even if the stones have already been gathered. His repentance is valid, because Allah accepts the repentance of a man so long as the death rattle has not yet reached his throat. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Allah accepts only the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and foolishness and repent soon afterwards; it is they to whom Allah will forgive, and Allah is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise.”
[4:17]
The meaning of the phrase “and repent soon afterwards” means that they repent before they die.
In the following ayah (verse), Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do evil deeds until death faces one of them and he says: ‘Now I repent.’”
[ 4:18]
There are five essential conditions for repentance: sincerity, regret for what one has done, giving it up immediately, determination not to repeat it in the future, and repenting during the time when repentance will be accepted, i.e., before one dies or before the sun rises in the west.","Liqa’ al-Bab al-Maftooh by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 53/73"
1808,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1808,"Advice: Separating women from non-mahram* men in 
family visits","What advice can you give Muslim families in regards to family 
visits and gatherings?",,,"Praise be to Allah.People are civil and sociable by nature: they must have friends, and 
friendship involves visiting one another.
When visits are between families, we must pay attention to an important 
matter which will close the door to evil, by not allowing mixing between the 
sexes. One of the indications that mixing is haraam is the aayah 
(interpretation of the meaning): "" And when you ask (the Prophet's 
wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen, that is 
purer for your hearts and for their hearts"" [al-Ahzaab 33:53]
If we examine the evil results of mixing in family gatherings, we will find 
many examples of corruption and immorality, for example:In most cases, women's hijaab in mixed gatherings is either 
non-existant or not correct. These women display the beauty which 
Allaah has forbidden them to show to anyone before whom they is 
not allowed to uncover, as it says in the aayah (interpretation of the 
meaning): "" and not to reveal their adornment "" [al-Noor 24:31] 
It even happens that women who adorn themselves in mixed 
gatherings never adorn themselves for their husbands.

When men see women in mixed gatherings, this destroys their 
religious commitment and morals, and provokes forbidden desires.

Terrible arguments and marital separations may result, when one 
looks at or winks at the wife of another, or they laugh and joke 
together. When the couple returns home, the settling of accounts 
begins:Man: ""Why did you laugh at so-and-so's words, when he never said 
anything funny?Woman: ""And why did you wink at so-and-so?""Man: ""When he speaks you understand him readily, but when I speak 
you never understand me!""
So the exchange of accusations goes on, until it ends in hatred or 
even divorce, in some cases.

Some men and women may begin to regret their luck in marriage, 
when they begin to compare their spouses with those of their friends. 
A man may say to himself, ""So-and-so joins in discussions and is 
well-educated, but my wife is ignorant and is not educated at all"" 
And a woman may say to herself, ""So-and-so is so lucky, her 
husband is so eloquent and smart, and my husband is so boring and 
speaks without thinking"" This destroys the marriage relationship 
and leads to bad treatment on the part of both spouses.

Some may show off to others by making false claims about what they 
do not have, so that one man may issue instructions to his wife in 
front of other men so that he can pretend to have a strong personality, 
when at home he is like a tame pussy-cat. A woman may borrow gold 
so that others in the gathering may think she owns so much, but the 
Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
""The one who claims to have what he does not own is as it were 
wearing a garment of falsehood."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, 9/317)

These mixed night-time gatherings are often a waste of time, filled 
with idle gossip and other sins of the tongue, whilst small children are 
left at home (so that the gathering will not be spoiled by their crying!)

These night-time gatherings may become even worse and involve 
other major sins, such as drinking and gambling, especially among the 
so-called upper class. Another of the major sins that may result is the 
desire to follow the kuffaar and be like them in dress and other habits 
and customs. The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings 
of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Whoever imitates a people is one of 
them."" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, al-Musnad, 2/50; see also Saheeh al-Jaami', 
2828)

In family gatherings, women should be separated from non-mahram men, 
and the gatherings should serve some useful purpose, such as 
remembrance of Allaah (dhikr), seeking beneficial knowledge or discussing 
social problems or things that can benefit the family in this life. We ask 
Allaah to keep us safe and healthy. May Allaah bless our Prophet 
Muhammad.

1809,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1809,"Should a person
    stand to the right of the imaam if the row is full?","What is the ruling on a person who
      cannot find a place to pray in the row so he stands to the right of the imaam?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Sunnah is that the imaam should stand in front of
    the other worshippers, if they are two or more, and no one should stand beside the imaam
    except in cases of absolute necessity, such as when the mosque is full and he can find
    nowhere to stand except beside the imaam, in which case there is nothing wrong with it. If
    there are only two other people and they have to stand beside the imaam, then one should
    stand to his right and the other to his left. They should not both stand to his right, as
    was originally prescribed; this was aborgated and the rule now is that they should both
    stand behind the imaam.
Many ordinary peple nowadays think that if two men need to stand with
    the imaam, they should both be on his right. There is no basis for this idea, but if there
    is only one man, he should stand only to the right of the imaam, nowhere else.","Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 54/93"
1810,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1810,"Selling on
  consignment and selling a product before it arrives","What, in your view, is the shar’i
      ruling on selling on consignment and selling goods bought from abroad before they arrive
      in one’s store?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The first question is: what is the ruling on selling on
    consignment? This means that a person says, I will sell you these goods – whatever
    you manage to sell will come under this deal, and whatever you do not sell, I will take
    back. This transaction in haraam, because it clearly involves an unknown element as
    neither the vendor nor the purchaser knows how much of the goods will be sold. The issue
    here is jahaalah (ignorance, not knowing). It was reported that the Prophet 
 (peace
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade sales that involve undue risk (gharar)
    and this is clearly a risky transaction.
But if the two sides have to do a deal, then the owner of the goods
    should give them to the other party to sell them on his behalf, and give him a reward for
    acting as his agent. This will achieve the aim of both parties, with the latter acting as
    an agent for the former. There is nothing wrong with this.
As for selling goods before they arrive, this is not permitted either,
    because the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade selling from the
    same place where goods are bought before the trader has actually acquired them (lit. added
    them to his own luggage). He should first take possession of them, then he can sell them.
    As for selling them when they are in another country, when he does not know if they will
    arrive intact or not, this is not permitted.
If a person were to say that the purchaser is obliged to accept the
    goods “as is”, whether they are defective or not, our response is: a person may
    agree to that, hoping to make a profit, but if the goods turn out to be defective, he will
    regret it and be upset, and a dispute may arise between him and the vendor. Islam –
    praise be to Allaah – has blocked the way to regret, disputes and conflict.
By the same token, if the goods get destroyed en route, conflicts may
    arise between the two parties. The point here is that it is not permitted to sell goods
    until they have have reached the vendor, then he may sell them.","Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 54/94"

Yes, this is permitted for removing armpit hair and pubic hair, because the 
point is to remove the hair. Any means of achieving the desired result is

1812,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1812,Ruling on sitting    with smokers when they are smoking,"It is no secret that the forbidden habit of smoking is widespread, in the workplace, in the home and in public areas. The question is, is it permissible to sit with smokers? If a person is sitting with a smoker in his home or in a public gathering, should he leave him and go out?",,,"Praise be to Allah.As the brother has mentioned, smoking is haraam because of the general evidence that indicates that it is haraam. There is no specific text from the Messenger SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because smoking only emerged recently, but the principles of sharee’ah are general in application, and some indications in some reports indicate that it is haraam. If a smoker sits next to you and wants to smoke, then advise him gently and kindly. Tell him, “My brother, this is haraam, and it is not permissible for you.”
I think that if you advise him kindly and gently, he will refrain from smoking, as we and others have found out by experience. If he does not refrain from smoking, then you have to leave him, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And it has already been revealed to you in the Book (this Qur’aan) that when you hear the Verses of Allaah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them…” [al-Nisa’ 4:140]
But this is when it is in a public place. If it is in the workplace and you advise him but he does not refrain, then there is no sin on you, because this is the matter of necessity and you could not get away from him.","Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 54/101"

      circumstances do not allow them to do so. Is it enough for them to listen to the tapes
      recorded by shaykhs, and will they then be like other seekers of knowledge?",,,"Praise be to Allah.With regard to whether this is enough for
    them, there is no doubt that this is good enough if they cannot go and be with the
    scholars. It makes up for not being able to be with the people of knowledge, although
    being with them is preferable and makes it easier to understand and discuss matters. But
    if they cannot do that, then listening to tapes is enough, because this is all they can
    do.
Can they be regarded as students or seekers of knowledge when
    they are limiting themselves to that? We say, yes they can, if they make a great effort,
    just as a person can become a scholar if he takes knowledge from books. But the difference
    between taking knowledge from books and tapes and receiving it directly from the scholars
    is that it is much better to take it directly from the scholars, because then it is easy
    to discuss things, unlike when listening to tapes or reading books. It requires a great
    deal of effort to learn all aspects of knowledge in this way. (By the same token, learning
    directly from scholars means that one is less likely to misunderstand things than when one
    learns from tapes and books).","Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 54/103"

Many people believe that

  content will remain. If you light the alcohol, as in flambé dishes, 75 
  per cent will remain. Even after simmering the dish for one and a half hours, 
  it will still have 20 per cent of the original alcohol content.
It is only if you simmer

1815,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1815,"Why will the
    people who ask others for Ruqyah be of a lesser status?","We want to understand the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both) in which the Prophet 
 (peace and
blessings of Allaah be upon him) says of the seventy thousand who will enter Paradise without being called to account that they “do not ask for ruqyah (seek healing
      through spiritual means e.g. by recitation of Qur’aan etc.)…” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 6472 and 6541; Muslim, no. 220).
Does this hadeeth include all kinds of treatment? If this is not
the case, what is the difference between (medical) treatment and ruqyah, because both of them may effect a cure? How are we to understand the Prophet’s command to ‘Aa’ishah and others to seek healing from al-‘ayn (the evil eye) through ruqyah? If we know that a person has been afflicted by the evil eye, should we tell him to seek healing through ruqyah or should we tell him to bear it with patience and hope for reward from Allaah?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The phrase in the hadeeth about the seventy thousand who
    will enter Paradise without being called to account, that they “do not ask for
    ruqyah” means that they do not seek it from others. But the Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded us and taught us to seek treatment, as he said:
    “Allaah has not created any disease without also creating the cure; some know it and
    some do not.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 5678).
    Ruqyah and seeking medical treatment differ in two ways:
The first difference is that a person will feel a greater attachment to
    the one who does ruqyah than to the one who offers medical treatment, because if Allaah
    decrees that he should be healed through ruqyah, the bond between the person who did the
    ruqyah and the person who was sick is a spiritual bond, as the cure did not come about
    through physical means. The fact that it is a spiritual bond may be a source of fitnah
    (temptation or trial), as he may say, “he is one of the awliya’ (close friends)
    of Allaah” and so on, which may lead him to shirk (associating partners with Allaah).
    Hence it was followed by the words “… and who put their trust in their
    Lord.”
The second difference is that a sick person may ask for ruqyah from
    someone who is not qualified to do it, because the latter is not using something tangible
    that can be identified. So the person who has been asked to do ruqyah may do it, and the
    sick person may be healed coincidentally, not as a result of the ruqyah which was not done
    according to sharee’ah, but at the same time as the ruqyah is done, so people may
    suffer fitnah because of this, and think that this is a person whose du’aa’s are
    answered and whose ruqyah is blessed, when this is not the case.
For this reason the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him) said, “… those who do not ask for ruqyah..” and did not say
    “those who do not seek treatment. Seeking treatment is essential, but it is better
    not to seek ruqyah. However, if a person comes forward and recites something over you and
    you do not stop him, this does not mean that you are not counted among the people
    mentioned in the hadeeth, because you did not ask for ruqyah. By the same token, if you do
    ruqyah for your brother, you are doing him a favour, and this does not rule you out from
    being one of the seventy thousand. Thus we say that the extra phrase reported in Saheeh
    Muslim, “… and they did not do ruqyah…” is a dubious addition
    that is not saheeh. The correct wording is only “Those who did not ask for
    ruqyah.”
With regard to seeking ruqyah from a scholar, if he is known as such
    then you can ask him for ruqyah, because if he treats a person with ruqyah, they will
    benefit from it, by the grace of Allaah, as is the case with doctors who treat people.
With regard to the question of whether we should treat the person who
    is afflicted by the evil eye with ruqyah or tell him to bear it with patience, the
    Messenger 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught us the way to seek healing
    from the evil eye, when he told the one who had put the evil eye on one of his companions
    to do ghusl and wudoo’, then to take some of the water and pour it over the one who
    was afflicted until he recovered.","Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 55/121"
1816,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1816,Renovating orphan’s property with zakaah money,"There are some orphans whose guardian I am, as their father died many years ago. They have a monthly income from their father’s retirement fund of 3500 riyaals. Over the years I have accumulated a large sum of money, of which approximately 150,000 comes from zakaah. Should I stop accepting zakaah on their behalf? What should I do with the zakaah money I have? They have a house that needs to be repaired, and there is still 240,000 owing to the real-estate company.

Can I pay off the deceased’s debts from this (zakaah) money? They have land from the city so can we pay for building a fence around it from this money?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly, it is not permissible for you to take zakaah on
    their behalf, because they have enough money of their own. Zakaah is for the poor and
    needy, not for orphans. Whatever you have taken at the time when they had enough of their
    own has to be given back to the original donors, if you know who they are, otherwise you
    must give it away in charity with the intention of it being zakaah on their behalf,
    because you took it with the intention of it being zakaah from them.
As for the money that you have accumulated from the retirement fund,
    use it as you see fit, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And
    come not near to the orphan’s property, except to improve it…”
    [al-An’aam 6:152].
As for the debt to the real estate development company, you know that
    it is to be repaid in installments, not all at once, so pay it back in installments. The deceased has nothing to do with it, except with regard to the installments that were due before his death, if he did not pay them. As for the installments that were not due until after his death, they are nothing to do with him because they have to do with this  property, the ownership of which has passed to his heirs. So they are responsible for these repayments, and they should not be paid from the zakaah money, because they have enough money of their own with which to pay them.","Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 55/126"

1.   The lender has to pay zakaah annually on the money lent, if the borrower is rich and is known to repay debts promptly. In this case, because it is possible to recover the money readily, it is like money that is in one's possession.
2.   The lender has to pay zakaah one full year after recovering the money if the borrower is in difficulty or is known to delay repayment. He does not have to pay zakaah before he gets the money back, because it is not readily accessible and this is not like money that is in one's possession.","Qaraaraat Majma' al-Fiqh al-Islami (Decisions of the Islamic Fiqh Council), p. 9"

And it is said that the recorded tapes that are in circulation (recordings of jinn supposedly speaking through people) are no proof of anything. What is your response to all this?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The fact that jinn can enter human bodies is proven in the Quran and Sunnah (prophetic teachings), and by the consensus of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama’ah (main body of Muslims who are united upon the sunnah), and by real-life events. No one disputes this apart from the M’utazilah (a deviant sect) who give priority to their own rational analysis over the evidence of the Quran and Sunnah. We will mention a little about this below:
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Those who eat riba (interest) will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaytan leading him to insanity. That is because they say: ‘Trading is only like Riba’…” [2:275]
Al-Qurtubi said in his Tafseer (exegesis): “This ayah (verse) is proof that those people are wrong who deny that epilepsy is caused by the jinn and claim that its causes are only physical, and that the Shaytan does not enter people or cause madness.”
Ibn Katheer said in his Tafseer, after mentioning the ayah quoted above: “They will not rise from their graves on the Day of Resurrection except like the way in which the epileptic rises during his seizure, when he is beaten by the Shaytan. This is because they will rise in a very bad state. Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: the one who consumes riba will rise on the Day of Resurrection crazy and choking.”
According to a saheeh hadeeth (authentic report) narrated by al-Nasai from Abu’l-Yusr, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray: “Allahumma innee a’oodhu bika min al-taraddi wa’l-haram wa’l-gharaq wa’l-harq, wa a’oodhu bika an yatakhabatani al-shaytan ‘ind al-mawt (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from being thrown from a high place, old age, drowning and burning; and I seek refuge with You from being beaten by the Shaytan at the time of death).” Commenting on this hadeeth in Al-Fayd, al-Manawi said: “[The phrase] ‘and I seek refuge with You from being beaten by the Shaytan at the time of death’ means, lest he should wrestle with me and play with me, and damage my religious commitment or mental state (at the time of death) by means of his insinuating whispers which cause people to slip or lose their minds. The Shaytan could take control of a person when he is about to depart this world, and misguide him or stop him from repenting…”
Ibn Taymiyah said: “The fact that jinn can enter human bodies is proven by the consensus of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
‘Those who eat riba will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaytan leading him to insanity. That is because they say: ‘Trading is only like riba’…’ [2:275].
And in as-Saheeh it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The Shaytan flows through the son of Adam as the blood flows through his veins.’”
‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal said: “I said to my father, ‘There are some people who say that the jinn do not enter the body of the epileptic.’ He said: ‘O my son, they are lying; the jinn could speak through this person.’” Commenting on this, Ibn Qudamah said: “What he said is well known, because a person may suffer an epileptic seizure and speak in a language that no one understands, and his body may be beaten with blows that would fell a camel, but the epileptic does not feel them at all, and he is also unaware of the words he is saying. The epileptic and others may be dragged about, or the carpet on which he is sitting may be pulled, and utensils may be moved about from place to place, and other things may happen. Anyone who witnesses such a thing will know for sure that the one who is speaking through the person and moving these things is not human.” And he said, may Allah have mercy on him: “There is no one among the imams (religious leaders/scholars) of the Muslims who denies that jinn may enter the body of the epileptic and others. Anyone who denies this and claims that Islam denies it is lying about Islam. There is nothing in the proofs of sharee’ah (Islamic law) to show that it does not happen.”
So the fact that jinn may enter human bodies is proven in the Quran and Sunnah, and by the consensus of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah, some of whose comments we have quoted above.
As regards the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): “but they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah’s Leave” [2:102], this is undoubtedly a clear indication that the jinn cannot harm anyone through witchcraft or epilepsy or through any other kind of disturbance or misguidance, except with the permission of Allah. As al-Hasan al-Basri said: “Whomever Allah wills, He gives them power over him, and whomever He does not will, He does not give them power over him, and they cannot do anything to anyone except with the permission of Allah.” The Shaytan (who is the disbelieving jinn) may gain power over the believers by making them sin and by making them neglect the remembrance and Tawheed of Allah (maintaining Allah’s Oneness) and sincerity in worshipping Him. But he has no power over the righteous slaves of Allah, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, My slaves (i.e. the true believers of Islamic Monotheism) — you have no authority over them. And All-Sufficient is your Lord as a Guardian.” [17:65]
During the Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic days of ignorance) the Arabs were well aware of this and mentioned it in their poetry. For example, the poet al-A’asha likened his she-camel’s energy to that of one who was touched by the jinn, and said that it was the jinn who was giving her energy.
As regards the causes of epilepsy, Ibn Taymiyah explained the causes. He said: “When the jinn touch a person with epilepsy, it may be because of desire or love, just as happens between one human and another… or it may – as is usually the case – be because of hatred and punishment, such as when a person has harmed them or they think that he has harmed them deliberately, either by urinating on them or pouring hot water on them or killing them, even if the person did that unknowingly. There are ignorant and wrongdoing ones among the jinn who may punish a person more than he deserves, or they may be playing with him and mistreating him, like foolish people among mankind.”
And I say: the way to save oneself from this is to remember Allah and speak His Name at the beginning of all things, as it was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to mention Allah in many cases, such as when eating, drinking, mounting his riding-beast, taking off his clothes for any reason, having intercourse and so on…
As regards treatment (of one whose body has been entered by the jinn), Ibn Taymiyah said (Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 19/42): “When the jinn attack a person, they should be told of the rulings of Allah and His Messenger, proof should be established against them, and they should be commanded to do what is good and told not to do what is evil, just as should be done in the case of people, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning)’ [al-Israa’ 17:15].” Then he said: “If the jinn does not leave after being addressed in this manner, then it is permissible to rebuke him, tell him off, threaten him and curse him, as the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did with the Shaytaan when he came with a falling star to throw it in his face, and the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I seek refuge with Allah from you and I curse you with the curse of Allah” – three times. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari).
We may also seek help against the jinn by remembering Allah (dhikr) and reciting Qur’an, especially Aayat al-Kursiy. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever recites it will remain under the protection of Allah and no Shaytaan (devil) will be able to approach him until the morning.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari). And al-Mi’wadhatayn (the last two soorahs of the Qur’an) may also be recited.
As for psychiatrists who do not treat the epileptic in the manner described, they cannot do him any good at all.
This issue may be discussed in much more detail, but what we have said here is sufficient for those who want to know a little about this matter, Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.","Masaa’il wa rasaa’il, Muhammad Mahmoud al-Najdi, p. 23"
1822,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1822,Letters of credit,"One of the practices which is well-known
      in the financial field nowadays is when a businessman wants to import a product, for
      example, he asks the bank for a letter of credit for a certain amount, either in his own
      account or from the bank itself, and the bank takes some form of payment for providing
      this letter of credit. What is the ruling on this?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Lord of the Worlds.
    Firstly: Letters of credit may be of different types, initial or final.
    Either type of letter of credit may or may not be covered by the balance in the
    businessman’s account. If it is not covered, then the the issuer bears joint
    liability with the applicant with regard to current and future obligations. This is
    essentially what is known in Islamic fiqh as damaan (liability) or kafaalah
    (sponsorship or surety).
If the letter of credit is covered, then the relationship between the
    one who is requesting it and the provider (the bank) is that of an agency. Acting as an
    agent is valid whether or not a fee is paid, so long as the agent relationship serves the
    interest of the one for whom it is done (in this case the third party from whom the good
    are being purchased). 
Kafaalah (sponsorship) is a voluntary agreement whose purpose is
    goodwill. The fuqaha’ have stated that it is not permissible to accept a fee in
    return for it, because in that case when the sponsor (kafeel) receives a sum of money when
    the credit is paid, it becomes like a loan which brought some benefit to the lender, which
    is not allowed in Islam [because it is like riba or interest – Translator].
On this basis, the following is clear:
Firstly: that it is not permissible to charge a fee for issuing a
    letter of credit – which usually takes into account the amount of money and length of
    time involved – whether the credit is covered or not.
Secondly: charging administration fees for preparing either type of
    letter of credit is permissible, so long as the amount charged does not exceed what is
    usual, whether the letter of credit is wholly or partly covered. In evaluating the
    administration fee for issuing a letter of credit, it should be taken into account what is
    actually involved in doing so. And Allaah knows best.","Qaraaraat Majma’ al-Fiqh al-Islami, p. 25"

      person the relief of dying. On the other hand, however, he fears that by turning the life
      support systems off, he is depriving the person of the opportunity to continue living.
      When is it permissible to turn off the life support systems in the case of people who are

1839,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1839,"Paying “key-money”
    (money for vacating a property)","In many cities, markets and streets
      where there are important locations, some tenants willingly give up their tenancies to
      others in return for a certain amount of money. What is the ruling on this?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly, there are four types of transaction that may come under this
    heading, as follows:
Where there is an agreement to this effect from the outset between the
        landlord of the property and the tenant.

Where the tenant and landlord come to an agreement during the period of
        the tenancy or after it has ended.

Where there is an agreement between the tenant and a new tenant, during
        the period of the tenancy or after it has ended.

Where there is an agreement between the new tenant and both the landlord
        and the first tenant, before the first tenancy expires or afterwards.

Secondly, if the landlord and tenant agree that the tenant will pay a
    certain amount of money in addition to the regular rent – which in some countries is
    called a deposit – there is nothing Islamically wrong with paying this amount,
    provided that it is counted as part of the rent for the agreed period; when the contract
    comes to an end, this amount is subject to the rulings on rents.
When the rental period comes to an end, and is not renewed explicitly
    or implicitly – in cases where automatic renewal is provided for in a clause of the
    lease – it is not permitted to pay this money, because the landlord has more right to
    the property once the tenant no longer has any right to it.
Fourthly, if an agreement is reached between the first tenant and the
    new tenant during the period of the tenancy agreement that the former will give up the
    remainder of his lease in return for a sum of money over and above the regular rent, this
    transaction is permissible, provided that attention is paid to the terms of the contract
    drawn up between the landlord and the first tenant, because many rental agreements
    expressly state that tenants are not allowed to sublet properties to other parties or to
    accept “key-money” except with the agreement of the landlord. If this is the
    case, it must be adhered to.
If the agreement between the first tenant and the new tenant is reached
    after the expiry of the lease, it is haraam to pay key-money, because the first tenant no

The sale is not valid unless both parties are certain about either cash or installments. If there is some indecision with regard to cash or installments, and the two parties fail to reach an agreement on one specific price, then the sale is not permissible according to Shari`ah.
·         According to Shari`ah, it is not permissible in the case of payment by installments, to state interest rates as a separate item based on the length of time taken to repay, regardless of whether the two parties agree on the rate of interest or it is based on the current rate.
·         If the purchaser is late in paying the installments, it is not permissible to make him pay extra , whether or not this is arranged as a prior condition, because this is a form of forbidden Riba.
·         It is forbidden for a debtor who can afford the installments to delay payment when they are due. At the same time, according to Shari`ah it is not permissible to set a condition that he should pay compensation in the event of late payments.
·         According to Shari`ah, it is permissible to set a condition that the debtor has to bring forward the payment, if he delays some of the payments , so long as the debtor agrees to this condition at the time when the contract is drawn up.
·         The vendor does not have the right to keep the purchaser’s property after the item has been sold, but it is permissible for the vendor to stipulate some security as a guarantee that the purchaser will pay the installments. (Majma Al-Fiqh Al-Islami, p. 109)
·         It is permissible according to Shari`ah to reduce the amount owing in order to expedite the settlement of the matter, whether this is done by request of the vendor or the purchaser. This is not counted as forbidden Riba so long as it is not based on a prior agreement and so long as this agreement between the two parties is reached on a one-on-one basis, without the involvement of any third party, because in that case the rulings on the settlement of business accounts would apply.
·         It is permissible for the two parties to agree that all installments should be paid immediately if the debtor fails to make one payment, unless he is in difficulty and has no means of paying.
·         If the debt becomes due because the debtor dies, becomes bankrupt or delays payment, then in any of these circumstances it is permissible to reduce the debt so that the matter may be settled quickly to the mutual satisfaction of both parties.
·         The definition of hardship which means that the vendor should wait for payment is: that the debtor should not have more wealth or property than he needs to meet his basic requirements and pay his debt.

    offer [of goods or services] and this is accepted, within the framework of shar'i
    conditions and in the absence of anything that might invalidate the transaction. An
    example of this in the case of a sale might be when the vendor says I sell this to
    you and the purchaser says I agree. There have been major developments
    in the field of communications which are now widely used to speed up financial dealings
    and transactions, which we must bear in mind whilst also taking into account what the
    fuqahaa have said about carrying out transactions via letter, in writing, by means
    of gestures or through intermediaries. They also established that transactions should be
    carried out between two parties who are present in the same place  with the
    exception of wills, the appointment of executors and the giving of power of attorney; the
    offer and agreement should both refer to the same thing and price, there should be no
    expression or indication that either party is turning away from the deal, and the
    agreement to an offer should not be delayed beyond whatever timespan is customarily
    regarded as acceptable.
In the light of the above, the fuqahaa have established the
    following:
If the transaction is carried out between two parties who are not
        present in the same place where one can actually see the other or hear his voice, and the
        only means of communication between them is by writing, mail, sending a messenger, this
        applies also to telegraphs, telexes, faxes and computer screens, in these cases the
        transaction is complete when the offer reaches the prospective purchaser and he agrees to
        it.

If the transaction is drawn up at the same time, between two parties who
        are in different locations  which applies to telephones and wireless communications
         the contract between them is considered to be a contract drawn up between two
        parties who are present in the same place, and in this case the basic rulings as stated by
        the fuqahaa and referred to in al-Deebaajah apply.

If the vendor makes a limited-time offer through these means of
        communication, he is bound by it for the duration and he cannot go back on it.

The rules outlined above do not include nikaah (marriage contracts)
        because of the requirement of two witnesses in nikaah, or barter because there has to be
        an actual exchange of goods or services, or forward buying, because this requires a cash
        down-payment.

In cases where there is the possibility of forgery, fraud or error,
        reference should be made to the general rules concerning the establishment of proof.l

        example, he is over-strict, hot-tempered or easily-provoked, or gets angry a lot, or
        criticizes her and rebukes her for the slightest mistake or shortcoming, then she has the
        right of khula’ [female-instigated divorce].

If she dislikes his physical appearance because of some deformity or
        ugliness, or because one of his faculties is missing, she has the right of khula’.

If he is lacking in religious commitment – for example, he
        doesn’t pray, or neglects to pray in jamaa’ah, or does not fast in Ramadaan
        without a proper excuse, or he goes to parties where haraam things are done, such as
        fornication, drinking alcohol and listening to singing and musical instruments, etc.
        – she has the right of khula’.

If he deprives of her of her rights of spending on her maintenance,
        clothing and other essential needs, when he is able to provide these things, then she has
        the right to ask for khula’.

If he does not give her her conjugal rights and thus keep her chaste
        because he is impotent (i.e. unable to have intercourse), or because he does not like her,
        or he prefers someone else, or he is unfair in the division of his time [i.e., among
        co-wives], then she has the right to ask for khula’.

1863,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1863,Meaning of Al-Mala al-A’ala,I am a non-Muslim who is currently enrolled in class studying Muslim traditions. I am writing a paper on the interpretation of prophets by commentators. One of the words being repeated is al-mala al-a'ala. I do not know what this means. I know that al-a'ala means the most high. Could you please help me with this? I appreciate your time and your help.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The phrase al-mala al-a’ala is mentioned in both the Quran and the sunnah 
    (prophetic teachings).
    In Surah Saad, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
    ""‘I had no knowledge of the chiefs (angels) on high when they were disputing 
    and discussing (about the creation of Adam). Only this has been inspired to 
    me, that I am a plain warner.’"" [38:69-70]
    In his commentary on this ayah (verse), Shaykh al-Mufassireen Ibn Jareer al-Tabari 
    (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""‘I had no knowledge of the chiefs on 
    high (al-mala al-a’ala) when they were disputing and discussing’: here Allah 
    is telling His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) , 
    ‘O Muhammad, say to the mushrikeen (polytheists) among your people: ""I had 
    no knowledge of the chiefs (angels) on high when they were disputing and 
    discussing"" about the creation of Adam before Allah revealed this to me.’ 
    What this means is: ‘My telling you about this is clear proof that this 
    Quran is a Revelation from Allah, because you know that I had no knowledge 
    of this before this Quran was revealed; it is not something I witnessed with 
    my own two eyes – I know it only because Allah has informed me of it.’"" 
    Other scholars of tafseer (exegesis) have said something similar to this.
    The comments of other scholars:
    Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) said: ""Allah’s 
    words (interpretation of the meaning) ‘I had no knowledge of the chiefs on 
    high when they were disputing and discussing’ refer to the angels, when they 
    were consulted about the creation of Adam, and they disputed it and said: Do 
    not place a khaleefah (vicegerent) on earth.""
    Al-Sa’adi said: ""‘… The chiefs on high when they were disputing and 
    discussing’ means: ‘… when your Lord said to the angels: ""Verily, I am going 
    to place (mankind) generations after generations on earth""…’ [2:30]
    Qutadah said: ""The words ‘I had no knowledge of the chiefs on high when they 
    were disputing and discussing’ refer to the angels, who disputed the 
    creation of Adam when Allah said to them, (interpretation of the meaning) 
    ‘Truly, I am going to create man from clay’.” [38:71].
    As regards what was reported in the sunnah, Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased 
    with him and his father) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and 
    blessings of Allah be upon him) said that Allah spoke to him in a dream and 
    said, ""O Muhammad, do you know what the chiefs on high are disputing about?… 
    about the things which expiate for sins. Things that expiate for sins are: 
    staying in the mosque after the prayers, walking to join congregational 
    prayers and performing wudu properly when it is difficult to do so. Whoever 
    does these things will have a good life and die a good death, and he will be 
    as free from sin as on the day his mother bore him."" [Al-Tirmidhi])
    In his commentary on this hadeeth (narration), al-Mubarakpuri explained that 
    ""the chiefs on high"" (al-mala al-a’ala) referred to the angels who are 
    closest to Allah. Al-mala refers to nobles who attend gatherings and sit at 
    their head because of their high status. They are described as al-a’ala 
    either because they live on high, or because of their high status in the 
    sight of Allah. Their ""dispute"" refers either to their competing or rushing 
    to record these deeds and take them up to heaven, or to their discussing the 
    virtue and blessing of these deeds, or to their feeling happy about people 
    when they do these good deeds. It may have been called a ""dispute"" because 
    it came in the form of questions and answers, which sounds like a dispute or 
    a debate, hence it was appropriate to use the word ""dispute"" in this 
    context.

1875,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1875,Who    has the most right to lead the prayers?,"I have a question regarding arrogance and becoming an imam.
In my community there are a few Muslims that always assume that they are the ""most noble and learned"" of the Muslims in the community and always assume the imam position in prayer, and never request that another brother go ahead. In fact, before the iqamah is recited these Muslims are already at the imam's mu-salla. The never request another brother to become imam, and one of them even said ""there is no one here more qualified than myself."" I do not know the exact reason why some of these Muslims feel that they are the most qualified, but I think it is because they feel that they are the oldest among the jama'ah or longest living in the community or even that they are of a particular nationality or dress.
I also know that there are some brothers who have alhamdulillah memorized much of the Qur'aan but they never want to become imam because they do not want to be associated or in competition with the arragant ones.
Please forgive me for this somewhat long message, but is it permissible or even preferred for these Muslims who may be learned to deny becoming the imam because of perhaps humility? Are these two situations (the assuming of becoming imam and the denying of it) two extremes that Allaah may be displeased with? If so, what should the people in the jama'ah do in this situation?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Many saheeh ahadith have been narrated which explain to the Muslims who is most qualified and has the most right to lead the prayers. One of these ahadith is that which was narrated from Abu Saeed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
If there are three people, let one of them lead the others in prayer, and the one who has the most right to lead them is the one who knows more Quran.
(Narrated by Muslim, no. 1077).
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
The people should be led in prayer by the one who has most knowledge of the Quran and has been reciting it for longer. If they are equal in their knowledge and reading of the Quran, then they should be led by the one who made hijrah first. If they are equal with regard to hijrah, then they should be led by the one who is older
(Narrated by Muslim, 1079).
To sum up what is indicated by these ahadith, the one who has the most right to lead the others in prayer is: the one who has most knowledge of the Book of Allah and of the fiqh of salah.
Those who knew more of the Book of Allah were appointed to lead the prayers at the time of the Sahaabah, because they had learned the correct way of reciting the aayat and they had learned the knowledge contained therein and the deeds prescribed by the Quran. So they combined knowledge and action [they acted upon what they had learned], and did not stop at merely memorizing as is the case nowadays. How many people learn all or part of the Quran, take care to recite it properly and with a beautiful voice, but they do not know anything about the fiqh of salah.
If they are equal with regard to knowledge of the Quran, then the one who knows more about the Sunnah should lead the prayer. If they are equal with regard to knowledge of the Sunnah, then the one who made hijrah first should lead the prayer. If they are equal with regard to hijrah, or if this does not apply, then the one who is older should lead the prayer, as is indicated in the hadeeth of Maalik ibn al-Huwayrith, who said:
We came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and we were young people, close in age. We stayed with him for twenty days, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was kind to us. When he thought that we were missing our families, he asked us about those whom we had left behind, and we told him. He said, Go back to your families and stay with them. Teach them and instruct them and he said some things I remembered and some that I forgot. And pray as you have seen me praying. When the time for prayer comes, let one of you call the Adhaan and let the oldest among you lead the prayer.
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 6705). If they are equal with regard to recitation of the Quran, knowledge and hijrah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded that the eldest of them should be appointed to lead the prayer. If they are equal in age, then the one who is most righteous (has most taqwaa) should be appointed, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
Verily, the most honourable of you with Allah is that (believer) who has al-Taqwaa (is one of the pious) [al-Hujuraat 49:13]. If they are equal in all regards, then they should draw lots, if there is a dispute.
Having a PhD or having lived the longest in the land of the kuffaar does not qualify a person to lead the prayers. The one who has memorized more Quran and has more knowledge of the fiqh of salah is the one who should be appointed. It is not right for Muslims to dispute over the leadership of the prayers on the basis of their personal whims and desires. They should appoint the person who is described by shareeah as being qualified to lead the prayers. We ask Allah to reform the Muslims.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Neither of the two customs which you mention have any basis in Islamic texts. We 
should follow the Sunnah and keep away from innovations in religion. The best 
guidance is the guidance of Muhammad

innovated; every innovation is a bidah and every bidah is a going astray.
Know, may Allaah help me and you, that the reservation concerning this matter does 
not have to do with shaking hands with a Muslim brother or raising the hands in duaa 
to Allaah; it has to do with the timing of these two actions, following the prayer, and 
making them a regular habit. If one were to raise ones hands between the adhaan and 
the iqaamah, as is encouraged in the Sunnah, or shake hands when meeting ones 
brothers on the way into or out of the mosque, or when seeing a brother next to one

two things:

1. buy bonds, which will cover any problem with the contractor if he

First of all, thank you for your kind words of encouragement.
Secondly, buying bonds is a haraam riba-based (interest-based) transaction, as entering

should seek Allaah’s help and put your trust in Him, then choose a contractor who is

clearly states conditions. You may find that the system and courts in your country will 
ensure that you are given your rights should something untoward happen. We ask
