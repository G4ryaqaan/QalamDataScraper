      If he knows that he is offering the eclipse prayer, then he 
      should not join him, because of the difference in nature between the two 
      prayers. Although the eclipse prayer is two rak'ahs, each rak’ah includes 
      two bowings, two standings and two recitations. So whoever does not 
      realize that the imam is offering the eclipse prayers and join the imam 
      with the intention of praying Fajr should form the intention of praying 
      separately from the imam when he realizes that the imam is offering the 
      eclipse prayer. Then he should complete his prayer as Fajr and then if he 
      wants he may join the imam for whatever is left of the eclipse prayer.

    money may be spent are defined in the Qur’aan, where Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “As-Sadaqaat (here it means Zakaah) are only for the 
    Fuqaraa’ (poor), and Al‑Masaakeen(the poor) and those 
    employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have 
    been inclined (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in 
    debt; and for Allaah’s Cause (i.e. for Mujaahidoon — those fighting in a 
    holy battle), and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from 
    everything); a duty imposed by Allaah. And Allaah is All-Knower, All-Wise”

    [al-Tawbah 9:60]

    If the orphan falls into one of these categories, such as if 
    he is poor or needy, it is permissible to give zakaah to him.  

    Simply describing a person as an orphan does not mean that he 
    is entitled to zakaah funds, because he may be rich and have sufficient 
    wealth to make him independent of means. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was 
    asked about giving zakaah to sponsor orphans and he replied: 
Orphans who are poor are 
    among those who are entitled to zakaah, so if the zakaah is given to their 
    guardians, this is sufficient, if they are trustworthy. So their guardians 
    may be given what will cover their needs and he may buy what they need 
    himself. End quote. 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 
    18/346 

    He also said: 

    But there is a point which should be noted: some people think 
    that all orphans are entitled to zakaah funds, and that is not the case. 
    Orphans are not one of the categories of people who are entitled to take 
    zakaah, and an orphan has no right to zakaah unless he falls into one of the 
    eight categories of those who are entitled to zakaah. 

    As for simply being an orphan, an orphan may be independent 
    of means and have no need of zakaah (end quote). 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 
    18/353 

    He also said: 
We must understand that 
    zakaah is not for orphans as such; zakaah is for the poor and needy, and the 
    other categories (mentioned in the aayah). An orphan may be rich; his father 
    may have left him wealth that makes him independent of means, or he may have 
    an income from social security and the like which makes him independent of 
    means. 

    Hence we say that the orphan’s guardian should not accept 
    zakaah if the orphan has sufficient wealth to make him independent of 
    means. 

    As for charity, it is mustahabb to give it to orphans even if 
    they are independent of means. End quote.

With regard to giving 
    zakaah to the poor in installments, we have stated in the answer to question 
    no. 52852 that that is not 
    permissible, because it is delaying zakaah after one year has passed; but if 
    it is paid earlier, there is nothing wrong with giving it in installments to 
    the poor in that case, because it is not being delayed until after it has 
    become due.

66133,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66133,Making the second rak’ah long and the first rak’ah short,What is the ruling on praying behind an imam who makes the first rak’ah short and makes the second rak’ah long?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The Sunnah in prayer is 
    to make the first rak’ah long and the second short, because of the report 
    narrated by al-Bukhaari (759) and Muslim (685) from Abu Qataadah (may Allaah 
    be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) used to recite in the first two rak'ahs of Zuhr prayer 
    the Opening of the Book (al-Faatihah) and two soorahs, making the first 
    rak’ah long and the second short, and he made his recitation audible 
    sometimes. In ‘Asr he used to recite the Opening of the Book and two 
    soorahs, making the first rak’ah long. And he used to make the first rak’ah 
    of Fajr prayer long and the second short. 

    Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) included this 
    hadeeth in a chapter in his Saheeh entitled, “Chapter on making the 
    first rak’ah long.” In this chapter he reported the hadeeth of Abu Qataadah 
    which says that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    used to make the first rak’ah long in Zuhr prayer and the second rak’ah 
    short, and he also did that in Fajr prayer. 

    Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said: The phrase  “Chapter on making the 
    first rak’ah long” refers to all the prayers, which is apparent from the 
    hadeeth mentioned. End quote from Fath al-Baari, 2/305 

    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The phrase “he 
    used to make the first rak’ah long in Zuhr prayer and the second rak’ah 
    short” is something concerning which the scholars differed with regard to 
    following the apparent meaning. There are two views among our companions, 
    the more well known of which is that it should not be made lengthy, and the 
    hadeeth is to be understood as meaning that it was made long because of the 
    opening du’aa’ and prayers for refuge with Allaah, or because he sensed that 
    someone was about to join the prayer, and so on, not because of recitation. 
    The second view is that it is mustahabb to make the recitation long in the 
    first rak’ah on purpose. This is the correct view which is in accordance 
    with the Sunnah. End quote from Sharh Muslim, 4/175 

    Based on this, if the imam makes the second rak’ah longer 
    than the first, and he always does that and makes it a habit, then this is 
    contrary to the Sunnah, and he should be advised to follow the Sunnah of the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), for the best 
    guidance is the guidance of Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him). But making the first rak’ah long than the second is not

66138,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66138,Should she give the fidyah to her children and grandchildren or others as an iftar meal?,"My mother is unable to fast in Ramadaan, hence I pay the fidyah on her behalf every Ramadaan. Is it permissible for the fidyah to be given to her children and grandchildren as an iftaar meal?

 Or is it permissible to give the fidyah for not fasting to some students in school?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    If a person is unable to fast because of old age or sickness 
    from which there is no hope of recovery, then he is allowed not to fast, but 
    he should feed one poor person for each day, because Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And as for those who can 
    fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast 
    or) to feed a Miskeen (poor person) (for every day)”

    [al-Baqarah 2:184]

    ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) 
    said: This has not been abrogated, it refers to an old man or an old woman 
    who cannot fast; they should feed one poor person for each day. Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 4505. 

    This also applies if a person is sick and there is no hope of 
    recovery, as in the case of an old man who cannot fast. Al-Mughni, 
    4/396 

    Hence it may be understood that this fidyah (ransom) is to be 
    given only to the poor, not to everyone. 

    If the children, grandchildren and students mentioned in the 
    question are rich and are not poor, it is not permissible to give this 
    fidyah to them. 

    Secondly: 

    As for giving this fidyah to her children and grandchildren, 
    the scholars consider this fidyah to be like zakaah; it is not permissible 
    for a person to give it to those on whom he is obliged to spend. 

    Among those on whom one is obliged to spend are ascendants 
    and descendants. 

    Ascendants are the father, the mother, the grandfathers and 
    the grandmothers. 

    Descendants are sons and daughters and their children. 

    Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (11/374): 

    It is obligatory to spend on grandfathers and grandmothers, 
    no matter how far the line of ascent reaches, and on one’s children’s 
    children, no matter how far the line of descent reaches. This is also the 
    view of al-Shaafa’i and al-Thawri, and of ashaab al-ra’i. End quote. 

    Based on this, it is not permissible to give the fidyah 
    mentioned here to children and grandchildren, because your mother is obliged 
    to spend on them. 

    Al-Shaafa’i said in al-Umm (7/68): 

    It is not permissible to give food as expiation for a vow to 
    anyone except a free Muslim who is in need; if the food is given to a dhimmi 
    (non-Muslim living under Muslim rule) who is in need, or to a Muslim who is 
    not in need, that does not count and the ruling is the same as one who did 
    not do that; in that case he has to repeat it. The same applies if he gives 
    food to one on whom he is obliged to spend. End quote 

    It says in Asna al-Mataalib (3/369): 

    With regard to the poor and needy, they are regarded as being 
    among those who are entitled to zakaah, and it does not count if it is given 
    to a kaafir… or to one on whom one is obliged to spend… because the kafaarah 
    (expiation) is a duty that is owed to Allaah, so the same conditions apply 
    as with zakaah. End quote. 

    But if your mother cannot afford to spend on them, because 
    she is not rich, then she is not obliged to spend on them, because Allaah 
    says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope”

    [al-Baqarah 2:286]

    In this case, it is permissible for her to give this fidyah 
    to them. 

    It is proven in al-Saheehayn that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to a man who had 
    intercourse with his wife during the day in Ramadaan, when the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave him some dates to give as 
    an expiation and the man told the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) that he was the poorest household in Madeenah – the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him, “Give 
    them to your family.” 

    Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath: 

    Ibn Daqeeq al-‘Eid said: There are different views concerning 
    this story. It was said that it indicates that the kafaarah (expiation) is 
    waived in cases of hardship, because the expiation cannot be given to one’s 
    own self or one’s dependents. 

    The majority said that the expiation is not waived in cases 
    of hardship, and that what he was given permission to do was not by way of 
    expiation, rather it was charity that was given by the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to this man and his family. 

    And it was said that because he could not afford to spend on 
    his family, he was permitted to give this expiation to them. This is the 
    apparent meaning of the hadeeth. Shaykh Taqi al-Deen (i.e., Shaykh al-Islam 
    Ibn Taymiyah) said: A stronger view is that it was given not as an 
    expiation, but as a charity to him and his family, because it is apparent 
    that they were in need. End quote. 

    From the above it may be understood that it is not 
    permissible to give the expiation to those on whom one is obliged to spend, 
    but if a person is poor and cannot spend on them, then some of the scholars 
    are of the view that it is permissible to give the expiation to them. 

    In the answer to question no. 
    20278 we have quoted the fatwa 
    of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) which says that it 
    is permissible to give zakaah to relatives on whom one cannot spend because 
    of poverty and lack of wealth. 

    It says there: If he gives the zakaah to his relatives who 
    are entitled to zakaah, that is better than giving it to those who are not 
    relatives, because charity given to a relative is both charity and upholding 
    the ties of kinship. 

    But if these relatives are among those on whom one is obliged 
    to spend, and you give them zakaah so that you will not have to spend on 
    them from your wealth, this is not permissible. 

    But if you cannot afford to spend on them, then there is no 
    sin in giving them your zakaah. End quote. 

    In conclusion: If your mother is rich and can afford to spend 
    on them, then it is not permissible for her to give them her fidyah or 
    expiation. If she cannot afford to spend on them, it is permissible for her 
    to give them her fidyah or expiation. 

    Thirdly: 

    If she gives it by way of offering iftaar to one who is 
    fasting, there is nothing wrong with that, because of the general meaning of 
    the verse: “to feed a Miskeen (poor person)”. There is the hope that 
    this will bring a greater reward, because it is giving iftaar to one who is 
    fasting. But that is subject to the condition that the fasting person be 
    poor, as stated above.",Islam Q&A
66144,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66144,He is asking about the sites for cupping,What is the ruling on cupping during Ramadaan? What are the sites for cupping? Please also explain the illnesses that may be treated at each site.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 
In the answer to question 
    no. 38023 we stated that cupping is one of the things that invalidate the 
    fast, hence it is not permissible to do it except in the case of sick person 
    who is in need of it, in which case he may be treated with cupping and break 
    his fast, and he has to make that day up later on.  

    Secondly: 

    With regard to the sites of cupping: 

    1 – al-Bukhaari (2156) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah 
    be pleased with him) said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) was treated with cupping on his head when he was in ihraam, and 
    for some kinds of pain.” It was also narrated by Muslim (1203) from the 
    hadeeth of Ibn Buhaynah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was treated with cupping on 
    the road to Makkah when he was in ihraam, in the middle of his head. 
2 – Abu Dawood (3860), 
    al-Tirmidhi (390) and Ibn Maajah (3483) narrated from Anas (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) was treated with cupping three times in the two veins at the side 
    of the neck and the base of the neck. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in 
    Saheeh Abi Dawood. 

    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Cupping in 
    the veins at the side of the neck is beneficial for sicknesses of the head 
    and its parts, such as the face, teeth, ears, eyes, nose and throat, if the 
    cause is an excess of blood or corruption of the blood, or both. End quote 
    from Zaad al-Ma’aad, 4/51. 

    3 – Abu Dawood (3863) narrated from Jaabir (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) was treated with cupping on his hip for a pain in that 
    site. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 

    4 – al-Nasaa’i (2849) narrated from Anas (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) was treated with cupping when he was in ihraam, on the 
    back of his foot, for a pain in that site. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani 
    in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i. 
So these five sites are 
    proven in the Sunnah: The head, the two veins at the side of the neck, the 
    base of the neck, the hip and the back of the foot. 

    There are other sites which are known to those who are 
    specialized in cupping. 

    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Cupping 
    beneath the chin is beneficial for pains in the teeth, face and throat, if 
    it is used at the right time. It purifies the head and hands. Cupping on the 
    top of the foot is a substitution for venesection of the saafin, 
    which is a large vein in the heel; it is beneficial for treating abscesses 
    of the thigh and calf, cessation of menses and itching in the testicles. 
    Cupping at the bottom of the chest is beneficial for the treatment of sores, 
    scabies and pustules on the thighs, and of gout and scabies.  

    End quote from Zaad al-Ma’aad, 4/53 

    For more details on the diseases that may be treated by 
    cupping, and the sites that are suitable for cupping, please contact those 
    who are skilled in cupping.

 A while ago, someone asked me to market 400,000 tonnes of imported cement to the traders who deal with me, in return for a share of the profit (commission). 
My question is: is this percentage halal or haram?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
It is permissible to work as a customs broker in return for payment, subject to the condition that the goods handled are things in which it is permissible to trade. 
Secondly: 
With regard to what you say about this amount of cement, if it is something that is allowed, then there is nothing wrong with you marketing it in return for payment. 
This work of yours comes under the heading of brokerage (samsarah), i.e., acting as an intermediary between the seller and the buyer. In the answer to the question ( 45726 ) we have explained that working as a broker is permissible, and we have discussed the scholars’ opinions on this matter. 
If you take the cement from its owner and sell it to the buyer yourself, then you are an agent of the seller, and there is nothing wrong with an agent accepting payment in return for his work. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (7/204): 
It is permissible to appoint an agent or delegate someone to do something with or without payment, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) delegated Unays to carry out hadd punishments and ‘Urwah to buy a sheep without giving them any payment, and he used to send his agents to collect the zakah, and he paid them for that. Hence two of his cousins said to him: “Why don’t you send us to collect this charity and give us what you give the people, and we will collect for you what the people (i.e., the agents) collect, and we will earn wages like they do.” Narrated by Muslim, no. 1072. 
So if a person is appointed as an agent to buy or sell, then he is entitled to payment for his work. End quote. 
There is nothing wrong with making the wages of the broker or agent a known percentage. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
There is nothing wrong with paying a fee to the broker for finding a seller or a buyer, and there is nothing wrong with stipulating this payment.""(Fatawa Ibn Baz, 19/31 )
The Standing Committee was asked: 
There is a great deal of discussion about the fees charged for finding buyers and sellers. Some charge 2.5% and some charge 5%. What is the price prescribed in sharee’ah? Or is it something to be agreed upon by the seller and the broker? 
He replied: 
If the broker, the seller and buyer agree that the broker will be given a certain fee by the buyer or the seller or by both of them, that is permissible. There is no set limit for this fee, rather whatever is agreed upon by the one who pays is permissible. But it should be within the limits of what is customary among the people, it should benefit the broker in return for his work as an intermediary between the seller and the buyer, and it should not harm either the seller or the buyer by being more than the customary price.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 13/130 )
They also said: 
It is permissible for the broker to take a fee which is a fixed percentage of the price of the goods in return for his work, from the seller or the buyer, according to whatever has been agreed, without any injustice or wrongdoing. End quote. 
If it is a percentage of the profit and not of the price of the goods, then the Hanafi scholars have stated that this is permissible, and that it is akin to mudaarabah (profit sharing). Mudaarabah is when a man gives his money to someone who will trade with it in return for a percentage of the profits. See Mataalib Ooli al-Nuha, 3/543; Kashshaaf al-Qinaa’, 3/615 
The point is that there is nothing wrong with you accepting the agreed-upon percentage (commission).

The person to whom that

    has begun. He should refrain from eating and drinking for the rest of the 
    day, and he should make up that day according to the majority of scholars, 
    and there is no sin on him, because when he ate and drank he did not know

    Some scholars are of the view that fasting is valid in this

    The words of Hishaam, “It has to be made up” were said by him

    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded them to make it up. Hence 
    al-Haafiz said:

     As for the hadeeth of Asma’, it cannot be deduced from it 
    that it should be made up or that it should not. End quote.  

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ 
    (6/402): 
So they broke their fast 
    during the day based on their assumption that the sun had set but they were 
    unaware not of the shar’i ruling but of the situation. They did not think 
    that it was still daytime. But the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) did not tell them to make it up; if making it up had 
    been obligatory it would have been the law of Allaah and it would have been 
    known, but since it was not known and was not narrated from the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), the basic principle is that the 
    duty has been discharged and it does not have to be made up. End quote. 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa 
    (25/231): 
This indicates that it 
    is not obligatory to make it up. If the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) had told them to make it up, that would have been well 
    known as it is narrated that they broke their fast. Since that was not 
    narrated, this indicates that he did not tell them to do that. If it is 
    said, that it was said to Hishaam ibn ‘Urwah, “Were they commanded to make 
    it up?” and he said, “Is there any other alternative?” – the answer is that 
    Hishaam said that on the basis of his own opinion and did not narrate that 
    in the hadeeth. The fact that he did not have any knowledge of that is 
    indicated by the fact that Ma’mar is reported to have said: I heard Hishaam 
    say: I do not know whether they made it up or not. Both were narrated from 
    him by al-Bukhaari. Hishaam narrated from his father ‘Urwah that they were 
    not commanded to make it up, and ‘Urwah was more knowledgeable than his 
    son.” End quote.

     If you want to be on the safe side and make up a day in its 
    place, then you are doing well. Making up one day is a simple matter, praise 
    be to Allaah, and there is no sin on you for what happened.

66176,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66176,Is the person who sights the new moon of Ramadaan on his own obliged to fast?,"A man saw the new moon of Ramadaan on his own – is he obliged to fast? If that is the case, is there any evidence?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If a man saw 
    the new moon of Ramadaan on his own, or he saw the new moon of Shawwaal on 
    his own, and he told the qaadi or the people of the city but they did not 
    accept his testimony, should he fast on his own or should he only fast with 
    the people? There are three scholarly points of view: 
1 – He 
    should act upon his own sighting in both cases, so he should fast from the 
    beginning of the month and break the fast at the end on his own. This is the 
    view of Imam al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him). 
But he 
    should do that secretly so that he does not show openly that he is doing 
    something different than the people and so that this will not lead to them 
    thinking badly of him or regarding him as a fast-breaker when they are 
    fasting. 
2 – He 
    should act upon his own sighting at the beginning of the month and fast on 
    his own, but at the end of the month he should not act upon his own 
    sighting, rather he should break the fast when the people do. 
This is the 
    view of the majority of scholars, including Abu Haneefah, Maalik and Ahmad 
    (may Allaah have mercy on them). 
This view 
    was also favoured by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    who said: This is in order to be on the safe side, so that we may be on the 
    safe side with regard to starting and ending the fast. With regard to 
    fasting, we say to him: fast, and with regard to breaking the fast, we say 
    to him: Do not break the fast, rather you should fast. End quote from 
    al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/330. 
3 – He 
    should not act upon his own sighting in either case; rather he should start 
    fasting and stop fasting with the people. 
This was the 
    view of Imam Ahmad in one report, and it was the view favoured by Shaykh 
    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, He quoted a great deal of evidence to support it, and 
    he said: The third view is that he should start and end the fast with the 
    people. This is the most correct 9?) view, because the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Your fast is the day when you 
    fast, and your breaking the fast is the day when you break the fast, and 
    your sacrifice is the day when you offer the sacrifice.” Narrated by 
    al-Tirmidhi, who said it is hasan ghareeb. Also narrated by Abu Dawood, and 
    by Ibn Maajah, who mentioned breaking the fast and the sacrifice only. Also 
    narrated by al-Tirmidhi from the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Ja’far from 
    ‘Uthmaan ibn Muhammad from al-Maqbari from Abu Hurayrah, that the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The fast is the day 
    when you fast, the breaking of the fast is the day when you break the fast, 
    and the sacrifice is the day when you offer the sacrifice.” Al-Tirmidhi 
    said: This is a hasan ghareeb hadeeth. And some scholars interpreted this 
    hadeeth as meaning that one should start and end the fast with the community 
    and the majority of the people. End quote from Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 
    25/114. 
He also 
    quoted as evidence the fact that even if he sighted the new moon of 
    Dhu’l-Hijjah on his own, none of the scholars suggested that he should 
    observe the standing at ‘Arafah on his own. 
He said that 
    the basic principle concerning this matter is that the ruling is connected 
    to the new moon of the month. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They ask 
    you (O Muhammad) about the new moons [ahillah]. Say: These are signs to mark 
    fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage”

    [al-Baqarah 2:189]
Hilal (pl. 
    ahillah) in Arabic refers to when something is announced and everyone knows 
    about it. If the hilal shows in the sky but people did not recognize it and 
    announce its sighting, then it is not a hilal. 
Similarly 
    the word shahr (month) is taken from the word shuhrah (fame); if it is not 
    well known among the people then the month has not begun. Many people make a 
    mistake with regard to this matter and think that when the moon appears in 
    the sky, that night is the  first of the month, whether it appears to the 
    people and they announce it or not. But that is not the case, rather it has 
    to appear to the people and they have to announce the beginning of the month 
    when they see it. Hence the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “Your fast is the day when you fast, and your breaking the 
    fast is the day when you break the fast, and your sacrifice is the day when 
    you offer the sacrifice” i.e., this day on which you announce the beginning 
    or end of the fast or the sacrifice. If you do not recognize it, then no 
    ruling can be based on that. End quote from Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 
    25/202. 
This view 
    was expressed in a fatwa issued by Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him).

66193,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66193,Ruling on fasting the days of al-tashreeq,A man fasted on the eleventh and twelfth of Dhu’l-Hijjah. What is the ruling on his fast?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth of Dhu’l-Hijjah are known as the days of al-Tashreeq. It is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade fasting on these days, and he did not give any concession allowing fasting on these days except to those pilgrims doing tamattu’ or qiraan who could not find an animal to sacrifice. 
Muslim (1141) narrated that Nubayshah al-Hudhali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The days of al-Tashreeq are the days of eating, drinking and remembering Allah.” 
Ahmad (16081) narrated from Hamzah ibn ‘Amr al-Aslami (may Allah be pleased with him) that he saw a man on a camel following the people in Mina, and the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was present, and the man was saying, “Do not fast on these days for they are the days of eating and drinking.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 7355. 
Ahmad (17314) and Abu Dawood (2418) narrated from Abu Murrah the freed slave of Umm Haani’ that he entered with ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr upon his father ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas. He offered them food and said, “Eat.” He said: “I am fasting.” ‘Amr said: “Eat, for these are the days on which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us not to fast, and he forbade fasting on these days.” Maalik said: “Those are the days of al-Tashreeq.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
Ahmad (1459) narrated that Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded me to call out on the days of Mina: “These are the days of eating and drinking, and there is no fasting on these days,” meaning the days of al-Tashreeq. The editor of the Musnad said it is saheeh li ghayrihi. 
Al-Bukhari (1998) narrated that ‘Aa’ishah and Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) said: “No concession was granted allowing anyone to fast on the days of al-Tashreeq, except for the (pilgrim) who could not find a sacrificial animal.” 
These ahaadeeth and others indicate that it is forbidden to fast on the days of al-Tashreeq. 
Hence most of the scholars are of the view that it is not valid to observe voluntary fasts on these days. 
But if one is fasting to make up a missed Ramadan fast, some of the scholars are of the view that that is permissible, but the correct view is that it is not permissible. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (3/51): 
It is not permissible to observe a voluntary fast on these days, according to the majority of scholars. It was narrated from Ibn al-Zubayr that he used to fast on these days, and something similar was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar and al-Aswad ibn Yazeed. It was narrated from Abu Talhah that he used not to break his fast except on the two Eid days. It seems that these people had not heard that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade fasting on these days, and if they had heard of that, they would not have done that again. 
As for observing an obligatory fast on those days, there are two views. One is that it is not permitted, because it is forbidden to fast on those days, and they are likened to the day of Eid.  
The other view is that an obligatory fast observed on those days is valid, because it was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar and ‘Aa’ishah said: “No concession was granted allowing anyone to fast on the days of al-Tashreeq, except for the (pilgrim) who could not find a sacrificial animal” – i.e., for pilgrims doing tamattu’ if they cannot find a sacrificial animal. This is a saheeh hadeeth which was narrated by al-Bukhari and is applied by analogy to all obligatory fasts. End quote. 
The view adopted by the Hanbali madhhab is that fasts observed on these days to make up for missed Ramadan fasts are not valid. 
See Kashshaaf al-Qinaa’, 2/342 
With regard to pilgrims doing qiraan and tamattu’ on these days if they cannot find a sacrificial animal, the evidence for that is the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah and Ibn ‘Umar quoted above. This is the also the view of the Maalikis, Hanbalis and the older Shaafa’i madhhab. 
The Hanafis and Shaafa’is are of the view that it is not permissible to fast on these days. 
See al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 7/323 
The most correct view is the first view, which is that it is permissible to fast on these days for the (pilgrim) who cannot find a sacrificial animal. 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (6/486): 
It should be noted that the more correct view according to our companions is the later view that it is not valid to fast on these days at all, either for the pilgrim doing tamattu’ or for anyone else. The most correct view based on the evidence is that it is valid for the pilgrim doing tamattu’ and it is permissible for him, because the hadeeth which grants this concession is saheeh as we have explained, and it clearly states that so it cannot be ignored.” End quote. 
To sum up: it is not valid to fast on the days of al-Tashreeq, whether that is a voluntary fast or an obligatory fast, except for pilgrims doing tamattu’ or qiraan, if they cannot find a sacrificial animal. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is not permissible to fast on the thirteenth of Dhu’l-Hijjah, whether that is a voluntary fast or an obligatory fast, because these are the days of eating and drinking and remembering Allah.  The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade fasting on these days and did not grant a concession to anyone except for pilgrims doing tamattu’ who could not find a sacrificial animal. 
Majmoo’ Fatawa Ibn Baz (15/381) 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
The days of al-Tashreeq are the three days after Eid al-Adha. They are called the days of al-Tashreeq because the people used to dry (yusharriqoon) the meat in the sun so that it would not turn rotten when they stored it. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said concerning these three days: “The days of al-Tashreeq are the days of eating, drinking and remembering Allah.” As that is the case, i.e., their prescribed purpose in sharee’ah is for eating and drinking and remembering Allah, then this is not a time for fasting. Hence Ibn ‘Umar and ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with them) said: “No concession was granted allowing anyone to fast on the days of al-Tashreeq, except for the (pilgrim) who could not find a sacrificial animal” – i.e., those pilgrims who are doing tamattu’ and qiraan; they should fast for three days during Hajj and seven days when they go back home. If the pilgrim doing qiraan or tamattu’ cannot find a sacrificial animal, it is permissible for him to fast on these three days, so that the Hajj season will not end before he can fast them. Apart from that, it is not permissible to fast on these days; even if a person is obliged to fast two consecutive months, he must break his fast on the day of Eid and the three days after that, then he must resume his fast. End quote. 
Majmoo’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 20/question no. 419 
Based on the above, whoever fasted on the days of al-Tashreeq, all or some of them, and was not a pilgrim doing tamattu or qiraan who could not find a sacrificial animal, must ask Allah for forgiveness for doing something that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade. If he fasted on those days to make up for missed Ramadan fasts, that does not count and he must make it up again.
