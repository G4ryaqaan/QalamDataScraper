I am facing a dilemma regarding the permissibility of contraveption in Islam. I have read your answers and material from other sources and alhamdullilah it is very informative but unfortunately limited to contraceptive measures such as condoms, coils etc. As a pharmacist I will be faced with supplying patients with oral contraceptives such as the pill and especially the 'morning after pill'. I cannot find the Islamic perspective on the last two contraceptive measures and especially the latter. I may be mistaken, but does it say in the Qur'an somewhere that Allah (SWT) enters the soul into the foetus after a particular period of time? If so, please could you give me an answer in light of this since many muslims condemn the use of the 'morning after pill' on the basis that it kills a living human being. Some muslims also condemn the use of oral contraceptives/'morning after pill' on the basis that these drugs cause side-effects which may be harmful to the woman taking these but they fail to realise that EVERY drug has the potential to cause side-effects. Please could you give me an answer in light of the views expressed so that I can educate myself and other muslims.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We advise you not to sell them if you

10102,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10102,Cursing One’s Children or Wife,What is the ruling on one who curses his wife or one of his children? Does cursing one’s wife count as divorce or not?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    
    Cursing one’s wife is not permitted, and it is not a divorce; she still 
    remains married to him and he has to repent to Allah for it and seek the 
    forgiveness of the one whom he has cursed.  Similarly, it is not permitted 
    for him to curse his children or anyone else among the Muslims, because the 
    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Trading insults 
    with a Muslim is evildoing and fighting him is kufr (disbelief).” (authentic 
    – agreed upon). And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 
    “Cursing a believer is like killing him.” (al-Bukhari in his Saheeh). 
    

    
    These two saheeh hadeeths (authentic narrations) indicate that a Muslim’s 
    cursing his brother is a major sin, so we must beware of it and restrain our 
    tongues from committing this awful sin.  

    
    A woman is not divorced if her husband curses her; she is still married to 
    her husband, as stated above.","Kitab Majmoo’ Fatawa wa Maqalat Mutanawwi’ah li al-Shaykh ibn Baz (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 8, p. 398"

Bible prophecies about the  advent of Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him)
Abraham is widely regarded  as the Patriarch of monotheism and the common father of the Jews, Christians and Muslims. Through his second son, Isaac, came all Israelite prophets, including such towering figures as Jacob, Joseph, Moses, David, Solomon and Jesus. May peace and blessing be upon them all. The advent of these great prophets was in partial fulfillment of God’s promises to bless the nations of earth through the descendents of Abraham (Genesis 12:2-3). Such fulfillment is wholeheartedly accepted by Muslims whose faith considers the belief in and respect of all prophets an article of faith. 
BLESSING OF ISHMAEL AND ISAAC 
Was the first born son of Abraham (Ishmael) and his descendants icluded in God’s covenant and promise? A few verses from the Bible may help shed some light on this question : 


Genesis 12:2-3 speaks of God’s promise to Abraham and his descendants before any child was born to him.


Genesis 17:4 reiterates God’s promise after the birth of Ishmael and before the birth of Isaac.


In Genesis, ch.21. Isaac is specifically blessed but Ishmael was also specifically blessed and promised by God to become “a great nation” especially in Genesis 21:13, 18.


According to Deuteronomy 21:15-17 the traditional rights and privileges of the first born son are not to be affected by the social status of his mother (being a ‘free’ woman such as Sarah, Isaac’s mother, or a “Bondwoman” such as Hagar, Ishmael’s mother). This is only consistent with the moral and humanitarian principles of all revealed faiths.


The full legitimacy of Ismael as Abraham’s son and “seed” and the full legitimacy of his mother, Hagar, as Abraham’s wife are clearly stated in Genesis 21:13 and 16:3.


 After Jesus, the last Israelite messenger and prophet, it was time that God’s promise to bless Ismael and his descendants be fulfilled. Less than 600 years after Jesus, came the last messenger of God, Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) , from the progency of Abraham through Ishmael. God’s blessing of both of the main branches of Abraham’s family tree was now fulfilled. But are there additional corroborating evidences that the Bible did in fact foretell the advent of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him)?
 MUHAMMAD (peace and blessings be upon him):
The Prophet Like Unto Moses
 A long time after Abraham, God’s promise to send the long-awaited Messenger was repeated, this time in Moses’ word.
 In Deuteronomy 18:18, Moses spoke of the prophet to be sent by God who is :


From among the Israelite’s “brethren” a reference to their Ishmaelite cousins as Ishmael was the other son of Abraham who was explicitly promised to become a “great nation”.


A prophet like unto Moses. There were hardly any two prophets who were so much alike as Moses and Muhammad. Both were given a comprehensive law code of life, both encountered their enemies and were victors in miraculous ways, both were accepted as prophets/statesmen and both migrated following conspiracies to assassinate them. Analogies between Moses and Jesus overlook not only the above similarities but other crucial ones as well (e.g. the natural birth, family life and death of Moses and Muhammad but not of Jesus, who was regarded by His followers as the Son of God and not exclusively a messenger of God, as Moses and Muhammad were and as Muslim belief Jesus was).


 THE AWAITED PROPHET WAS TO COME FROM ARABIA
 Deuteronomy 33:1-2 combines references to Moses, Jesus and Muhammad. It speaks of God (i.e. God’s revelation) coming from Sinai, rising from Seir (probably the village of Sa’ir near Jerusalem) and shining forth from Paran.
According to Genesis 21:21, the wilder-ness of Paran was the place where Ishmael settled (i.e. Arabia, specifically Mecca). 
Indeed the King James version of the Bible mentions the pilgrims passing through the valley of Ba’ca (another name of Mecca) in Psalms 84:4-6. 
Isaiah 42:1-13 speaks of the beloved of God. His elect and messenger who will bring down a law to be awaited in the isles and who “shall not fail nor be discouraged till he have set judgement on earth.” Verse 11, connects that awaited one with the descendants of Ke’dar. Who is Ke’dar? According to Genesis 25:13, Ke’dar was the second son of Ishmael, the ancestor of the prophet Muhammad. 
MUHAMMAD’S MIGRATION FROM MECCA TO MEDINA : PROPHECIED IN THE BIBLE? 
Habakkuk 3:3 speaks of God (God’s help) coming from Te’man (an Oasis North of Medina according to J. Hasting’s Dictionary of the Bible), and the holy one (coming) from Paran. That holy one who under persecution migrated from Paran (Mecca) to be received enthusiastically in Medina  was none but Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him). 
Indeed the incident of the migration of the Prophet and his persecuted followers is vividly described in Isaiah 21:13-17. that section forerold as well about the battel of Badr in which the few ill-armed faithfull miraculously defeated the “mighty” men of Ke’dar, who sought to destroy Islam and intimidate their own folks who turned to Islam. 
THE QURAN (KORAN) FORETOLD IN THE BIBLE? 
For twenty-three years, God’s words (the Quran) were truly put into Muhammad’s mouth. He was not the “author” of the Quran. The Quran was dictated to him by Angel Gabriel who asked Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) to simply repeat the words of the Quran as he heard them. These words were then committed to memory and to writing by those who heard them during Muhammad’s life time and under his supervision. 
Was it a coincidence that the Prophet “like unto Moses” from the “brethren” of the Israelites (i.e. from the Ishmaelites) was also described as one in whose mouth God will put His words and that he will speak in the name of God., (Duteronomy 18:18-20). Was it also a coincidence that the “Paraclete” that Jesus foretold to come after Him was described as one who “shall not speak of himself, but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak.. “(John 16:13). 
Was it another coincidence that Isaiah ties between the Messenger connected with Ke’dar and a new song (a scripture in a new language) to be sung unto the Lord (Isaiah 42:10-11). More explicitly, prophesies Isaiah “ for with stammering lips, and another tongue, will he speak to this people” (Isaiah 28:11). This latter verse correctly describes the “stammering lips” of Prophet Muhammad reflecting the state of tension and concentration he went through at the time of revelation. Another related point is that the Quran was revealed in piece-meal over a span of twenty-three years. It is interisting to compare this with Isaiah 28:10 which speaks of the same thing. 
THAT PROPHET – PARACLETE – MUHAMMAD 
Up to the time of Jesus, the Israelites were still awaiting that Prophet like unto Moses prophecied in Deuteronomy 18:18. When John the Baptist came, they asked him if he was Christ and he said “No”. They asked him if he was Elias and he said “No”. Then, in apparent reference to Deuteronomy 18:18, they asked him “Art thou that Prophet” and he answered, “No”. (John 1:19-21). 
In the Gospel according to John (Chapters 14, 15, 16) Jesus spoke of the “ Paraclete” or comporter who will come after him, who will be sent by Father as another Paraclete, who will teach new things which the contemporaries of Jesus could not bear. While the Paraclete is described as the spirit of truth (whose meaning resemble Muhammad’s famous title Al-Amin, the trustworthy), he is identified in one verse as the Holy Ghost (John 14:26). Such a designation is however incosistent with the profile of that Paraclete. In the words of the Dictionary of the Bible, (Ed. J. Mackenzie) “These items, it must be admitted do not give an entirely coherent picture.” 
Indeed history tells us that many early Christians understood the Paraclete to be a man and not a spirit. This might explain the followings who responded to some who claimed, without meeting the criteria stipulated by Jesus, to be the awaited “Paraclete”. 
It was Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) who was the Paraclete, Comforter, helper, admonisher sent by God after Jesus. He testified of Jesus, taught new things which could not be borne at Jesus’ time, he spoke what he heard (revelation), he dwells with the believers (through his well-preserved teachings). Such teachings will remain forever because he was the last messenger of God, the only Universal Messenger to unite the whole of humanity under God and on the path of PRESERVED truth. He told of many things to come which “came to pass” in the minutest detail, meeting the criterion given by Moses to distinguish between the true prophet and the false prophets (Deuteronomy 18:22). He did reprove the world of sin, of righteousness and of judgement (John 16:8-11). 
WAS THE SHIFT OF RELIGIUS LEADERSHIP PROPHECIED? 
Following the rejection of the last Israelite prophet, Jesus, it was about time that God’s promise to make Ishmael a great nation be fulfilled (Genesis 21:13, 18). 
In Matthew 21:19-21, Jesus spoke of the fruitless fig tree (a Biblical symbol of prophetic heritage) to be cleared after being given a last chance of three years (the duration of Jesus’ ministry) to give fruit. In a later verse in the same chapter, Jesus said : “Therefore, say I unto you, the Kingdom of God shall be taken away from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruit thereof” (Matthew 21:43). That nation of Ishmael’s descendants (the rejected stone in Matthew 21 :42) which was victorious against all super-powers of its time as prophecied by Jesus : “And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken, but  on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder” (Matthew 21:44). 
OUT OF CONTEXT COINCIDENCE? 
Is it possible that the numerous prophecies cited here are all individually and combined out of context misinterpretations? Is the opposite true, that such infrequently studied verses fit together consistently and clearly point to the advent of the man who changed the course of human history, Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him). Is it reasonable to conclude that all these prophecies, appearing in different books of the Bible and spoken by various prophets at different times were all coinsidence? If this is so, here is another strange “coincidence”! 
One of the signs of the Prophet to come from Paran (Mecca) is that he will come with “ten thousands of saints” (Deuteronomy 33:2 KJV). That was the number of faithful who accompanied Prophet Muhammad to Paran (Mecca) in his victorious, bloodless return to his birthplace, to destroy the remaining symbols of idolatry in the Ka’bah. 
Says God as quoted by Moses : 
          And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him. (Deuteronomy 18:19).

And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [3:31]. 
Abu Huraira (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘if Allah loves a person, He calls Jibrael saying, ’Allah loves so and so; O Jibrael love him.’ And make an announcement amongst the inhabitants of the heaven: “Allah loves so and so therefore you should love him also, and so all the inhabitants of the heaven would love him, and then he is granted the pleasures of the people on the earth.” [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]. 
Abu Huraira (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that Allah’s Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that Allah said: “I will declare war against him who shows hostility to a pious worshipper of mine. And the most beloved things with which My slave comes nearer to Me, is what I have enjoined upon him; and My worshipper keeps on coming close to Me through performing Nawafil (praying or doing extra deeds besides what is obligatory) till I love him, then I become his sense of hearing with which he hears, and his sense of sight with which he sees, and his hands with which he grips, and his legs with which he walks; and if he asks Me, I will give him, and if he asks My protection (refuge), I will protect him.” [Al-Bukhari]. 
A-The Excellence of Reciting the Quran
 1.     Abu Umamah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that he heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saying: “Read the Quran (regularly) for it will act as an intercessor for its readers on the Day of Resurrection.” [ Muslim].
2.     Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best among you (Muslims) are those who learn the Quran and teach it (to others).” [Al-Bukhari].
3.     ‘Abdullah bin Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said : “When somebody recites one letter from the Quran he will get one good deed in recompense which will be equal to ten good deeds. I do not say that Alif Lam Meem is a letter, but Alif is a letter, Lam is a letter and Meem is a letter (i.e it is equal to three letters).” [ At-Tirmithi]. 
B-The Excellence of remembering Allah 
1.      Abu Huraira (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said : “A person who recites after every salah (prayer) : sub-han- Allah (glory be to Allah) thirty three times, Al-ham-do lil-lah (all praise belongs to Allah) thirty three times and Al-la-ho Akbar (Allah is great) thirty three times, and completes the figure of hundred with the recitation of La ilaha ila Allah wahdahu lasharikalahu lahu almulku walahu alhamdu wahuwa ‘ala kul shai in qadeer
(“None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and He has no partner, for Him is the kingdom and all the praises and thanks are for Him and he is Omnipotent”) will have his (minor) sins forgiven, although they may be as much as the foam of the sea. [ Muslim]. 
2.      Abu Huraira (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that Allah’s Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Who-ever says ‘Subhan Allahi wa bihamdi hi’, one hundred times a day, will be forgiven all his sins even if they were as much as the foam of the sea.” [ Al-Bukhari and Muslim].

C-Invoking Allah’s Blessings Upon the Prophet 
1.      Almighty Allah said (what means): “Allah and His Angels send blessing on the Prophet, O you who believe! send your (salah) and salute (greet) on him with a worthy salutation.” 33:56.

And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
10119,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10119,Saying “Sadaqa Allaah al-‘Azeem”,"I often hear that saying “Sadaqa Allaah al-‘Azeem (Allaah Almighty has spoken the truth)” after reading Qur’aan is bid’ah. Some people told me that it is permissible and they quoted as evidence the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Say (O Muhammad): “Allaah has spoken the truth; follow the religion of Ibraaheem (Abraham) Haneefa (Islamic Monotheism, i.e. he used to worship Allaah Alone)” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:95] 

Some educated people told me that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted to stop someone who was reading Qur’aan he said, “Enough” and he did not say “Sadaqa Allaahu al-‘Azeem.” My question is: is it permissible to say “Sadaqa Allaahu al-‘Azeem” when one stops reading Qur’aan? Could you please explain this to me?",,,"Praise be to Allah.I do not know of any basis for the people’s habit of saying 
          “Sadaqa Allaahu al-‘Azeem” when they finish reading Qur’aan, 
          so it should not be taken as a habit. Indeed, according to the principles 
          of sharee’ah it is more like bid’ah, if anyone believes that it is Sunnah. 
          So this should not be done and should not be taken as a habit.  
          
With regard to the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
          
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘Allaah has spoken the truth…’”[Aal ‘Imraan 
          3:95] – 
This is not speaking about this matter. Rather Allaah 
          was commanding him to explain to the people that Allaah had spoken the 
          truth in what He had said in His Books, the Tawraat, etc., and that 
          He had spoken the Truth in all that He had said to His slaves in the 
          Tawraat, the Injeel and all other revealed Books.  
And He was speaking the truth in all that He said to His 
          slaves in His Book the Qur’aan. But this is not evidence that it is 
          mustahabb to say “Sadaqa Allaah al-‘Azeem” after reading the 
          Qur’aan or after reading some aayahs or a soorah. This was not reported 
          or known from the Prophet  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or his companions (may Allaah be 
          pleased with them). When Ibn Mas’ood recited to the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) from the beginning of Soorat 
          al-Nisaa’ until he reached the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
          
“How (will it be) then, when We bring from each nation a witness 
          and We bring you (O Muhammad) as a witness against these people?”[al-Nisaa’ 
          4:41] – 
the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) said to him, “Enough.” Ibn Mas’ood said: “I turned 
          to him and saw that his eyes were filled with tears”, i.e., he was weeping 
          because of the mention of this great status on the Day of Resurrection 
          which is mentioned in this aayah, where Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning): “How (will it be) then, when We bring from each 
          nation a witness and We bring you” – O Muhammad – “as a witness 
          against these people?” – i.e., against his ummah.  
          
The point is that there is no basis in sharee’ah for adding 
          these words – “sadaqa Allaah al-‘Azeem” – when finishing reading 
          Qur’aan. What is prescribed is not to do this, in accordance with the 
          example of the Prophet  (peace and 
          blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions (may Allaah be pleased 
          with them). But if a person does that sometimes, without intending to, 
          it doesn’t matter, for Allaah speaks the truth in all matters, may He 
          be glorified and exalted. But making that a habit every time one reads 
          Qur’aan, as many people do nowadays, has no basis, as stated above.","Kitaab Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 9, p. 342 ."

10124,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10124,Is it possible to seek knowledge by using tapes?,Some seekers of knowledge content themselves with listening to tapes of the scholars giving their lessons. Is this sufficient for gaining knowledge? Can they be considered to be seekers of knowledge? Will that affect their belief?,,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          Undoubtedly these tapes spare them the need to be present 
          with the scholars if they cannot be present, but being present with 
          the scholars is preferable, and is better for the purpose of understanding 
          and discussing. But if they cannot be present then this is good enough. 
 
          But can they be seekers of knowledge when they are restricted 
          to this? 
 
          We say, yes, that is possible if a person strives hard, 
          just as it is possible for man to become a scholar by taking knowledge 
          from books. But the difference between taking knowledge from books and 
          tapes, and learning directly from the scholars, is that learning directly 
          from the scholars is a more effective way of gaining knowledge, because 
          it is an easy way which enables one to discuss matters, unlike listening 
          or reading, which needs a great deal of care in order to gather and 
          gain knowledge. 
 
          With regard to the question, will limiting oneself to 
          tapes have any effect on their belief? 
 Our 
          response is: yes, it will have an effect on their belief if they listen 
          to tapes of bid’ah and follow them. But if they listen to tapes of trustworthy 
          scholars, that will not have any effect on their belief, rather it will 
          increase them in faith and steadfastness, and in following the correct 
          belief.","From: Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, Kitaab al-‘Ilm, p. 219"
10125,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10125,What Is the Time of ‘Isha Prayer?,"This question is in reference to the timings of ‘Isha Prayer. There are various opinions regarding when the time for offering ‘Isha prayer expires. Some say that one can pray ‘Isha till the Fajr Adhan is called, while others say that it expires at the time of ""Tahajjud prayers"". And finally some believe that we are supposed to take the number of hours between ‘Isha Adhan and the Fajr Adhan, and divide them into half, in order to estimate the last time for Isha prayer.
I know that prayers should be offered promptly and on time. Delaying a prayer without reason is not encouraged, but still it would be very beneficial to know the exact opinion on this issue.","‘Isha prayer must be performed before midnight, and it is not permissible to delay it until midnight.","When should the ‘Isha prayer be performed?


The best time to offer ‘Isha","Praise be to Allah.When should the ‘Isha prayer be performed?
The ‘Isha prayer must be performed before midnight, and it is not permissible to delay it until midnight. This is because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The time of ‘Isha is until midnight” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Masaajid wa Mawadi’ al-Salah, 964). 
So you have to pray ‘Isha before midnight, based on the length of the night, because the night may be longer or shorter, so the guideline is how many hours the night lasts. If the night is ten hours long, then it is not permissible to delay it until the end of the fifth hour. 
The best time to offer ‘Isha
The best way is to pray it in the first third of the night. If a person prays it at the beginning of the time for ‘Isha, that is OK, but if he delays it a little while, that is preferable, because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to recommend delaying ‘Isha’ prayer for a little while. But if someone prays it at the beginning of its time, after the twilight – the reddish afterglow along the horizon – has vanished, there is nothing wrong with that.
And Allah knows best.","Majmoo’ah Fataawa al-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, 10/386"
10127,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10127,Why will a person who is born into a kaafir family and dies as a kaafir be punished?,"We as Muslims, beleive in destiny and fate, so if it was written in the fate of an infant to be born in a non-beleivers family, Why would that indiviual go to hell when he grows up and dies ?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, we believe in al-qadaa’ wa’l-qadar (divine decree), but first and foremost we believe in the perfection and justice of Allaah, and that He is far above being unjust towards His slaves in the slightest. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Truly, Allaah wrongs not mankind in aught; but mankind wrong themselves”
[Yoonus 10:44]. 
And there are many similar, well known verses.  
Above all, we know that Allaah is Kind and loves kindness in all things; He is Most Gracious, Most Merciful, the Bestower of vast mercy that is greater than His wrath and vengeance, as it says in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah wrote a decree before He created the universe (saying); My mercy prevails over My wrath, and it is written with Him above the Throne.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (7554). 
Because of that, He has to allow His slaves a respite and be patient with them. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “… there is no one to whom warnings are more than Allaah, and because of that He sent (the Prophets) with glad tidings and warnings.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (7416). 
Once this wise principle is established in your mind, without which no one’s faith is sound, then you may refer to it for every matter of confusion that is caused by ignorance or specious arguments, and you will find that your mind will be quickly put at ease. You know that Allaah is more merciful towards you and all His slaves than a mother to her child. It was narrated from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) that some prisoners were brought to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and there was a woman among the prisoners who was searching for someone. When she found a small boy among the prisoners, she clasped him to her and started to breastfeed him. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to us: “Do you think that this woman would throw her child into the fire?” We said: No, by Allaah, she would never do that if she is able not to. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah is more merciful towards His slaves than this woman is towards her child.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5999) and Muslim (2754). Allaah, the Most Gracious, Most Merciful, is more merciful towards that person who you are asking about and arguing about than you or he himself. If he deserves the mercy of Allaah, then the mercy of Allaah will undoubtedly encompass him, but if he is one of the stubborn then you had better focus on what is good for you and what may save you. 
… “so be not a pleader for the treacherous” [al-Nisa’ 4:105]. 
Beware of neglecting this principle even for a moment, then beware of arguing about the divine decree before you understand it. You should understand that the divine decree is like the sun; when you believe in it and surrender to it, on the basis of Qur’aan and Sunnah, then your mind will be at ease, like the one who walks in the daylight. 
But if you examine it too closely and look too deeply, what does the one who stares at the disk of the sun gain except damage to his eyes? 
If we look at what you have asked about, so that you will not think that what we have said above is a way to avoid the question, you should note that Allaah has given every man the potential to distinguish good from bad (interpretation of the meaning). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):                                        
“Have We not made for him two eyes?”
[al-Balad 90:8] i.e., two eyes with which to see; 
“And a tongue and two lips”
[al-Balad 90:9], i.e., a tongue with which to speak that which is in his heart, and lips with which to speak. 
“And shown him the two ways”
[al-Balad 90:10] – Ibn Mas’ood said: i.e., good and evil. 
And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, We have created man from Nutfah (drops) of mixed semen (sexual discharge of man and woman), in order to try him, so We made him hearer and seer.
3. Verily, We showed him the way, whether he be grateful or ungrateful”
[Al-Insaan 76:2-3]
From the above verses it is clear that Allaah has given man the means and tools to find out the ways of good and evil. 
Moreover, Allaah has not given these tools only in order to judge people against them; rather He sent them warnings and gave them clear guidance in the Revelation that came to them from heaven. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that mankind should have no plea against Allaah after the (coming of) Messengers”
[al-Nisa’ 4:165] 
“And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning)”
[al-Isra’ 17:15]. 
Because of that, Allaah rebukes the kuffaar for not heeding the warnings and guidance that Allaah sent to them, and for ignoring His Messengers and proof. He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“’O you assembly of jinn and Mankind! Did not there come to you Messengers from amongst you, reciting unto you My Verses and warning you of the Meeting of this Day of yours’  They will say: ‘We bear witness against ourselves’  It was the life of this world that deceived them. And they will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers.
131. This is because your Lord would not destroy the (populations of) towns for their wrongdoing (i.e. associating others in worship along with Allaah) while their people were unaware (so the Messengers were sent)”
[al-An’aam 6:130-131]
As for the one who followed his father in kufr, and died a kaafir, Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
A distinction is made between the one who imitated his forefathers even though he know the truth, and one who imitated his forefathers and had no way of knowing the truth. The two categories do exist, so the one who knew the truth and turned away from it is negligent and has no excuse before Allaah. As for the ones who were unable to ask and learn, and had no way of knowing the truth, they also fall into two categories: 
1-Those who wanted guidance and sought it but were unable to find it because there was no one to guide them. They come under the same ruling as those who lived in the intervals between Prophets and those whom the call did not reach.
2-Those who did not care and did not seek the truth and it never occurred to them to follow a way other than that which they were following.
The former says: O Lord, if I knew a religion that is better than that which I am following, I would follow it and leave that which I am following; but the latter is content with that which he is following, and would not prefer anything else or seek any other way. It makes no difference whether they were able to do that or not, as both of them are incapable. The former are like those who sought the true religion during the intervals between Prophets but did not find it, so they turned away from it after exhaustive efforts to find out, out of inability and ignorance; whereas the latter are like those who never sought it, rather they died in shirk. End quote. Tareeq al-Hijratayn, 678.
 Even if he sought it he would be unable to find it, and there is a difference between the inability of the seeker and the inability of the one who does not care. Think about this point. Allaah will judge between His slaves on the Day of Resurrection by His wisdom and justice, and He will not punish anyone but those against whom proof is established by means of the Messengers. This case is clear and definite. As for whether proof is established against a specific person, or not, this is something concerning which no one can intervene between Allaah and His slaves. This comes under the rulings on reward and punishment. As for the rulings in this world, it is to be dealt with as it appears to be; the children and insane of the kuffaar are kaafirs according to worldly rulings, and they come under the same rulings as their guardian. 
With regard to those whom the call of Islam did not reach, and against whom no proof was established by means of the Messengers, according to the more correct view, they will be tested on the Day of Resurrection. A Messenger will be sent to them there, and those who obey him will enter Paradise and those who disobey him will enter Hell, as it says in Musnad al-Imam Ahmad (18566) and elsewhere from the hadeeth of al-Aswad ibn Zaree’ that the Prophet of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There will be four on the Day of Resurrection: a deaf man who could not hear anything, an imbecile, a senile old man and a man who died during the interval between two Prophets. As for the deaf man, he will say: ‘Lord, Islam came but I did not hear anything.’ As for the imbecile, he will say: ‘Islam came but the children were throwing dung at me.’ As for the senile old man, he will say, ‘Lord, Islam came but I did not understand anything.’ As for the one who died during the interval between two Prophets, he will say: ‘Lord, no Messenger of Yours came to me.’ They will give their pledge to obey Him, then a Messenger will be sent to tell them to enter the fire.” He said:  “By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, if they enter it, it will be cool and safe for them.” According to another report: “The one who enters it, it will be cool and safe for him, and the one who does not enter it will be dragged to it.” Narrated by Ahmad.

Is it correct to say this?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Ibn Katheer said in his Tafseer (3/517):

    This phrase is used a great deal by scribes who are transcribing books in 
    which the phrase “ ‘alayhi al-salaam (upon him be peace) is used in 
    reference to ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him), to the exclusion of 
    other Sahaabah, or the words “karrama Allaahu wajhahu (may Allaah 
    honour his face)” are used. Although the meaning is acceptable, we should 
    respect all the Sahaabah equally in this way, because this is a kind of 
    veneration and honouring, and the two shaykhs [Abu Bakr and ‘Umar] and Ameer 
    al-Mu’mineen ‘Uthmaan are more deserving of that – may Allaah be pleased 
    with them all.

     The following question was submitted to the Standing 
    Committee (3/289):

     Why are the words “karrama Allaahu wajhahu (may 
    Allaah honour his face)” said after mentioning the name of ‘Ali ibn Abi 
    Taalib?

     They answered: 

    Saying the words “karrama Allaahu wajhahu (may Allaah 
    honour his face)” after mentioning the name of ‘Ali and singling him out in 
    this manner is one aspect of the way in which the Shi’ah exaggerate about 
    him. It was said that this is because he never looked at the ‘awrah of any 
    person at all, or because he never prostrated to an idol. But this is not 
    something that is unique to him, as other Sahaabah who were born in Islam 
    also shared these characteristics.

     Some of them said that the words “karrama Allaahu wajhahu 
    (may Allaah honour his face)” are only said in reference to ‘Ali because he 
    never prostrated to any idol.

     I say: because the Raafidis, the enemies of ‘Ali and the 
    enemies of the family of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) use this phrase, we should avoid imitating the people 
    of bid’ah (innovation). And Allaah knows best. 

    They have reasons for doing that which do not justify 
    singling out ‘Ali for this phrase, such as the fact that he never looked at 
    the ‘awrah of another person, or that he never prostrated to any idol. But 
    those Sahaabah who were born in Islam also share these chracateristics. It 
    should also be noted that when giving any reason it is also essential to 
    offer evidence and proof.

     Note:

     In Musnad Ahmad it is narrated that Abu Sa’eed 
    al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) took the banner and waved 
    it, then said, ‘Who can take this and give it its due.’ So and so came and 
    said, ‘I will,’ but he said to him, ‘Keep away.’ Then another man came and 
    he said, Keep away.’ Then the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: ‘By the One Who honoured the face of Muhammad, I shall 
    certainly give it to a man who will never flee. Take it, O ‘Ali.”

     In the text of some ahaadeeth, you will find their words – “karrama 
    Allaahu wajhahu (may Allaah honour his face)” – when ‘Ali (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) is mentioned, but we do not know of this in any marfoo’ 
    report, and it is not known that any of the Sahaabah said these words in 
    reference to ‘Ali, so these may be the words of the scribe.","Mu’jam al-Manaahi al-Lafziyyah by Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd, p. 454"
10138,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10138,Deception in war,Does Islam permit deception in war? Is this considered to be betrayal and treachery?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah has forbidden treachery and has condemned those who do it. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They are those with whom you made a covenant, but they break their covenant every time and they do not fear Allaah”
[al-Anfaal  8:56]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Every betrayer will have a banner on the Day of Resurrection, by which he will be known.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6966; Muslim, 1736)
 Al-Bukhaari narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: ‘The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘There are four characteristics, whoever has them all is a pure hypocrite: when he speaks, he lies; when he makes a promise he breaks it; when he is entrusted with something he betrays that trust; and when he argues, he speaks in an obscene manner. Whoever has one of these traits has a trait of hypocrisy until he gives it up.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3878; Muslim, 58)
 And it was narrated that Maalik said: “I heard that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas said: ‘There is no people who betrays their covenant but Allaah gives their enemies power over them.” (al-Muwatta’, Baab ma jaa’a fi’l-wafa’ bi’l-‘ahd)
 Yet despite this condemnation of betrayal, Islam allows deception in war in order to attain victory. Al-Nawawi said: “The scholars are agreed that it is permissible to deceive the kuffaar in war in any way possible, except if that would mean breaking the terms of a treaty or trust, in which case it is not permitted.
 The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “War is deceit.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3029; Muslim, 58).  One of the most dangerous elements of deceit is taking the enemy by surprise and catching them unawares before they can get ready to fight. When the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted to head for Makkah in order to conquer it, he ordered the Muslims to get ready without telling anyone of his intention until after they had set out for Makkah, and after taking all precautions to prevent news of that reaching the mushrikeen.
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to send out many raiding parties, and he would tell them to travel by night and conceal themselves by day so that they could catch the enemy unawares.
 Although it is permissible to use deception in war, we say that Islam has attained a high standard of ethics with regard to the use of these tricks in war. Among the most prominent examples of that are the following: 
‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab wrote to the commander of an army that he had sent out: “I have heard that some men among you look for kaafirs, then when they run to hide in difficult mountainous terrain they say, ‘Do not be afraid,’ then when they catch up with them they kill them. By the one in whose hand is my soul, if I hear that anyone has done that I will chop off his head.”
 It was narrated that Abu Muslimah said: “ ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab said: ‘By the One in Whose hand is my soul, if any one of you were to point to the sky [i.e., a gesture to imply that he will not harm him] to make a mushrik come down to him and then kill him, I would kill him for that.’”
 Islam has forbidden treachery, and treachery is not one of the kinds of tricks and deception that are permitted in war.
 This Islamic sharee’ah makes a distinction between the kinds of deceit that are permitted and that which involves treachery and breaks treaties.

    If he has indeed divorced her by khula’, in the sense that 
    the marriage has been annulled and there is nothing left to be done except

    stated that giving birth will cause the mother to become exhausted or ill, 
    or will make her sickness worse, or there is the fear that pregnancy or 
    childbirth will most likely cause the mother to die. In that case it is 
    essential to have the husband’s agreement and consent to prevent or end 
    pregnancy. When this reason is no longer a factor, then the woman should go 
    back to not using contraception. 

    Fatawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah,

    Because losing weight does not reach the degree of necessity 
    mentioned above, it does not come under the same ruling, especially since 
    this operation to tie the tubes requires the female doctor to uncover and 
    touch the ‘awrah. It is even worse if the doctor is male, so this is another 
    reason not to allow it.

    sufficient for the son of Adam to eat a few morsels to keep him alive. But

    You should also follow the permissible means (of preventing 
    pregnancy), such as withdrawal during intercourse (‘azl). The correct 
    scholarly view is that there is nothing wrong with ‘azl even if there is no 
    reason for it, because of the hadeeth of Jabir: “We used to practise ‘azl 
    at the time when the Quran was being revealed.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari,
    al-Nikah, 4808).

10144,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10144,The admission of one spouse to Paradise does not necessarily mean that the other will also be admitted,Is it true that when one spouse enters the paradise he or she will take the other spouse into Jannah also?,,,"Praise be to Allah.If one spouse is admitted to Paradise, that does not necessarily mean that the other will also be admitted. The fate of the wives of Nooh and Loot (peace be upon them) is sufficient to prove that this view is mistaken, because they both went to Hell even though their husbands were Prophets. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah sets forth an example for those who disbelieve: the wife of Nooh (Noah) and the wife of Loot (Lot). They were under two of our righteous slaves, but they both betrayed them (their husbands by rejecting their doctrine). So they [Nooh (Noah) and Loot (Lot)] availed them (their respective wives) not against Allah and it was said: ‘Enter the Fire along with those who enter!’” [al-Tahreem 66:10]
Ibn Katheer said: “Allah says, ‘Allah sets forth an example for those who disbelieve’ meaning, the fact that they may mix with Muslims or live among them will be of no avail to them and will not benefit them before Allah, if faith does not enter their hearts. Then Allah mentions the example and says, ‘the wife of Nooh (Noah) and the wife of Loot (Lot). They were under two of our righteous slaves’ meaning, two Prophets and Messengers; they were with them and in their company night and day, eating with them, being intimate with them, and interacting with them in the closest way; ‘but they both betrayed them’ means, with regard to faith and belief, because they did not share their faith or believe that they were Messengers of Allah. So that did not help them at all and it did not ward off harm from them. Hence Allah says, ‘So they [Nooh (Noah) and Loot (Lot)] availed them (their respective wives) not against Allah’ meaning, because of their kufr. And it was said to both wives, ‘Enter the Fire along with those who enter!’” (Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 4/394).
 But there is the hope that if one of the spouses enters Paradise and is of a higher status than his spouse or children, Allah may cause them to join him.
 Children may benefit from the righteousness of their parents by being raised in status to join them in Paradise, if they enter it. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
 “And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in Faith, —  to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in anything. Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned” [al-Toor 52:21]

10153,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10153,"The Qur’aan was revealed by Allaah, not created",Can you recommend a book in english that explains what it really means that the Qu'ran is not a creation ; and what we should believe in as Muslims?,,,"Praise be to Allah.What we Muslims are obliged to believe is that which has come to us from Allaah, and that which the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has told us. Allaah has told us that He speaks, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And who is truer in statement than Allaah?[al-Nisaa’ 4:87] 
“and whose words can be truer than those of Allaah?
[al-Nisaa’ 4:122] 
These two aayahs offer proof that Allaah speaks, and that His words are true, and there is no kind of lie in them at all. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) when Allaah will say (on the Day of Resurrection): ‘O ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)!…’”
[al-Maa’idah 5:116] 
This aayah shows that Allaah speaks, and that His speech can be heard, so His speech has sound. And His speech includes words and phrases. The evidence that the speech of Allaah is composed of letters is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):  
“O Moosa (Moses)!
Verily, I am your Lord!”[Ta-Ha 20:11] 
because these words are composed of letters, and they are part of the speech of Allaah. And the evidence that the speech of Allaah has sound is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning]: 
“And We called him from the right side of the Mount, and made him draw near to Us for a talk with him [Moosa (Moses)].
[Maryam 19:52] 
Calling and talking can only happen with sound. 
See Sharh Lam’ah al-I’tiqaad by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, p. 73 
Hence the belief of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah is that Allaah speaks in a real sense, when and as and with whatever He wills, with letters and sound, but this does not resemble the voices of created beings. The evidence that it does not resemble the voices of created beings is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“There is nothing like Him, and He is the All‑Hearer, the All‑Seer”[al-Shoora 42:11] 
So it is known from the outset that this is the belief of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah. Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah believe that the Qur’aan is the word of Allaah, and among the evidence for this belief is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if anyone of the Mushrikoon (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allaah) seeks your protection then grant him protection so that he may hear the Word of Allaah”
[al-Tawbah 9:6] 
what is meant here is the Qur’aan, by scholarly consensus. The fact that Allaah mentions kalaam (speech, word) in idaafah (genitive or possessive construction) with Himself  indicates that the Qur’aan is His Word. 
The belief of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah is that the Qur’aan is the word of Allaah which was revealed, not created; it began from Him and will return to Him.  
The evidence that it is revealed is as follows (interpretation of the meanings): 
“The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur’aan”
[al-Baqarah 2:185] 
“Verily, We have sent it (this Qur’aan) down in the Night of Al‑Qadr (Decree)”[al-Qadr 97:1] 
“And (it is) a Qur’aan which We have divided (into parts), in order that you might recite it to men at intervals. And We have revealed it by stages”[al-Israa’ 17:106] 
“And when We change a Verse (of the Qur’aan) in place of another — and Allaah knows best what He sends down — they (the disbelievers) say: ‘You (O Muhammad) are but a Muftari! (forger, liar).’ Nay, but most of them know not.
Say (O Muhammad) Ruh‑ul‑Qudus [Jibreel (Gabriel)] has brought it (the Qur’aan) down from your Lord with truth, that it may make firm and strengthen (the Faith of) those who believe, and as a guidance and glad tidings to those who have submitted (to Allaah as Muslims).
And indeed We know that they (polytheists and pagans) say: ‘It is only a human being who teaches him (Muhammad).’ The tongue of the man they refer to is foreign, while this (the Qur’aan) is a clear Arabic tongue[al-Nahl 16:101-103] 
- the One Who changes a verse in place of another is Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. 
The evidence that the Qur’aan is not created is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Surely, His is the creation and commandment”[al-A’raaf 7:54] 
So Allaah describes creation as one thing and commandment as another. The conjunction implies that the second thing mentioned is different, and the Qur’aan is part of the commandment because of the evidence of the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And thus We have sent to you (O Muhammad) Rooh (a revelation, and a mercy) of Our Command. You knew not what is the Book, nor what is Faith? But We have made it (this Qur’aan) a light wherewith We guide whosoever of Our slaves We will”
[al-Shoora 42:52] 
If the Qur’aan is part of the command or commandment, which is different from creation, therefore it is not created, because if it were created, this division of categories would not be correct. This is the evidence from the Qur’aan. 
The rational evidence is that the Qur’aan is the word of Allaah, and words cannot exist in and of themselves so that they would have a distinct and separate identity.  If they did exist separately and distinct from Allaah, then we would say that they are created, but words are an attribute of the speaker. If they are an attribute of the speaker and they are spoken by Allaah, then they are not created, because the attributes of Allaah are not created. 
Sharhal-‘Aqeedah al-Waasitah by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 1/418-426-441  
We must believe this and be certain of it. We should not change the meanings of the verses of Allaah, for they clearly indicate that the Qur’aan is a revelation from Allaah. Hence Imaam al-Tahhaawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “The Qur’aan is the word of Allaah which came from Him in the form of speech, without any need for us to know how. He sent it down to His Messenger by Revelation, the believers believe that it is true and they are certain that it is indeed the word of Allaah and that it is not created like the words of human beings. Whoever hears it and claims that it is the words of human beings is a kaafir, who is condemned and warned of Hell, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
‘I will cast him into Hell fire’ [al-Muddaththir 74:26]. 
Since Allaah threatened with Hell the one who said, ‘This is nothing but the word of a human being’ [al-Muddaththir 74:26 – interpretation of the meaning], we know and are certain that it is the word of the Creator of mankind, and it does not resemble the speech of human beings.”  Sharh al-‘Aqeedah al-Tahhaawiyyah, 179",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
10160,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10160,Woman Affected by Waswas With Regard to Purity (Taharah),"A woman is suffering from waswas (insinuating whispers of the Shaytan) concerning her taharah (purity) and feeling after she has done wudu (ablution) that she needs to relieve herself. On one occasion she felt that someone was telling her to insult the Quran and insult Allah, and all she could do was weep. How can she deal with this and get rid of these whispers?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Many people suffer from these whispers – there is no power and no strength except with Allah. The way to deal with waswas is to seek refuge with Allah a great deal from the accursed Shaytan, and especially to recite al-Mu’awwadhatayn (the last two soorahs of the Quran), for there is nothing better with which a person may seek refuge with Allah. So she should recite (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say: “I seek refuge with (Allah), the Lord of the daybreak”
[113:1] – to the end of the soorah, which includes seeking refuge from the evil of the Shaytan, because he is one of the creations of Allah. And she should recite Soorah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say: “I seek refuge with (Allah), the Lord of the people”
[al-Nas 114:1] – to the end.
The way to deal with that (waswas) is to seek refuge a great deal in Allah from the accursed Shaytaan, to turn to Allah, and to have sincere resolve, so that one will not pay any attention to whispers that may enter one’s mind.
For example, whether you have done wudu once or twice or three times, you should not pay any attention to the whispers of the Shaytan. Even if you feel that you have not done wudu, for example, or that you neglected some part of the wudu or that you did not have the right intention, you should not pay attention to that. Similarly, if you are praying and you feel or it occurs to you that you did not say “Allahu akbar” at the beginning of the prayer, you should not pay attention to that, and you should carry on and complete your prayer. Similarly, if it crosses your mind – as mentioned in the question – to insult Allah or the Mus-haf (Quran) or any other kind of kufr (disbelief), you should not pay attention to that and it will not harm you. Even if it goes so far as a person uttering the words under compulsion of the waswas, there is no sin on him because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “There is no talaq (divorce) under compulsion.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2193; Ahmad, al-Musnad, 6/276; classed as hasan/sound by al-Albani in al-Irwa, no. 2047. If the divorce that is the result of waswas does not count, then this is more likely to be forgiven, but one should turn away from that and not pay attention to it.
So, my advice to this lady and others who are tested with waswas is to seek refuge a great deal with Allah from the accursed Shaytan, to recite al-Mu’awwadhatayn – Qul a’oodhu bi Rabb il-Falaq and Qul a’oodhu bi Rabb il-nas (the last two soorahs of the Quran) – to have sincere resolve and not to pay attention to these insinuating whispers from the Shaytan.
If the Shaytan manages to instil some doubts in a person’s heart concerning Allah and so on, he should not worry about that, because he is only suffering these doubts because of the faith in his heart. The person who is not a believer does not care whether he doubts or not; the one who suffers because of these doubts and whispers is a believer. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “That is clear faith,” (narrated by Muslim, no. 132), meaning that what the Shaytan casts into your hearts of such matters is a reflection of clear faith, i.e., sincere faith… He described it as sincere faith, because the one who experiences these doubts is not happy about them and should not pay any attention to them; they grieve him and he does not want them. The Shaytan only comes to hearts which are filled with faith in order to destroy it; he does not come to hearts that are devoid of faith, because they are already ruined. It was said to Ibn ‘Abbas or Ibn Mas’ood that the Jews said, “We do not experience waswas during our prayers.” He said, “Of course, what would the Shaytan do with a heart that is already ruined?!”
My advice to her is to ignore all of these whispers. She will find it hard at first, and she will think that she is praying without wudu or without saying “Allahu akbar” at the beginning, and so on, but it will become easier for her after that, and this doubt and waswas will leave her, in sha Allah.
, there are people who suffered with this problem, but they were told how to deal with it and how to resist it, and Allah granted them relief.

Repairing mosques comes under three categories:

The money which was spent on these renovations could have been spent on other mosques which the people could have benefitted from.
2.Renovations which are needed but not essential, such as when floor tiles or plaster are cracked, but the mosque is standing.  A person will be rewarded for this, because it is like cleaning the mosque, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us to build mosques among the houses and to clean and perfume them.

But if you cannot do that, then manifest as much as you can of the symbols of your faith. The religion cannot be confined to the home and the mosque; the religion has to be adhered to in the market-places, streets, companies and all public places. Undoubtedly the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not compromise in matters of his religion. When he was in Makkah, before the Hijrah, he used to pray openly, whilst they were looking on. After the Muslims became a distinct community, a specific style of dress was ordained for them, and they commanded to forsake anything else that was a symbol of kufr and was distinctive to the kuffaar, because this is imitation, and whoever imitates a people is one of them, as it says in the hadeeth.

 You should make the most of the opportunity of being in a Muslim country to remind the people of their Islamic origins and their ties to their religion and Islamic history. The position you are in enables you to say openly whatever you want without fearing any harm – most likely – from the people of that country. Your open display of your religion and wearing Islamic dress will encourage the Muslims and make them keen to manifest their religion. Do not forget to seek reward from Allaah by doing that.

And He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O (you) Messengers! Eat all kinds of lawful foods which Allah has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables, fruits)] and do righteous deeds.” [Al-Mu’minun 23:51]
Then he (peace and blessings be upon him) mentioned a man who travels a great deal and becomes disheveled and covered with dust, who raises his hands to the heavens (and says), ‘O Lord, O Lord,’ when his food is prohibited, his drink is prohibited, his clothes are prohibited and he has been nourished with prohibited, so how can he receive a response?  (Narrated by Muslim) 
The meaning is that it is unlikely that his Du`a will be answered . But prayer, which includes Du`a and other things, will still be accepted, in the sense that it serves to fulfill his obligations, and he does not have to repeat it. What was narrated was that it is the one who drinks alcohol whose prayer will not be accepted for forty days .

It is very anoying and distracting. Please provide an Islamic ruling on this matter.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Islam is keen 
    that the Muslim’s prayer should be perfect in terms of focus and humility, 
    far removed from anything that may distract a person from prayer. Among the 
    things to which Islam pays attention in this regard are the following: 
1 – It was 
    narrated that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “We 
    used to pray with the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) when it was intensely hot. When one of us could not bear to press his 
    face to the ground (because of the heat), he would spread his garment and 
    prostrate on it.”
(Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 1150; Muslim, 620). 
Al-Haafiz ibn 
    Hajar said: 
The apparent 
    meaning is that they did that in order to remove the distraction caused by 
    the ground being too hot. 
Fath 
    al-Baari, 1/493 
2 – It was narrated from 
    ‘Aa’ishah that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    prayed in a shirt on which there were designs, and when he finished praying 
    he said, “Take this shirt of mine to Abu Jahm and bring me the inbijaaniyyah 
    (a woollen garment that was plain, with no designs) of Abu Jahm, for it 
    distracted me from my prayer.” Haashim ibn ‘Urwah narrated from his father 
    from ‘Aa’ishah that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “I used to look at its designs whilst I was praying and I was 
    afraid that it would distract me.” 
(Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 366; Muslim, 556) 
3 – It was 
    narrated from ‘Aa’ishah that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said: “If the iqaamah for ‘Isha’ prayer is given and dinner is 
    ready, then start with dinner.” 
(Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 5148; Muslim, 558) 
al-Haafiz 
    said: 
al-Faakihaani said: This 
    should be interpreted in general terms, applicable to any situation where 
    there is a distraction that may lead to a person not being sufficiently 
    humble and focused (in prayer). 
Fath 
    al-Baari, 2/160 
4 – It was 
    narrated that Abu Saalih al-Sammaan said: I saw Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri on a 
    Friday, praying facing something that screened him from the people. A young 
    man from among Bani Abi Mu’eet wanted to pass in front of him, and Abu 
    Sa’eed pushed him in the chest. The young man looked and could not find any 
    way to pass except in front of him, so he tried again, and Abu Sa’eed pushed 
    him more strongly than the first time. The young man insulted Abu Sa’eed and 
    entered upon Marwaan, and complained to him about what Abu Sa’eed had done 
    to him. Abu Sa’eed came in behind him, and Marwaan said to him, “What is the 
    matter with you and your brother’s son, O Abu Sa’eed?” He said, “I heard the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, 
    ‘If any one of you is praying facing something that is screening him from 
    the people, and someone wants to pass in front of him, let him push him 
    back, and if he insists then let him fight him, for he is a devil.’”
(Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 487; Muslim, 505) 
Al-Zarqaani 
    said: The phrase “for he is a devil” means that he is doing the actions of 
    the Shaytaan, because he is insisting on disturbing someone who is praying. 
(Sharh 
    al-Zarqaani, 1/442). 
5 – It was narrated that 
    Abu Sa’eed said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) went into i’tikaaf (retreat) in the mosque, and he heard them 
    reciting Qur’aan out loud. He drew back the curtain and said, “Each of you 
    is conversing privately with his Lord, so do not disturb one another or 
    raise your voices above one another when reading Qur’aan – or he said, when 
    praying.” 
(Narrated by 
    Abu Dawood, 1332) 
We should 
    note in this last hadeeth that the Messenger  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) forbade the people to distract one another from prayer 
    by their prayer or Qur’aan-reading. He forbade people to distract others 
    from prayer by their prayer or Qur’aan-reading. He did not like the prayer 
    or Qur’aan-reading of one person to distract another person from his prayer.
 In 
    conclusion: Islam encourages focus and humility in prayer, and encourages us 
    to persist in that. What we see of these mobile phones in the situation you 
    mention is something that causes people to lose the proper focus and 
    humility in prayer, because it is a disturbance that affects the spirit and 
    tranquility of prayer.
 We advise 
    our brothers who own these phones not to leave them switched on at the time 
    of prayer, rather they should turn off the ringer.",Islam Q&A
10195,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10195,Does feeling pleased with one’s grades contradict sincerity of intention in seeking knowledge?,I am a student and I like to get good grades and excellent reports. But at the same time my intention is good. What is your view on feeling pleased with good grades and feeling upset with poor grades – does this undermine sincerity of intention?,,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          It appears, in sha’ Allaah, that this does not undermine 
          sincerity of intention, because it is natural for a person to feel happy 
          about something good and be upset by something bad. Allaah has explained 
          that things which do not agree with man are called bad things (sayi’ah), 
          so that should upset him, and that the good things (hasanah) should 
          make him feel happy. 
 
          This does not affect your sincerity of intention if, 
          as you say, your intention is good. But if your concern is only your 
          grades or certificate, then this is another matter. Look at ‘Abd-Allaah 
          ibn ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him), when the 
          Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) posed a question to his 
          companions and said, “Among the trees there is one which resembles the 
          believer.” The Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) started guessing 
          the names of all kind of trees, guessing the names of desert trees. 
          Ibn ‘Umar said: “I thought that it was the date-palm, but I was young 
          and I did not want to speak.” (narrated by al-Bukhaari, Kitaab al-‘Ilm). 
‘Umar (may 
          Allaah be pleased with him) said to his son, “I wish that you had said 
          it.” This indicates that there is nothing wrong with a person feeling 
          happy when he does well and the like.","From Fataawa al- Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, Kitaab al-‘Ilm, p. 133"
10196,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10196,What is the ruling on a father preventing his daughter from marrying who she wants?,Some fathers prevent their daughters from marrying someone who is compatible with them. What is the ruling on this? What is the daughters’ position?,,,"Praise be to Allah.This question was put to Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him), who said: 
This is a serious issue and a major problem. Some men – we seek refuge with Allaah – betray Allaah and betray their trust, and cause problems for their daughters. The guardian is obliged to do that which pleases Allaah and His Messenger. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who has no wife and the woman who has no husband)” –  i.e., give your daughters in marriage  – “and (also marry) the Saalihoon (pious, fit and capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid-servants (female slaves).” [al-Noor 24:32]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If there comes to you one with whose character and religious commitment you are pleased, then marry (your female relative under your guardianship) to him, for if you do not do so, there will be tribulation and great mischief on earth.” 
Some people – we seek refuge with Allaah – make their daughter a commodity to be sold to whoever they want, and they prevent her from marrying whoever they do not want. So they marry their daughter to a man whose character and religious commitment are not pleasing, because that suits their whims, and they prevent her from marrying one whose character and religious commitment are pleasing, because that does not suit them. 
Would that we could reach the level where a woman whose father prevents her from marrying one whose character and religious commitment are compatible could go to the qaadi and he would tell her father, “Marry her to him or I or a guardian other than you will do so,” because a girl has the right, if her father prevents her from marrying someone, (and she complains to the qaadi). This is a right given by sharee’ah. Would that we could reach this level, but most girls are prevented by their shyness from doing this. 
Our advice to the father is still to fear Allaah and not to prevent her from marrying, because that may cause her to do something wrong and may lead to mischief. Let him ask himself, if he were prevented from marrying, what would happen to him?  
His daughter whom he prevented from marrying will become his opponent on the Day of Resurrection: 
“That Day shall a man flee from his brother,
And from his mother and his father,
And from his wife and his children.
Every man that Day will have enough to make him careless of others” [‘Abasa 80:34-37 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Guardians, including fathers and brothers, must fear Allaah and not deny women their right to marry the one whose religious commitment and character is pleasing to them. 
Yes, if a woman chooses someone whose religious commitment and character are not pleasing, then he (the father or guardian) may prevent her from marrying him. But if she chooses a righteous man whose religious commitment and character are good, then he prevents her from marrying because of his own whims and desires, this is haraam, by Allaah, and it is a sin and a betrayal. If any mischief results from this, the sin will be on him (the father).",Al-Liqa’ al-Shahri by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen

Allaah 
          has told us in the Qur’aan the stories of the earlier and later generations 
          and the creation of the heavens and the earth. He has explained in detail 
          what is halaal and what is haraam, the basics of good manners and morals, 
          the rulings of worship and dealings with others, the lives of the Prophets

          it (the Qur’aan) an explanation of all things: 
“And We have sent down to you the Book 
          (the Qur’aan) as an exposition of everything, a guidance, a mercy, and 
          glad tidings for those who have submitted themselves (to Allaah as Muslims)”
[al-Nahl 16:89 – interpretation of the meaning]  
          
The 
          Qur’aan explains the names and attributes of Allaah and what He has

          Messengers and the Last Day:  
“The Messenger (Muhammad) believes in 
          what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. 
          Each one believes in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers.

          Qur’aan describes the Day of Judgement and what will happen after death

          Qur’aan, or are their hearts locked up (from understanding it)?”
[Muhammad 47:24 – interpretation of the meaning]  
          
The Qur’aan is the Book of Allaah for all 
          of mankind:  
“Verily, We have sent down to you (O Muhammad) the 
          Book (this Qur’aan) for mankind in truth. So whosoever accepts the guidance, 
          it is only for his ownself; and whosoever goes astray, he goes astray 
          only for his (own) loss. And you (O Muhammad) are not a Wakeel (trustee 
          or disposer of affairs, or guardian) over them”[al-Zumar 39:41 – interpretation 
          of the meaning]  
The Qur’aan confirms the Books which came 
          before it, the Tawraat (Torah) and Injeel (Gospel), and it is a witness 
          over them, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad) the Book 
          (this Qur’aan) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it 
          and Muhaymin (trustworthy in highness and a witness) over it (old Scriptures)”[al-Maa'idah 
          5:48]  
After the Qur’aan was revealed, it became 
          the Book for all of mankind until the Hour begins. Whoever does not 
          believe in it is a kaafir who will be punished with torment on the Day 
          of Resurrection, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
          
“But those who reject Our Ayaat (proofs, evidences, 
          verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), the torment will touch them 
          for their disbelief (and for their belying the Message of Muhammad)”[al-An’aam 
          6:49]  
Because of the greatness of the Qur’aan and 
          the signs, miracles, parables and lessons contained therein, in addition 
          to its eloquence and beautiful style, Allaah says (interpretation of 
          the meaning):  
“Had We sent down this Qur’aan on a mountain, you 
          would surely have seen it humbling itself and rent asunder by the fear 
          of Allaah. Such are the parables which We put forward to mankind that 
          they may reflect”[al-Hashr 58:21]  
Allaah has challenged mankind and the jinn 
          to produce something like it, even one soorah or one aayah, but they 
          could not do that and will never be able to do that, as Allaah says 
          (interpretation of the meaning):  
“Say: ‘If the mankind and the jinn were together 
          to produce the like of this Qur’aan, they could not produce the like 
          thereof, even if they helped one another’”[al-Israa’ 17:88]
Because the Qur’aan 
          is the greatest of the heavenly Books, the most complete, the most perfect 
          and the last of them, Allaah commanded His Messenger Muhammad 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to convey it to all of mankind, 
          as He says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“O Messenger (Muhammad)! Proclaim (the Message) which 
          has been sent down to you from your Lord. And if you do not, then you 
          have not conveyed His Message. Allaah will protect you from mankind” 
          [al-Maa'idah 5:67]
Because of the importance 
          of this book and the ummah’s need for it, Allaah has honoured us with 
          it. He sent it down to us and has guaranteed to preserve it. Allaah 
          says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr
