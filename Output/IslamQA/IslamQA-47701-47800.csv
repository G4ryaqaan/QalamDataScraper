47705,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47705,Can she give charity from her housekeeping money without her husband’s knowledge?,"My husband gives me some money for myself and my daughters every month, and I set aside a certain amount for charity without consulting him. Is it permissible to do this or do I have to consult him and ask him if he agrees to me giving this money in charity or not?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is 
    nothing wrong with a woman giving charity from her husband’s wealth if he 
    has given her permission to do so. This permission may be explicit (verbal), 
    such as if he says to her: “You can give such and such of my wealth in 
    charity, or whatever you wish.” 
Or this 
    permission may be implicit, such as if people ordinarily agree to such 
    things or it is known from her husband’s attitude that he will agree to that 
    and will not object. 
In that case 
    there is nothing wrong with her giving charity from her husband’s wealth, 
    and she will have the reward for that charity as will her husband too. 
But if he 
    does not allow her, or if she knows that he would not agree to that, then in 
    that case it is not permissible for her to give anything from his wealth in 
    charity. 
Ibn Qudaamah 
    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (4/301): 
Is it 
    permissible for a woman to give a small amount in charity from her husband’s 
    wealth without his permission? There are two views. One is that it is 
    permissible, because ‘Aa’ishah said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No woman spends anything from her 
    husband’s household, without causing any harm, but she will have the reward 
    for that, and he will have a similar reward because he earned it, and she 
    will have a reward because she spent it, and the storekeeper will have a 
    similar reward, without it detracting from the reward of any of them in the 
    slightest.” And he did not mention the issue of permission. 
It was 
    narrated from Asma’ that she came to the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allaah, I have nothing but 
    that which al-Zubayr gives me. Is there any sin on me if I give charity from 
    that which is given to me? He said: Give whatever you can. According to a 
    report narrated by al-Bukhaari: “Give charity.” Agreed upon. 
The custom 
    is to allow that and agree to it, and this implies permission. 
The second 
    view is that it is not permitted, but the first view is more sound. 
If he 
    forbids her to do that and says “Do not give anything in charity, do not 
    donate a small or large amount of my wealth,” then it is not permissible for 
    her to do that. End quote. 
The fact 
    that it is not permissible for a woman to give any of her husband’s wealth 
    in charity except with his permission is the hadeeth narrated by Abu Dawood 
    (3565) from Abu Umaamah (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: I heard 
    the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    say: “A woman should not spend anything from her husband’s household except 
    with his permission.” It was said: “O Messenger of Allaah, not even food?” 
    He said: “That is the best of our wealth.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani 
    in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
“Except with 
    the permission of her husband” means explicit or implicit permission, as 
    stated in ‘Awn al-Ma’bood. 
The Standing 
    Committee was asked about a woman who gave charity from her husband’s wealth 
    without permission.  
They 
    replied: The basic principle is that a woman does not have the right to give 
    any of her husband’s wealth in charity without his permission, except small 
    things that are customarily given, such as upholding ties with neighbours 
    and those who ask for help by giving small amounts that will not affect her 
    husband, and the reward will be shared between them as the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, … then they quoted the 
    hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah that is mentioned above. End quote.  
Fataawa 
    al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (10/81). 
Shaykh Ibn 
    ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it permissible for a 
    woman to give charity from her husband’s wealth on her own behalf or on 
    behalf of one who is dead? 
He replied: 
    It is well known that the husband’s wealth belongs to the husband and it is 
    not permissible for anyone to give charity from the wealth of anyone else 
    except with his permission. If the husband has given her permission to give 
    charity on her own behalf, or on behalf of whomever she wishes among her 
    deceased loved ones, there is no sin on her, but if he has not given 
    permission then it is not permissible for her to give anything in charity, 
    because it is his wealth and it is not permissible to take the wealth of a 
    Muslim without his consent. End quote.

47721,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47721,Can Husband Suck Wife's Breasts?,Is it permissible for a man to suck on his wife’s breasts during intercourse?,"It is permissible for the husband to suck his wife’s breasts, and if any milk reaches his stomach it does not have the effect of making him a mahram.","Husband-Wife sexual relation: Do and Don’ts 


Sucking wife’ breasts: Permissible? 


Can a husband touch wife’s private parts?","Praise be to Allah.Husband-Wife sexual relation: Do and Don’ts 
The husband may enjoy intimacy with his wife in whatever way he wishes; the only thing that is forbidden is anal intercourse and intercourse during the wife’s menstrual period or nifas (post-partum bleeding). Apart from that, he may enjoy his wife in whatever way he wants, such as kissing, touching, looking, etc. 
Sucking wife’ breasts: Permissible? 
Even if he sucks on her nipples, this comes under the heading of the intimacy that is permissible, and it cannot be said that the milk has any effect on him , because if an adult breastfeeds, it does not have any effect of making him a mahram. Rather the breastfeeding that has this effect is that which takes place during the first two years of life. 
The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 
“It is permissible for a husband to enjoy all of his wife’s body, apart from the back passage and intercourse during the wife’s menstrual period or nifas (postpartum bleeding), or when in ihram for Hajj or ‘Umrah, until he has exited ihram completely.” (Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allah ibn Qa’ud, Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 19/351, 352)  
The scholars of the Standing Committee said:  
“It is permissible for the husband to suck his wife’s breasts, and if any milk reaches his stomach it does not have the effect of making him a mahram.” (Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh ‘Abd al-Razzaq ‘Afifi, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allah al-Ghadyyan, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allah ibn Qa’ud) 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin said: 
“Breastfeeding by an adult does not have the effect of making him a mahram, because the breastfeeding that has that effect is five breastfeedings or more within the first two years of life before weaning. Breastfeeding by an adult does not have that effect. Based on this, if we assume that someone breastfed from his wife or drank her milk, he cannot become a son to her.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 3/338)
Can a husband touch wife’s private parts?
With regard to it being permissible to enjoy anything concerning which there is no prohibition, there follow some of the views of the scholars: 
Ibn Qudamah said: 
“There is nothing wrong with enjoying the area between the buttocks without any penetration, because what is forbidden is the back passage , which is mentioned specifically, which is forbidden because of the filth, and that is specific to the back passage, therefore it is expressly forbidden.” (Al-Mughni, 7/226)
Al-Kasani said: 
“Among the sahih rulings on marriage is that it is permissible to look at and touch every part of her from head to foot when she is alive, because intercourse goes beyond looking and touching, so it is more appropriate that touching and looking should be permitted.” (Badai' al-Sanai’, 2/231)
Ibn ‘Abidin said: 
“Abu Yusuf asked Abu Hanifah about a man who touches his wife’s private part and she touches his to stimulate arousal – did he see anything wrong with that? He said: No, and I hope that the reward will be greater.” (Radd al-Muhtar, 6/367)
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated that this is permissible when he forbade intercourse in the vagina with a menstruating woman , but he permitted all other parts of her body. So it is more obvious that it is permissible at times other than menstruation. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
“The words “He may enjoy everything else of her apart from that” means that the man may enjoy every part of the menstruating woman apart from the vagina. 
It is permissible to enjoy what is above and below the waist wrapper (izar), but the woman should be wrapped in a waist wrapper, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to tell ‘Aishah to wrap herself in a waist-wrapper when she was menstruating, then he would be intimate with her. He told her to do that lest he saw something that he disliked, namely the menstrual blood. But if the husband wants to enjoy the area between the thighs, for example, there is nothing wrong with that. 
If it is said: What do you say about the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he was asked what part of his wife is permissible for a man when she is menstruating and he said, “You have that which is above the waist-wrapper” and this indicates that one may only enjoy that which is above the waist-wrapper?  
The answer is as follows: 

That is in order to be on the safe side and to avoid that which is forbidden.
It may vary according to circumstances. The words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Do everything apart from intercourse” may be taken as being addressed to one who can control himself, and the words, “You have that which is above the waist-wrapper” may be taken as being addressed to one who cannot control himself, either because his religious commitment is too weak or his desire is too strong.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 1/417)

47732,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47732,What are the places where the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stopped to say du’aa’ during Hajj?,What are the places where the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stopped to say du’aa’?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.It seems that the places referred to in the question are the places where the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stopped to say du’aa’ during hajj. The scholars have told us that there are six places. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
His Hajj included six places where he stopped to offer du’aa’: 
The first was atop al-Safa; the second was atop al-Marwah; the third was in ‘Arafah; the fourth was in Muzdalifah; the fifth was at the first Jamarah; and the sixth was at the second Jamarah. 
Zaad al-Ma’aad, 2/287, 288 
The details of these places are as follows: 
1 – Du’aa’ at al-Safa and al-Marwah: 
This involves turning to face the qiblah and saying du’aa’ after saying takbeer three times, then reciting the dhikr narrated in the Sunnah three times, and making du’aa’ in between that. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
He should say “Allaah akbar” with his hands raised as in du’aa’, three times, then recite the dhikrs narrated (in the Sunnah), such as “Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadeer; laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu, anjaza wa’dah wa nasara ‘abdah wa hazama al-ahzaaba wahdah (There is no god but Allaah alone with no partner or associate, His is the dominion and to Him be praise and He has power over all things; there is no god but Allaah alone, He fulfilled His promise, granted victory to His slave and defeated the confederates alone).” Then he may recite whatever du’aa’s he likes, then he should repeat the dhikr again, then make du’aa’ as he likes, then repeat the dhikr a third time, then come down and head towards al-Marwah. 
Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 7/268. 
This du’aa’ may be recited at the beginning of the lap or at the end, because there is no du’aa’ to be recited atop al-Marwah at the end of the lap. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
From this we also learn that du’aa’ atop al-Safa and al-Marwah may be done at the beginning of the lap and not at the end, and that there is no du’aa’ to be recited at the end atop al-Marwah, because that is the end of saa’i. Rather du’aa’ should be recited at the beginning of the lap as takbeer should also be recited in tawaaf at the beginning of the circuit. Based on this, when (the pilgrim) has finished saa’i at al-Marwah he should leave, and when he finishes tawaaf at the Black Stone he should leave. There is no need to kiss or touch the Black Stone, or to point to it. Before anyone raises any objections we say: this is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did. 
Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 7/352 
2 – Du’aa’ on the day of ‘Arafaah lasts until sunset. The pilgrim should make a lot of du’aa’ on this day. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The best of du’aa’ is du’aa’ on the day of ‘Arafaah, and the best thing that I and the Prophets before me said is Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka lah (There is no god but Allaah alone with no partner or associate). Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3585; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
3 – It is Sunnah for the pilgrim to make du’aa’ in Muzdalifah raising his hands and facing the qiblah, from after Fajr prayer until it has become very light. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“remember Allaah (by glorifying His Praises, i.e. prayers and invocations) at the Mash‘ar-il-Haraam (i.e., Muzdalifah)”
[al-Baqarah 2:198]
4 – Du’aa’ after stoning the first (smallest) Jamarah and the second (middle) Jamarah. That is during the days of al-Tashreeq. It is not prescribed to say du’aa’ after stoning the largest Jamarah, either on the Day of Sacrifice or afterwards.

It is not permissible allow the kuffaar to take up residence in the Arabian Peninsula. The scholars differed at to the definition of the boundaries of the Arabian Peninsula, but they did not differ as to the fact that Madeenah is part of it. 
Ibn Qudaamah said: 
It is not permissible for any of them (the kuffaar) to live in the Hijaaz. This is the view of Maalik and al-Shaafa’i, but Maalik said: I think that they should be expelled from all the Arab lands, because the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Two religions cannot coexist in the Arabian Peninsula.” Abu Dawood narrated with his isnaad from ‘Umar that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “I will certainly expel the Jews and the Christians from the Arabian Peninsula,, and I will not leave anyone there but Muslims.” Al-Tirmidhi said: this is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. And it was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) left behind three instructions. He said: Expel the mushrikeen from the Arabian Peninsula, honour the delegations the way that I do, and he kept quiet about the third. Narrated by Abu Dawood. 
Al-Mughni, 9/285, 286. 
Secondly: 
It is permissible for kuffaar to enter Madeenah for the purposes of trade, without staying there. They should be given enough time (to complete their business) then they should be told to leave. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
It is permissible for them to enter the Hijaaz for the purpose of trade, because the Christians used to trade with Madeenah at the time of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). An old Christian man came to him in Madeenah and said: “I am an old Christian man and your agent has taken the tithe from me twice.” ‘Umar said: “I am an old monotheist (haneef) man,” and ‘Umar wrote to the agent and said: “Only take the tithe once in a year, and do not allow them to stay for more than three days.” This is what was narrated from ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) and they should leave after that. Al-Qaadi said: Four days is the limit after which a traveller must offer prayers in full. 
Al-Mughni, 9/286. 
Thirdly: 
What we have mentioned about Madeenah and its sanctuary does not apply to the sanctuary of Makkah. The kuffaar are forbidden to enter it under any circumstances. 
It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (3/130, 131): 
The majority of scholars – including Muhammad ibn al-Hasan among the Hanafis – are of the view that it is not permissible for kuffaar to enter the sanctuary of Makkah at all, The view of the Hanafis is that that is permissible if there is a treaty or they have permission. 
With regard to the sanctuary of Madeenah, it is not forbidden for them to enter to bring a message, for trade or to bring some goods. A kaafir may not enter other parts of the Arab lands without permission or a treaty. The fuqaha’ have discussed this matter in detail.Ends.

 My question is: I used to say: “I promise you, my Lord, that I will not go back to this evil habit,” but I used to go back and do it again, not to make light of Allaah but because of the Shaytaan and my own whims and desires.

    We have already explained in the answer to question no.
    329 
    that the secret habit is haraam and how to rid oneself of this habit. The 
    Muslim does not have to make promises and vows in order to give up the 
    things that Allaah has forbidden to him. It is sufficient for him to know 
    that it is haraam and that should be enough to make him give it up. If he 
    makes a promise or a vow to Allaah not to do the haraam thing then he goes 
    and does it again, then he has committed the sin of doing something haraam 
    as well as the sin of breaking a promise or going back on an oath or vow. 

    Allaah has enjoined fulfilling promises, as He says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And fulfil (every) covenant. Verily, the covenant will 
    be questioned about”

    [al-Isra’ 17:34]

    al-Jassaas said: 

    The words “and fulfil (every) covenant” mean – and Allaah 
    knows best – that it is obligatory to fulfil the promises that one makes to 
    Allaah through vows and promises to do acts of worship. Allaah has obliged 
    us to fulfil them, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And of them are some who 
    made a covenant with Allaah (saying): ‘If He bestowed on us of His Bounty, 
    we will verily, give Sadaqah (Zakaah and voluntary charity in Allaah’s 
    Cause) and will be certainly among those who are righteous.’

    76. Then when He gave them of His Bounty, they became 
    niggardly [refused to pay the Sadaqah (Zakaah or voluntary charity)], and 
    turned away, averse.

    77. So He punished them by putting hypocrisy into their 
    hearts”

    [al-Tawbah 9:75-77]

    Ahkaam al-Qur’aan, 3/299 

    Al-Sarkhasi said: 

    Fulfilling promises is obligatory. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And fulfil the Covenant of Allaah (Bay‘ah: pledge for 
    Islam) when you have covenanted”

    [al-Nahl 16:91]

    And He condemns those who do not do fulfil their promises by 
    saying (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And of them are some who made a covenant with Allaah…” 
    [al-Tawbah 9:75]. 
Al-Mabsoot, 3/94 

    Whoever makes a promise to Allaah to do something and does 
    not do it, or makes a promise not to do something and does it, then he has 
    committed the sin of breaking that promise, and he has to offer expiation 
    for breaking an oath (kafaarat yameen), because a promise is a kind of oath 
    or vow, and the one who breaks an oath or vow has to offer kafaarat yameen. 
    He is given the choice of freeing a slave, or feeding ten poor persons, or 
    clothing them. Whoever cannot do any of these things has to fast for three 
    days. 

    Ibn Qudaamah said: 

    If a person says: I solemnly promise to Allaah that I will do 
    such and such, then this is an oath in which the intention was to swear an 
    oath to Allaah. 

    Al-Mughni, 9/400. 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 

    Promises and vows are verily similar. If a person says: I 
    promise Allaah that I will do Hajj this year, then this is a vow and a 
    promise and an oath. If he says, I will not speak to Zayd, this is an oath 
    and a promise but not a vow. But an oath is a vow when a person promises to 
    an act or worship or an action by means of which he may draw closer to 
    Allaah.   

    Al-Fataawa al-Kubra, 5/553. 

    This is also the view of Ibn ‘Abbaas, Maalik, ‘Ata’, 
    al-Zuhri, al-Nakha’i, al-Shu’bi and Yahya ibn Sa’eed, as it says in 
    al-Mudawwanah, 1/579, 580. 

    In conclusion: You have to offer kafaarat yameen for breaking 
    your promise to Allaah. We ask Allaah to bless you with guidance, piety, 
    chastity and independence of means.

[al-Najm 53:32] 

I know that lamam (translated here as “small faults”) means minor sins, such as looking, kissing and touching, and these sins will be forgiven by Allaah so long as major sins are avoided. 

My question is: does this mean that a person will not be punished for these sins even in this world, if he repents from them then does them again, and repents again and goes back to them again? Will he not be punished by Allaah for committing these sins?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    In the answer to the question no.

    faults’” we have discussed the different scholarly opinions on the meaning 
    of the word lamam in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Those who avoid great sins and Al‑Fawaahish (illegal 
    sexual intercourse) except the small faults (lamam)…”

    [al-Najm 53:32]

    The majority of scholars are of the view that lamam 
    refers to minor sins. 

    This does not mean that a person may be negligent with regard 
    to the matter of committing minor sins, rather persisting in minor sins 
    makes them major sins, which means that they are no longer minor faults. 

    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Sharh 
    Muslim: 
The scholars (may Allaah 
    have mercy on them) said that persisting in a minor sin makes it a major 
    sin. It was narrated from ‘Umar, Ibn ‘Abbaas and others (may Allaah be 
    pleased with them) that there is no major sin with prayers for forgiveness 
    and no minor sin if one persists in it. 
What this means is that a 
    major sin may be erased by praying for forgiveness, but a minor sin may 
    become a major sin if one persists in it. End quote. 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa 
    (15/293): 

    Adultery is a major sin, but looking and touching are 
    lamam (minor sins) which may be forgiven if one avoids major sin. But if 
    a person persists in looking or touching, that becomes a major sin, and 
    persisting in that may be worse than a small amount of major sin, for 
    persisting in looking with desire, along with the connected feelings of 
    mixing and touching, may be much worse than the evil of an isolated act of 
    zina. Hence the fuqaha’ said concerning the witness of good character: he 
    does not commit a major sin or persist in a minor sin… Indeed, looking and 
    touching may lead a man to shirk as Allaah says (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 

    “And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others 
    besides Allaah as rivals (to Allaah). They love them as they love Allaah”

    [al-Baqarah 2:165]

    The one who is in love becomes a slave to the one he loves. 
    end quote. 

    The Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) warned us against being negligent with regard to minor sins, and said: 

    “Beware of minor sins, like a people who camped in the bottom 
    of a valley, and one man brought a stick, another man brought a stick, and 
    so on, until they managed to bake their bread. There are some insignificant 
    sins which, once (they accumulate) and a person is questioned about them, 
    they lead to his doom.”

    Narrated by Ahmad, 2/223, from the hadeeth of Sahl ibn Sa’d 
    (may Allaah have mercy on him). Al-Haafiz said: Its isnaad is hasan. 

    Ahmad (3803) narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Beware of minor sins, for they 
    accumulate until they doom a man,” and the Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave a likeness of that: “Like people 
    who camped in the wilderness, and one man brought a stick, another man 
    brought a stick, and so on, until they accumulated a lot, then they lit a 
    fire and cooked their food.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh 
    al-Jaami’, 2687. 
Ibn Maajah (4243) 
    narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger 
    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to me: “O 
    ‘Aa’ishah, beware of deeds that are regarded as insignificant, for they have 
    a pursuer from Allaah.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn 
    Maajah. 

    Al-Ghazaali said: 

    Repeatedly committing small sins has a great effect of 
    blackening the heart. It is like the effect of water dripping onto rock, 
    which will inevitably erode it, even though water is liquid and rock is 
    solid. End quote. 

    The poet spoke well when he said: 

    Do not think of minor sins as insignificant, for mountains 
    are made out of pebbles. 

    Secondly: 

    If a person repents from his sin, then it is forgiven and he 
    will not be punished for it, either in this world or in the Hereafter. Hence 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The one 
    who repents from sin is like one who did not sin at all.” Narrated by Ibn 
    Maajah, 4250. al-Haafiz said: Its isnaad is hasan; it was also classed as 
    hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. 

    Al-Nawawi said: 
The scholars (may Allaah 
    be pleased with them) are agreed that repentance is accepted so long as the 
    death rattle has not reached the throat, as it says in the hadeeth. There 
    are three pillars or essential parts of repentance: the person must give up 
    the sin, regret doing it, and resolve not to go back to it. 

    If a person repents from sin then goes back to it, that does 
    not invalidate his repentance, and if he repents from one sin then commits 
    another, his repentance is still valid. This is the correct view. End 
    quote. 

    He also said: 

    If a person repeats the sin a hundred times or a thousand 
    times or more, and repents each time, his repentance is accepted and his sin 
    is erased. Even if he were to repent once after all these sins, his 
    repentance would be valid. End quote. 

    In al-Saheehayn it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said in a hadeeth qudsi: “A person committed a sin and 
    said, ‘O Allaah, forgive me my sin.’ Allaah said: ‘My slave has committed a 
    sin, but he knew that he has a Lord Who forgives sins and punishes for sin.’ 
    Then he committed the sin again and said: ‘O Lord, forgive me my sin.’ 
    Allaah said: ‘My slave has committed a sin, but he knew that he has a Lord 
    Who forgives sins and punishes for sin.’ Then he committed the sin again and 
    said: ‘O Lord, forgive me my sin.’ Allaah said: ‘My slave has committed a 
    sin, but he knew that he has a Lord Who forgives sins and punishes for sin. 
    Do what you wish, for I have forgiven you.’” According to another report: “I 
    have forgiven My slave, so let him do what he wishes.” 

    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    The words “Do what you wish, for I have forgiven you” mean: 
    so long as you sin then repent, I will forgive you. 

    Whatever the case, the mercy of Allaah is vast and His bounty 
    is immense. Whoever repents, Allaah will accept his repentance. But the 
    Muslim should not take the risk of committing sins because he may not be 
    able to repent. What is mentioned in the hadeeth is for the purpose of 
    explaining how great the mercy of Allaah is and how immense His bounty, not 
    to encourage people to commit sin.

47756,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47756,What is the Multazam? How should one make du’aa’ there?,What is the Multazam? How should one make du’aa’ there?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The multazam (place of 
    clinging) is the part of the Ka’bah that is between the Black Stone and the 
    door of the Ka’bah. What is meant by iltizaam (clinging) is when the 
    supplicant (person making du’aa’) places his chest, face, forearms and palms 
    against it and calls upon Allaah saying whatever du’aa’ he wishes. 

    There is no specific du’aa’ that the Muslim should say in 
    that place. He can cling to the Multazam when he enters the Ka’bah (if it is 
    easy for him to enter) or he may do that before performing the Farewell 
    tawaaf (tawaaf al-wadaa’), or he may do it at any time he wants. He should 
    not cause difficulty for other people by offering a lengthy du’aa’. 
    Similarly it is not permissible to crowd other people or annoy them in order 
    to cling there. If he sees a space then he should say du’aa’. Otherwise it 
    is sufficient for him to say du’aa’ whilst circumambulating and when 
    prostrating in prayer. 

    What was narrated from the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased 
    with them) concerning the Multazam is more sound than that which has been 
    narrated from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 

    It was narrated that ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Safwaan said: When 
    the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    conquered Makkah, I said: I will put on my garments, as my house was on the 
    road, and I will wait and see what the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) does. So I went and I saw that the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had come out of the Ka’bah, 
    he and his companions, and they were touching the House from the Door to the 
    Black Stone. They had placed their cheeks against the House and the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was in 
    the midst of them. Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1898; Ahmad, 15124. 

    Its isnaad includes Yazeed ibn Abi Ziyaad, who was classed as 
    da’eef (weak) by Ibn Mu’een, Abu Haatim, Abu Zar’ah and others. 

    It was narrated from ‘Amr ibn Shu’ayb that his father said: I 
    circumambulated the Ka’bah with ‘Abd-Allaah, and when we came to the back of 
    the Ka’bah I said: Will you not seek refuge with Allaah? He said: We seek 
    refuge with Allaah from the Fire. Then he proceeded to touch the Stone, and 
    he stood between the Corner and the door, and placed his chest, face, 
    forearms and hands like this, and spread them out. Then he said: This is 
    what I saw the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) do. Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1899; Ibn Maajah, 2962. 

    Its isnaad includes al-Muthanna ibn al-Sabaah, who was 
    classed as da’eef (weak) by Imam Ahmad, Ibn Mu’een, al-Tirmidhi, al-Nasaa’i 
    and others. 

    But these two ahaadeeth corroborate one another. 

    Shaykh al-Albaani classed it as saheeh in al-Silsilah 
    al-Saheehah, 2138. 

    And he narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) said: “The Multazam is between the Corner and the door.” 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
If (the pilgrim) wants to 
    go the Multazam – which is the area between the Black Stone and the door – 
    and place his chest, face, forearms and hands against it and make du’aa’ and 
    ask Allaah for what he needs, he may do so. He may do that before the 
    farewell tawaaf, for it does not matter if this iltizaam (clinging) is done 
    at the time of the farewell tawaaf or at another time. The Sahaabah used to 
    do that when they entered Makkah. If he wishes he may say the du’aa’ that 
    was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas: “O Allaah, I am Your slave, son of Your male 
    slave, son of Your female slave. You have caused me to ride that which You 
    have subjugated to me of Your creation and You caused me to travel through 
    Your land until You caused me to reach Your house by Your grace, and You 
    have helped me to perform my rituals (of pilgrimage). If You were pleased 
    with me then I hope that you will be more pleased, otherwise be pleased with 
    me now before I depart from Your House, for now I am about to depart if You 
    permit, without turning to anyone but You and seeking to visit any house 
    other than Yours. O Allaah, give me good health in my body and protect my 
    religious commitment; let me find my family well and safe upon my return and 
    help me to obey You so long as You keep me alive, and join me, and give me 
    the good of this world and the Hereafter, for You are able to do all 
    things.” 

    If he stands by the door and prays there without clinging to 
    the House, that is also good. 

    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 26/142, 
    143. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
This is a 
    matter concerning which the scholars differed, although it was not narrated 
    from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (i.e. that 
    was not narrated in a saheeh hadeeth, as the ahaadeeth that were narrated 
    concerning this were deemed to be da’eef or weak). Rather it was narrated 
    from some of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them). So is iltizaam 
    (clinging) Sunnah? When should it be done – upon arrival or when about to 
    leave, or at any time? 

    The reason for this difference of opinion among the scholars 
    is that it is not narrated in the Sunnah of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), rather the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased 
    with them) used to do that when they arrived in Makkah. 
The fuqaha’ said: He (the 
    pilgrim) should do that when about to leave, and should cling to the 
    multazam, which is the area between the corner where the Black Stone is 
    located and the door…

     Based on this, there is nothing wrong with iltizaam 
    (clinging to the Ka’bah in this area) so long as that does not involve 
    annoying others.

Do we have to pay zakaah? Please note that we receive the rent in one payment, and we spend it before the year has passed.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    No zakaah is due on properties that are prepared for rental; 
    rather zakaah is due on the rent that is paid on them, subject to two 
    conditions: 

    1-That it reaches the minimum 
    threshold at which zakaah becomes due (nisaab)

    2-That one full hijri year has 
    passed (since acquiring it).

    The year starts from when you sign the contract, whether the 
    rent is paid in advance at the beginning of the year or at the end of the 
    year. If it was received at the beginning of the year and the year has 
    passed, then zakaah must be paid on it, or on what is left of it if some has 
    been spent and some is left. 

    If it is received at the end of the year then zakaah must be 
    paid on it, because one year has passed since the contract was signed. 

    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in 
    al-Mughni (4/271): 
If a person rents out 
    his house for two years for forty dinars, the rent is considered to have 
    come into his possession at the time of the contract, and he has to pay 
    zakaah on the whole amount when one year has passed. End quote. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked about a man who rented out some 
    property and received payment for one year in advance, and he used it to pay 
    off some debts – does he have to pay zakaah on this rent? 

    He replied: No zakaah is due on rent in such a case, where it 
    was received from the renter in advance and he used it to pay off a debt, 
    because a full year did not pass since it came into his possession. What 
    counts here is the date of the rental contact until the end of the year. If 
    he received the rent before the end of the year and used it to pay off a 
    debt or he spent it on things needed for the house, then no zakaah is due on 
    it. 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 
    14/177 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen 
    was asked about properties that are prepared for rent – is zakaah due on 
    them? 

    He replied: 

    No zakaah is due on these properties, because the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Muslim does not 
    have to pay zakaah on his slave or his horse.” Rather zakaah is due on the 
    rent, if one full year has passed since the contract was drawn up. 
For example: a man rents 
    out his house for ten thousand, and he receives ten thousand after one year 
    has passed; he has to pay zakaah on this ten thousand, because one year has 
    passed since the contract was drawn up. Another man rented out his house for 
    ten thousand – five thousand of which he received at the time of signing the 
    contract, and which spent within two months, and five thousand to be paid 
    halfway through the year, which he took and spent within two months. When 
    the year is over, he has nothing left of the rent, so no zakaah is due on 
    it, because it did not spend one full year in his possession, and zakaah is 
    only due if it has spent one year in his possession. End quote.

Conditions of Zakah on trade goods


How to calculate Zakah on trade goods","Praise be to Allah.Is there Zakah on business goods?
Zakah is due on trade goods according to the Quran and Sunnah. In the Quran, this is indicated by the general meaning of the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Spend of the good things which you have (legally) earned, and of that which We have produced from the earth for you.” [Al-Baqarah 2:267]
Mujahid said: “Spend of the good things which you have (legally) earned” means trade.  
With regard to evidence from the Sunnah, Abu Dawud narrated (1562) that Samurah ibn Jundub (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to command us to give Zakah from that which we had prepared for sale . 
The Isnad of this Hadith is subject to some discussion, but some of the scholars classed it as sound, such as Ibn `Abd Al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him), and it is the view that the scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas adopted. (See Fatawa Al-Lajnah Al-Da’imah, 9/331) 
Conditions of Zakah on trade goods
Zakah is due on things that have been prepared for trade if they reach the Nisab (minimum threshold) and one (lunar) year has passed (since they were acquired). 
How to calculate Zakah on trade goods
Based on this, Zakah must be paid on the land which has been in your possession for a year; you have to determine the value of the land at the end of the year, and pay one-quarter of ten percent . So if its value is one hundred thousand (100,000) Dinars, for example, you have to pay Zakah of 2.5% or two and a half thousand (2,500), and so on. 
What happens if you don't have cash to pay Zakah on trade goods?
If you have cash, then you must pay it and it is not permissible to delay paying Zakah until the land is sold . But if you do not have cash with which to pay the Zakah, then it becomes a debt that you owe and must be paid when it becomes possible to do so. If you cannot do it until you sell the land, then you have to pay Zakah from the price you receive for the land for each year in which Zakah was due. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Zakah is due on land that is prepared for trade. The evidence for that is the well-known Hadith of Samurah ibn Jundub (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to command us to give Zakah from that which we had prepared for sale.” 
He also said: 
“If land and other similar things such as houses and cars, etc. are prepared for sale, then you must pay Zakah on them each year according to their value, when one full (lunar) year has passed. It is not permissible to delay that, except in the case of one who is unable to pay the Zakah on them because he does not have any other wealth. Then he may be given a respite until he sells it and pays the Zakah for all the years, each year according to its value at the end of that year, regardless of whether the value is more than the price he gets for it or is less than the price for which he bought the land, car or house.""

Until now we have no idea what she looks like and we have not spoken a single word to her. Is this permissible according to sharee’ah or is it extreme?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    A woman has to cover her entire body, including the face, 
    from men who are strangers to her (i.e., non-mahrams). She should observe 
    hijab even more strictly in front of her husband’s male relatives who are 
    not mahrams for her than in front of strangers. This is the opposite of what 
    most careless people do nowadays. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said, when one of his companions wanted an exception to 
    allow the husband’s relatives to enter upon his wife: “The in-law is death.” 
    So we must be more cautious with regard to the husband’s relatives – 
    including his brothers – because of the carelessness that exists with regard 
    to this matter.

     Your brother has done well by not allowing his wife to 
    appear in front of you, and she has done well by obeying the command of 
    Allaah and of her husband. This is not extremism at all; rather it is 
    obedience to the command of Allaah. There is no need for the husband’s 
    brothers to see his wife, let alone sit with her and talk to her. 

    Those scholars who said it is permissible for a woman to sit 
    with her husband’s relatives only allowed it on condition that there is no 
    suspicion attached to that and that she does not sit alone with one of them, 
    or there is no listening to songs or watching haraam things on the part of 
    either of them. Unfortunately such things happen in most people’s 
    gatherings. If the gathering is free of the above-mentioned evils and haraam 
    things and the woman observes full hijab, then it is permissible for her to 
    sit with them and speak to them, so long as she is not soft in speech. But 
    it is still better and more on the safe side for her not to do that, and 
    this is what your brother has done, so that hearts may remain pure and free 
    of the traps by which the Shaytaan ensnares people. 

    What your brother has done should not have any effect on your 
    relationship with him or on the relationship of your wives with his wife. 
    They are doing something good and acting in accordance with Islam. You 
    should try to get close to them and learn from them in the way they deal 
    with people. You should note that your brothers’ criticizing their brother 
    for concealing his wife from them and not letting her sit with them makes 
    one have suspicions about them. In sha Allaah they are not that type of 
    people, but the Shaytaan may make something appear attractive to a man so 
    that what is good becomes bad to him, and what is bad becomes good, so he 
    regards covering and modesty as extremism and laxity as trust and progress. 
     

    We ask Allaah to purify our hearts and bodies, and to bring 
    you together in a good way, and to reconcile between you, and to make you a 
    good example to other people.

Sometimes (very rarely) I leave them doing nothing. 

I have another colleague who also, by Allaah’s grace, does not teach music to the students, and he does the same things with them as I do.

    end of time there will be people among my ummah who regard adultery, silk, 
    alcohol and musical instruments as permissible.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari. 
This hadeeth 
    clearly indicates that adultery, silk, alcohol and musical instruments are 
    haraam, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “They will regard as permissible” and regarding as permissible can 
    only come after something has been forbidden. 
The fuqaha’ 
    have stated in their chapters on buying and selling that it is haraam to 
    sell musical instruments. 
Music is 
    haraam, and so is working in this field, learning it and teaching it. The 
    money that is earned from that is haraam. May Allaah reward you for refusing 
    to teach this haraam subject to the students and teaching them something

    Allaah, and ask Him to open the hearts of the bosses so that they will 
    respond to your request. 
With regard 
    to the salary that you have earned: 
The basic

But seeing 
    as you are not doing this haraam work, and you are trying to benefit the 
    students, which is good for you and for them, we hope that there is no sin 
    in your taking this salary, in sha Allaah. You can form a good intention if

In their commentary on this hadeeth, the scholars said that this is to be understood as referring to seeing the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the physical form that is described in the saheeh ahaadeeth, for the Shaytaan cannot imitate the form of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
But if the Shaytaan comes in another form, whether one is asleep or awake, then lies and says, “I am the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him),” then this is false and does not count as seeing the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
So you should know the physical attributes of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Please see question no. 1512. These attributes have been mentioned in many ahaadeeth which describe his stature, his hands, his forearms, his mouth and teeth, his eyes and his hair – (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
There were many people who resembled the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Those who most resembled him were al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him), and ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Ja’far ibn Abi Taalib. So if you see the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the form that is narrated in the Sunnah, then you have truly seen him, but if you see him in a form that is other than that described in the Sunnah and the Seerah – such as if you see him clean-shaven, or missing a hand or foot – then there are two scholarly points of view in this case: 
1 – That this is indicative of a person’s shortcoming in religious commitment 
2 – The view that Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah thought more likely to be correct, which is that this is a false image that comes from the Shaytaan, especially if one sees it whilst awake. That is definitely a false image, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is alive in al-Barzakh and no one can see him whilst he is awake and he cannot visit anyone or speak to him. 
What some people claim, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to them when they were awake, and spoke to them and told them about things, this undoubtedly comes from the shayaateen (devils) and the jinn, especially since that did not happen to the greatest Sahaabah such as Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthmaan, ‘Ali, al-Zubayr, Talhah, ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Awf, Sa’eed ibn Zayd, Abu ‘Ubaydah and Sa’d, or the people who had been present at Badr or had given their bay’ah (oath of allegiance) beneath the tree, and other great and Allaah-fearing Sahaabah. If anyone claims that he saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) whilst he was awake, then undoubtedly the one who appeared to him was a devil or a jinn, and no ruling can be established from that. Something worse than that happened to Shaykh ‘Abd al-Qaadir al-Jilaani (may Allaah have mercy on him), when he saw someone sitting on a throne between heaven and earth, saying, “I am your Lord.” He said: “Be gone, enemy of Allaah, for you are Iblees.” He said: “How do you know that I am Iblees?” He said: “Because Allaah cannot be seen in this world until we die, and because you said, ‘I am your Lord’ but you did not dare to say, ‘I am Allaah.’” So visions of this sort come from the Shaytaan. We should not be deceived by the stories that are narrated by some people who are thought to be righteous, such as stories about seeing the Prophets and sitting with them. We may believe that they sat with them but with whom were they sitting? They sat with the jinn and devils so that that may cause fitnah (tribulation). But those whom Allaah protects by their following the Qur’aan and Sunnah and reciting dhikrs, Aayat al-Kursiy, al-Mi’wadhaat (the soorahs seeking refuge with Allaah) and seeking the help of Allaah, will be protected against that in sha Allaah, as happened with the awliya’ (close friends of Allaah) and those who fear Him – as was narrated by Shaykh al-Islam in his valuable book: al-Furqaan bayna Awliya’ al-Rahmaan wa Awliya’ al-Shaytaan. 
There remains another issue to which we must refer, which is that if a person sees the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the form described in the saheeh Sunnah, this is glad tidings, telling him that he will also see him when he is awake. If he tells him of some shar’i matter that seems to go against the apparent meaning of the Qur’aan and Sunnah, should he follow what he has been told or follow the apparent meaning of the Qur’aan and Sunnah? Or if he tells him about some matter concerning which there has to be proof – such as the people being shown the new moon when they did not see it, and he says that tomorrow is Ramadaan – should he follow that or not? Or if he tells him that So and so stole something from So and so, or that in the case of a dispute So and so is in the right – should he bear witness to that? 
The scholars have stated that if a person sees the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he tells him something that goes against the apparent meaning of the Qur’aan or Sunnah, or tells him of some matter concerning which there has to be proof, he should not act upon it, because what one sees in a dream is not binding; what is binding is the facts that one learns when awake. You should note that the dreams of the Prophets are wahy (revelation), but seeing the Prophets in a dream is not wahy – according to scholarly consensus. Rather it is bushra (glad tidings), as was explained by al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him).",Islam Q&A
47791,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47791,Used to Take Things From Work; What Now After Repentance?,"I am an employee in a government department. I used to take some pens, paper, paper clips and erasers home with me. After that Allah enabled me to repent and follow the right path, praise be to Allah. But what should I do about these things so that I may clear my conscience? Please note that I do not remember from which office I took them. What should I do?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    
    Allah has commanded us to keep our trusts, and He has forbidden us to take 
    people’s wealth or property in unlawful ways. 

    
    Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    
    “Verily, Allah commands that you should render back the trusts to those, to 
    whom they are due.” [4:58] 

    
    It was narrated that Abu Humayd al Sa’idi said: The Messenger of Allah 
    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By Allah, no one of you 
    takes anything unlawfully but he will meet Allah carrying it on the Day of 
    Resurrection. I will certainly recognize some of you who meet Allah carrying 
    a camel that is groaning or a cow that is lowing or a sheep that is 
    bleating.” Then he raised his hand until the whiteness of his armpit could 
    be seen and said: “O Allah, have I conveyed (the message)?” [al-Bukhari, 
    Muslim]. 
Who has enabled you to repent. This is a blessing from 
    Allah to you, for which He deserves to be thanked. So praise Allah and ask 
    Him for more of His bounty and help. 
    
    
    You do not have to disclose to the department what you have done; rather it 
    is sufficient for you to return the things themselves or the equivalent in 
    whatever way you can. If you cannot return them then you can give an 
    equivalent amount in charity. 

    
    You should try to find the office from which you took them; if you cannot do 
    that, then it is sufficient – in sha Allah – for you to return them to the 
    department itself. 

    
    The Standing Committee was asked about a man who used to work in the armed 
    forces and took a coat without permission. They replied: 

    
    You have to return something equivalent to the coat that you took or its 
    value to the section from which you took it. If you cannot, then give the 
    equivalent amount in charity to a poor person.
