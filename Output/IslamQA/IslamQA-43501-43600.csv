Then they found out that it was wrong. What is the ruling?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
If it was slightly off, then it does not matter. 
Secondly: 
If a person tries his best to find out the qiblah, whether by asking local people who appear to him to be sincere, or otherwise, then he has done what is required of him. If he finds out later on that it was wrong, his prayer is still valid and he does not have to repeat it.
 It says in al-Mughni by Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him): 
Whoever prays facing a certain direction after striving to work it out, then he finds out that he got the qiblah wrong, does not have to repeat it. In other words, if a person does his best to work out the direction and prays, then he finds out for certain that he prayed in a direction other than the direction of the Ka’bah, he does not have to repeat it, and the same applies to the one who follows him. This is the view of Maalik, Abu Haneefah and al-Shaafa’i, according to one of his two opinions.",Islam Q&A
43506,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43506,Answer to Questions About the Verses Which Speak of the Life of the Messiah (peace be upon him),"I am very interested in this site and I am a regular visitor to this site. I have great respect for you. Before going to my question I would like to say that I have no doubts about the holy Quran and I believed that not even a single letter of the Quran has been change. But I have some misunderstandings about these two verses. ""So peace is on me the day I was born, the day that I die, and the day that I shall be raised up to life (again)""! (Sura Maryam 33). The day that I die; what does this mean? And also this verse: And there is none of the People of the Book but must believe in him before his death; and on the Day of Judgment he will be a witness against them;- (An-Nisa 159). Before his death; what does this mean? But this verse: ""That they said (in boast), ""We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah"";- but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them, and those who differ therein are full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge, but only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killed him not:- (An-Nisa 157) "" Nay, Allah raised him up unto Himself; and Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise;- (An-Nisa 158). Right now I am studying in China. I have some friends from different faiths asking about the holy Quran and status of Jesus (pbuh) in Islam. I am trying my best to answer all their questions.",,,"Praise be to Allah.First of 
    all, we would like to thank you for your keenness to ask about matters of 
    your religion, and your efforts to understand the Book of Allaah, may He be 
    glorified and exalted. We ask Allaah to bless us and you with beneficial 
    knowledge. 
With regard 
    to the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“And 
    Salaam (peace) be upon me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day 
    I shall be raised alive!” 
[Maryam 
    19:33], 
al-Tabari 
    said in his Tafseer: The phrase “And Salaam (peace) be upon me the 
    day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive” 
    means: I was granted protection from Allaah against the Shaytaan and his 
    troops on the day I was born, so that they could not do to me what they do 
    any newborn, i.e. prick him. And on the day I die I shall be protected from 
    the terrors of death. And on the day I am raised alive on the Day of 
    Resurrection I shall be protected against the terror that will seize the 
    people when they see the horrors of that Day.” [Tafseer al-Tabari, 
    8/340]. 
Al-Qurtubi 
    said: “And Salaam (peace) be upon me” means protection that is 
    granted to me from Allaah, may He be exalted. Al-Zajjaaj said: Salaam was 
    mentioned before this without the definite article, and the second time it 
    was mentioned with the definite article. The phrase “the day I was born” 
    means, in this world. And it was said: from the suggestions of the Shaytaan. 
    The phrase “and the day I die” means in the grave. The phrase “and 
    the day I shall be raised alive” means, in the Hereafter, because he has 
    three stages: alive in this world, dead in the grave, and resurrected in the 
    Hereafter, and he is granted protection in all three. 
Tafseer 
    al-Qurtubi, 11/98. 
From the 
    comments of the mufassireen (commentators of Quran) quoted above it may be known that the phrase “and 
    the day I die” does not mean that he has died, rather it means that when 
    he dies – which will happen after he has descended and killed the Dajjaal, 
    as is proven in the ahaadeeth (prophetic narrations)– then he will be protected from dying without 
    belief in Allaah, may He be exalted. Similarly the words “and the day I 
    shall be raised alive” do not mean that he was raised on the Day of 
    Resurrection. Rather he was speaking about his situation at the time of his 
    birth, at the time of his death and at the time of his resurrection. 
    Undoubtedly he will die, but as is indicated by the other verses that you 
    quoted, he did not die by being killed or crucified, rather Allaah took him 
    up to Himself, and he will die after he descends from heaven and kills the 
    Dajjaal. 
With regard 
    to the verse in which Allaah says: 
“And 
    there is none of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) but must 
    believe in him [‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), as only a Messenger of 
    Allaah and a human being] before his [‘Eesa (Jesus) or a Jew’s or a 
    Christian’s] death (at the time of the appearance of the angel of death). 
    And on the Day of Resurrection, he [‘Eesa (Jesus)] will be a witness against 
    them”
[al-Nisa’ 
    4:159]
The scholars 
    differed as to whom the pronoun “his” in the phrase “his death” refers. 
    There are two views: 
1 – That the 
    pronoun refers to ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him), in which case the 
    meaning of the verse is: that there is no one among the people of the Book 
    but he must believe in ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) before he (‘Eesa) dies, 
    because when he descends from heaven and kills the Dajjaal, he will break 
    the cross and kill the pigs and abolish jizyah (tax paid by non-Muslims in an Islamic state), and he will accept nothing 
    but Islam, and at that time the People of the Book will believe in him, 
    before he dies (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him), and they will 
    know that he is true and that he did not die before then. So what is 
    mentioned in the verse is one of the signs of the Hour and one of the 
    portents of the Day of Resurrection, which will happen after the descent of 
    ‘Eesa; before he dies at that time, the People of the Book will believe in 
    him. There is support for this view in the comment made by Abu Hurayrah (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him) after he narrated the hadeeth which speaks of 
    the descent of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) at the end of time. It was narrated 
    that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “By the One in 
    Whose hand is my soul, soon the Son of Maryam will descend among you as a 
    just judge. He will break the cross and kill the pigs and abolish the 
    jizyah, and wealth will become so abundant that no one will accept it, and 
    one prostration will be better than this world and everything in it.” Then 
    Abu Hurayrah said: recite, if you wish: “And there 
    is none of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) but must 
    believe in him [‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), as only a Messenger of 
    Allaah and a human being] before his [‘Eesa (Jesus) or a Jew’s or a 
    Christian’s] death (at the time of the appearance of the angel of death). 
    And on the Day of Resurrection, he [‘Eesa (Jesus)] will be a witness against 
    them”[al-Nisa’ 4:159]
Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 3129; Muslim, 220. 
2 – That the 
    pronoun refers to the kitaabi (Jew or Christian) himself, in which case the 
    meaning of the verse is that there is no one among the people of the Book 
    but he must believe in ‘Eesa (peace be upon him), and that he is true, and 
    that he did not die. That is when he suffers the agonies of death and sees 
    realities and proofs. At the time of death, the kitaabi will know that what 
    he believed is false, but that faith will not benefit him at that point. 
Based on 
    both views mentioned above, there is no indication or suggestion in the 
    verse that ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) has died. Rather the words – according 
    to the first view – refer to a matter of the Unseen which will come to pass 
    in the future, because he (peace be upon him) will undoubtedly die, but that 
    will be after he has descended, as stated above. And according to the second 
    view, the phrase “before his death” refers to the death of the kitaabi 
    himself. 
Al-Tabari, 
    Ibn Katheer and other imams of tafseer (exegesis) regarded the first view as more 
    likely to be correct. Ibn Katheer said: With regard to the words 
    (interpretation of the meaning): “And there is none of the people of the 
    Scripture (Jews and Christians) but must believe in him [‘Eesa (Jesus), son 
    of Maryam (Mary), as only a Messenger of Allaah and a human being] before 
    his [‘Eesa (Jesus) or a Jew’s or a Christian’s] death (at the time of the 
    appearance of the angel of death). And on the Day of Resurrection, he [‘Eesa 
    (Jesus)] will be a witness against them”[al-Nisa’ 4:159], Ibn Jareer 
    said: The scholars of interpretation differed concerning the meaning of 
    that. “And there is none of the people of the Scripture (Jews and 
    Christians) but must believe in him [‘Eesa (Jesus)] before his death” 
    means, before the death of ‘Eesa. That means that all of them will believe 
    in him when he comes down to fight the Dajjaal, so all religions will become 
    one, which is the monotheistic religion of Islam, the religion of Ibraaheem 
    (peace be upon him). ... It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “And 
    there is none of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) but must 
    believe in him [‘Eesa (Jesus)] before his death” means, before the death 
    of ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him). … It was narrated that al-Hasan 
    said: “And there is none of the people of the Scripture (Jews and 
    Christians) but must believe in him [‘Eesa (Jesus)] before his death” 
    means, before the death of ‘Eesa, and by Allaah, he is alive with Allaah, 
    but when he descends they will all believe in him. … Ibn Jareer said: And 
    others said: That means before the death of the one who believes in the Book 
    (i.e., the Jew or Christian), because at that point (just before death) he 
    will now truth from falsehood because everyone upon whom death comes, his 
    soul does not come out until truth has been made distinct from falsehood 
    with regard to his religion. ‘Ali ibn Abi Talhah said, narrating from Ibn 
    ‘Abbaas concerning this verse: He said: No Jew will die until he believes in 
    ‘Eesa. … Ibn ‘Abbaas said: If his head is cut off, his soul will not come 
    out until he believes in ‘Eesa. … It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: The 
    Jew will not die until he bears witness that ‘Eesa is the slave of Allaah 
    and His Messenger. 
Ibn Jareer 
    said: The most likely of these opinions to be correct is the first one, 
    which is that no one of the People of the Book will be left after the 
    descent of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) but he will believe in him before the 
    death of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him). Undoubtedly what Ibn Jareer said is the 
    correct view, because it is what is meant from the context of the verses, 
    which state that what the Jews claim, that ‘Eesa was killed and crucified, 
    is false, as are the claims of the ignorant Christians who believed the 
    claims of the Jews. Allaah tells us that this is not what happened, rather 
    it was made to appear so to them, and they killed the look-alike and did not 
    realize that. But he (‘Eesa) was taken up to Him, and he is still alive, and 
    will descend before the Day of Resurrection, as is indicated in the 
    mutawaatir ahaadeeth. He will kill the false messiah (the Dajjaal) and will 
    break the cross and kill the pigs, and abolish jizyah, i.e., he will not 
    accept it from any of the followers of other religions, rather he will only 
    accept Islam or the sword. This verse tells us that all the people of the 
    Book will believe in him at that time, and not one among them will fail to 
    believe in him. Hence he said: “And there is none of the people of the 
    Scripture (Jews and Christians) but must believe in him [‘Eesa (Jesus)] 
    before his death” i.e., before the death of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him), 
    whom the Jews and the Christians who agreed with them claim that he was 
    killed and crucified, but on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness 
    against them, i.e., because of their deeds that he witnessed before he was 
    taken up into heaven and after he descends to the earth again. Tafseer 
    Ibn Katheer (1/762). 
It is 
    essential to note that debate with the Christians must be done on the basis 
    of knowledge and proof, so that you will not be a cause of people not 
    accepting the truth because of weak arguments. The Christians do not have 
    any sound proof at all, but they present specious arguments to distort the 
    truth and they confuse truth with falsehood. May Allaah grant us refuge from 
    the ways of the misguided.

43532,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43532,"Isnaad of the hadeeth, “Whatever Allaah has permitted in His Book is halaal” and the ruling thereon","My question is about a hadeeth – “Whatever Allaah has permitted in His Book is halaal, whatever He has forbidden is haraam, and whatever He was silent about is pardoned, so accept the pardon of Allaah, for Allaah was not forgetful. Then he recited this verse: ‘and your Lord is never forgetful’ [Maryam 19:64].” This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (5/325), and classed as hasan on p. 14 of Ghaayat al-Maraam. 

But according to the website al-Durar al-Sunniyyah many things were said about this hadeeth, such as: its isnaad is very weak (da’eef jiddan) although its meaning is sound; its isnaad is good; its isnaad is saheeh; it is saheeh mawqoof and may be regarded as hasan because of corroborating marfoo’ reports; its isnaad includes Sayf ibn Haroon al-Barjami who was classed as da’eef by a number of scholars, but Abu Na’eem classed him as thiqah (trustworthy); it is da’eef.

Narrated by 
    a number of scholars, all via Dawood ibn Abi Hind from Mak-hool from Abu 
    Tha’labah. 
They 
    differed concerning Dawood ibn Abi Hind. 
Hafs ibn 
    Ghiyaath narrated it in a mawqoof report as noted by al-Bayhaqi (10/12); 
    Yazeed ibn Haroon agreed with him as was mentioned by al-Daaraqutni in 
    al-‘Ilal (6/324). 
It was also 
    narrated by ‘Ali ibn Mas-har in a marfoo’ report as recorded by al-Bayhaqi

1 – There is 
    no proof that Mak-hool heard from Abu Tha’labah, This was stated by Abu 
    Shahr al-Dimashqi, Abu Na’eem al-Haafiz and others. 
2 – There is 
    a difference of opinion concerning his marfoo’ and mawqoof reports from Abu 
    Tha’labah. Some of them narrated it from Mak-hool from his words, but 
    al-Daaraqutni said in al-‘Ilal (6/324): What is more likely to be 
    correct is that they are marfoo’. He said: And this is more well known. End

Conclusion: 
    The isnaads of this hadeeth are not free of weakness, but can it be regarded 
    as strong when they are taken all together? 
Some of the 
    scholars were of this view. Al-Nawawi classed as hasan the hadeeth of Abu 
    Tha’labah, as it says in al-Adhkaar (505). It was classed as saheeh 
    by Ibn al-Qayyim in I’laam al-Muwaqqi’een (1/221) and by Ibn Katheer 
    in his Tafseer (1/405). Al-Albaani said in Tahqeeq al-Eemaan li 
    Ibn Taymiyah (43): It is hasan because of corroborating reports. 
Al-Albaani 
    classed as hasan the hadeeth of Salmaan al-Faarisi in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi 
    (1726). In al-Mishkaat (4156) it says: It is saheeh mawqoof, but it 
    may be classed as hasan because of marfoo’ corroborating reports. 
But others 
    are of the view that the severe weakness in the isnaads of this hadeeth 
    means that it cannot be regarded as strong when all its isnaads are taken 
    together. The hadeeth of Abu’l-Darda’ is plainly munqati’ (interrupted), the 
    hadeeth of Salmaan al-Faarisi is munkar and it is a mistake to regard it as 
    marfoo’ (attributable to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him)), and the hadeeth of Abu Tha’labah is munqati’ and there is some 
    dispute as to whether it is marfoo’. 
This report 
    from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) is saheeh, but it is his 
    words (not the Prophet’s). This was narrated by Abu Dawood (2800). 
Ibn Katheer 
    said in Irshaad al-Faqeeh (1/367): its isnaad is saheeh.  
It was 
    classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood and Mishkaat 
    al-Masaabeeh (4074). 
The general 
    meaning of the hadeeth is also established in the basic principles of Islam, 
    and is quoted and accepted by the scholars. 
Ibn 
    al-‘Arabi said in ‘Aaridat al-Ahwadhi (4/185): The meaning of this 
    hadeeth is proven in al-Saheeh. End quote. 
Abu Bakr ibn 
    al-Sam’aani said: This hadeeth is one of the basic principles of Islam. It 
    was narrated from some of them that he said: There is no single hadeeth of 
    the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    which sums up all the basic principles of Islam apart from the hadeeth of 
    Abu Tha’labah. End quote. 
Jaami’ 
    al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hikam (2/70). 
For more 
    information on the meaning of the hadeeth and commentary on it, see Ibn 
    Rajab’s commentary on this hadeeth in Jaami’ al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hikam, 
    commentary on hadeeth no. 30 (2/68-87). 
Secondly: 
It should be 
    noted that when the scholars rule that a specific hadeeth is sound or weak, 
    that may refer to a specific isnaad, and does not refer to the hadeeth with 
    all its isnaads. For example, a scholar may judge one of the isnaads to be 
    weak, then elsewhere he may judge another isnaad of the same hadeeth to be 
    sound. This is not a contradiction, rather it is based on a difference in 
    the isnaads in question. This is what happened in the case of Shaykh 
    al-Albaani when he spoke about the hadeeth under discussion here; he classed 
    it as saheeh when reported from Abu’l-Darda’, and he classed its isnaad as 
    da’eef in the reports of Salmaan al-Faarisi, but he classed it as hasan 
    because of corroborating reports, so it is hasan li ghayrihi in his view. 
    That is not a contradiction; rather it is in accordance with the principles 
    of the science of hadeeth. 
The Muslim 
    has to follow the truth as it appears to him after researching and striving 
    to find out what is correct (ijtihaad). If he is not able to engage in 
    ijtihaad, then it is sufficient for him to follow well known scholars whose 
    knowledge he trusts and who are trustworthy, and he should not pay any 
    attention to anyone else. This includes matters of hadeeth and fiqh.

    knows best.",Islam Q&A
43574,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43574,Should the person praying behind the imam say Sami’a Allaahu liman hamidah when rising from bowing?,"I read in a flyer that when finishing bowing, the imam and the one who is praying behind him should both say “Sami’a Allaahu liman hamidah (Allaah hears the one who praises Him)” then after that those who are praying behind the imam should say “Allaahumma Rabbana laka’l-hamd (O Allaah, our Lord, to You be praise).” This is different from what we grew up with, which is that the imam only should say “Sami’a Allaahu liman hamidah,” and those who are praying behind him should respond: “Allahummah Rabbana laka’l-hamd.”

 Please advise us, may Allaah reward you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Tasmee’ 
    (saying Sami’a Allaahu liman hamidah) when rising from bowing and 
    tahmeed (praising Allaah by saying Allaahumma Rabbana wa laka’l-hamd) 
    when standing up straight are Sunnah and are mustahabb according to the 
    majority of scholars. The Hanbalis are of the view that they are obligatory, 
    and the correct view is that they are obligatory. 
Shaykh Ibn 
    ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ 
    (3/433): 
The evidence 
    for that (i.e., that it is obligatory) is as follows: 
1 – The 
    Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) adhered to that 
    and did not neglect to say Sami’a Allaahu liman hamidah in all 
    situations. 
2 – It is 
    the signal for moving from bowing to standing. 
3 – The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When he says
    Sami’ah Allaahu liman hamidah, say Rabbana wa laka’l-hamd.” 
End quote. 
We have 
    listed tasmee’ and tahmeed as being among the obligatory parts of prayer in 
    question no. 65847. 
Secondly: 
The fuqaha’ 
    are unanimously agreed that the person who is praying alone should say both 
    tasmee’ and tahmeed. So he should say Sami’a Allaahu liman hamidah 
    when he rises from bowing and when he has stood up straight he should say 
    Rabbana wa laka’l-hamd. 
This 
    unanimous agreement was narrated by al-Tahhaawi in Sharh Ma’aani 
    al-Athaar (1/240) and Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr in al-Istidhkaar (2/178). 
But in 
    al-Mughni (1/548) there is something which indicates that there is a 
    difference of opinion on this matter. But they differed as to what is 
    prescribed for the imam and for the one praying behind the imam. 
In the case 
    of the imam: 
The Hanafis 
    and Maalikis are of the view that he should say tasmee’ only, and it is not 
    Sunnah for him to say Rabbana laka’l-hamd. The Shaafa’is and Hanbalis 
    are of the view that the imam should say both tasmee’ and tahmeed. 
The more 
    correct view is the latter one, because it was narrated that Abu Hurayrah 
    (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “When the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said Sami’a Allaahu liman 
    hamidah, he would say Allaahumma Rabbana wa laka’l-hamd.” 
Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari (795) and Muslim (392). 
Al-Haafiz 
    ibn Hajar stated that the fact that it is mustahabb for the imam to say 
    tahmeed may be understood from this hadeeth and others. 
See: Fath 
    al-Baari (2/367). 
In the case 
    of the one who is praying behind the imam: 
The majority 
    of scholars, Hanafi, Maaliki and Hanbali, are of the view that the person 
    praying behind the imam should limit himself to the tahmeed only, and he 
    should not say Sami’a Allaahu liman hamidah. 
The 
    Shaafa’is and Zaahiris (literalists) disagreed with them and said that it is 
    mustahabb for the person praying behind the imam to say both the tasmee’ and 
    the tahmeed. This is the view favoured by al-Albaani in Sifat al-Salaah 
    (135). For more information on their evidence please see the essay by 
    al-Suyooti in al-Haawi li’l-Fataawa (1/35). 
The more 
    correct view – and Allaah knows best – is that of the majority. 
Shaykh Ibn 
    ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Liqa’ al-Baab 
    il-Maftooh (1/320): 
When the 
    imam says Sami’a Allaahu liman hamidah, the one who is praying behind 
    him should not say Sami’a Allaahu liman hamidah, because the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The imam is 
    appointed to be followed, so when he says takbeer, then say takbeer, when he 
    bows, then bow, when he prostrates, then prostrate, and when he says 
    Sami’a Allaahu liman hamidah, then say Rabbana wa laka’l-hamd.” 
He said, 
    “When he says takbeer, then say takbeer,” and “when he says Sami’a 
    Allaahu liman hamidah, then say Rabbana wa laka’l-hamd”. Thus the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) differentiated 
    between the takbeer and the tasmee’. With regard to the takbeer, we say what 
    he says, but with regard to the tasmee’ we do not say what he says, because 
    his words “when he says Sami’a Allaahu liman hamidah, then say 
    Rabbana wa laka’l-hamd” are tantamount to saying: when he says Sami’a 
    Allaahu liman hamidah, do not say Sami’a Allaahu liman hamidah, 
    rather say Rabbana wa laka’l-hamd. This is based on the context of 
    the hadeeth in which he says, “When he says takbeer, then say takbeer.” As 
    for those scholars who say that he should say Sami’a Allaahu liman 
    hamidah and Rabbana wa laka’l-hamd, this is a weak argument. No 
    opinion should be accepted in all cases or rejected in all cases until it is 
    measured against the Qur’aan and Sunnah. When we measure it against the 
    Sunnah we see that it is as you heard. End quote. 
See: 
    al-Mughni (1/548), al-Umm (1/136), al-Muhalla (1/35), 
    al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (27/93-94). 
Thus it will 
    be clear to you that there is a difference of opinion among the scholars 
    concerning this issue, and it is not strange that some flyers will state the 
    view of some of the scholars.
