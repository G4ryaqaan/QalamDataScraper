20607,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20607,Family problems caused by husband’s brother,"I have a brother in law who is always at my house on the phone with my husband or pulling my husband to go out with him he can't seem to do anything without him, its gotten to the point where I cant stand to see him anymore. I feel he puts thoughts into my husbands head and he takes him away from his responsibilities to me and our three sons we have an active life with the three boys and I always get the short end I love to do things for them all but sometimes I'd like my husband to be with us but usually this means his brother will tag along or he'll constantly call untill he reaches us. I've had major fights with my husband because he thinks its ok to say no to me because I will understand and forgive him but his brother will pout for a long time. I think he should be more committed to us and not his brother if he wants us to survive as a family. As a muslim women, am I asking for to much or does his brothers feelings come first?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The husband has to understand that Allaah has 
    enjoined upon him to take care of his children, to bring them up properly and to look after their affairs. He has also enjoined upon him to treat 
    his wife in a good and kind manner. Allaah will question him about every shortcoming with regard to these duties on the Day of Resurrection. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and 
    your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from 
    executing) the Commands they receive from Allaah, but do that which they are commanded”
[al-Tahreem 66:6] 
“and live with them [women] honourably”
[al-Nisa’ 4:19]
Secondly: 
The husband should not allow into his life 
    anything that may come between him and his taking care of his family, such as working continually, or allowing friends or relatives to take all 
    his time or interfere in his family’s affairs. 
Nowadays the Muslim cannot find enough time 
    to do all the things that Allaah has enjoined upon him, so how can he waste his time with other things at the expense of these duties? 
Thirdly: 
The wife should not try to come between her 
    husband and his family. She should not complain about him visiting them or their visiting him, unless he is giving that priority over the duties 
    that Allaah has enjoined upon him. 
The father should not give anyone priority 
    over his children, whether that is his brother or any other relative. Hence there is no need to cause a split and break the family ties between 
    your husband and his brother, or between the children and their paternal uncle, because that will have a far-reaching effect on their 
    relationships with other people and with their relatives. 
Fourthly:
    We advise you to be kind and gentle towards your husband, and to show him that you have nothing against his relationship with his brother. Do not 
    cause your children to dislike him. 
If you see any shortcoming on your husband’s 
    part with regard to his shar’i duties towards you, then denounce that and remind him in a manner that is better, without being too harsh. You can 
    do that by hinting rather than stating it bluntly, unless there is a need for that.  
We have seen similar cases in some families 
    where the wife had another member of her family staying with them for some reason.  So we think that the husband’s treatment of his family will 
    get better if he sees his wife treating his family in a better manner.

Is belief in the unseen an article of faith?


Belief in the Omnipotence of Allah","Praise be to Allah.How tall was Adam (peace be upon him)?
This hadith was narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: 
“Allah created Adam and he was sixty cubits tall. Then He said, ‘Go and greet those angels and listen to how they greet you, for that will be your greeting and the greeting of your progeny.’ He said, ‘Al-salamu ‘alaykum (Peace be upon you).’ They said, ‘Al-salamu ‘alaykum wa rahmat-Allah (Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah).’ So they added the words ‘wa rahmat Allah.’ And everyone who enters Paradise will be in the form of Adam. People kept on growing smaller until now.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3336; Muslim, 7092) 
According to a version narrated by Muslim: “Everyone who enters Paradise will be in the form of Adam who was sixty cubits tall. People kept growing smaller until now.” 
With regard to the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “People kept growing smaller until now,” al-Hafiz ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Bari (6/367): “This means that in every generation people grew shorter than the previous generation, and continued to grow shorter until the time of this ummah, then they stayed like that.” 
The Muslim is obliged to believe in every idea for which there is evidence in the Quran or sahih Sunnah from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Imam al-Shafi'i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “I believe in Allah and in that which came from Allah in the sense meant by Allah. I believe in the Messenger of Allah and in what came from the Messenger of Allah in the sense meant by the Messenger of Allah.” See al-Irshad Sharh Lam’at al-I’tiqad, p. 89. 
So the believer is required to believe with firm faith in everything that we are told by Allah and by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), if it is proven to be soundly reported from him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He must believe in it with firm faith that leaves no room for the slightest doubt. He must accept it in general and specific terms, whether he understands it or not and whether he finds it strange or not, because not understanding something that is proven in a sound report does not mean that it did not happen. All that means is that he cannot comprehend this particular issue. Allah has commanded us to believe in everything that He tells us and everything that His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) tells us. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Only those are the believers who have believed in Allah and His Messenger, and afterward doubt not but strive with their wealth and their lives for the Cause of Allah. Those! They are the truthful” [al-Hujurat 49:15]
Is belief in the unseen an article of faith?
Part of faith is belief in the unseen (al-ghayb). The hadith we are discussing here comes under this heading. Allah praises those who believe in the unseen, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Alif-Lam-Mim. [These letters are one of the miracles of the Quran and none but Allah (Alone) knows their meanings.]
This is the Book (the Quran), whereof there is no doubt, a guidance to those who are Al-Muttaqun [the pious believers of Islamic Monotheism who fear Allah much (abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which He has forbidden) and love Allah much (perform all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained)].
Who believe in the Ghayb[the unseen].” [al-Baqarah 2:1-3]
Belief in the Omnipotence of Allah 
You should note that Allah is Able to do all things. Just as He is able to create man in the form that he appears in now, He is also able to create man in a larger or smaller form. 
If this is difficult for you to understand, then think of the dwarves that we see, who are child-sized men. If this can happen, then why could the opposite not happen, namely a man being sixty cubits tall? In the history of mankind there have been giants as the archaeologists tell us. 
The basic principle here is to accept the absolute power of Allah and to accept what He tells us and what His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) tells us, and to say what those who are well versed in knowledge say: 
“We believe in it; the whole of it (clear and unclear Verses) are from our Lord.”  [Al 'Imran 3:7 – interpretation of the meaning].
We ask Allah to show us the truth as true and help us to follow it, and to show us falsehood as false and help us to avoid it.

20613,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20613,Why did Allah create the heavens and the earth in six days when He is able to have created it in less time?,"If Allah intends a thing, his only word is ""BE"" and it is. can you please explain why he took 6 days to create the heavens and earth?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.One of the firm beliefs held by people of deep faith and complete Tawheed is that the Lord, may He be exalted, is able to do all things, and His power is without limits. He has absolute power, perfect will and ultimate control of all affairs. If He wills a thing, it happens as He wills it at the time when He wills it, and in the manner that He wills. 
There are many definitive texts in the Book of our Lord and in the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which affirm this and state it clearly, with no ambiguity. It is sufficient here for us to quote some of the verses that indicate this, such as the verses (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The Originator of the heavens and the earth. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it : ‘Be!’ — and it is”
[al-Baqarah 2:117]
Al-Haafz Ibn Katheer said in his commentary on this verse (Tafseer 1/175): “Here Allah explains the completeness of His power and the greatness of His authority, and that if He wills and decrees something, He simply says to it, ‘Be!’ – just once – and it is, i.e., it comes into existence as He willed it. This is like the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘Verily, His Command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, “Be!” —  and it is!’
[Ya-Seen 36:82].” 
And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“When He has decreed something, He says to it only: ‘Be!’ — and it is” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:47]
“It is He Who gives life and causes death. And when He decides upon a thing He says to it only: ‘Be’ —  and it is” [Ghaafir 40:68]
“And Our Commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye” [al-Qamar 54:50]
Al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer said in his commentary on this verse (4/261): “Here Allah tells us how His will is executed in His creation, and how His decree is implemented. ‘And Our Commandment is but one’ means, We only issue a command once, and We do not need to repeat it a second time, and what We command happens in the twinkling of an eye, it is not delayed for an instant. How well the poet put it: 
‘When Allah wills something, all He says to it is “Be!”, once, and it is.’” 
And there are many other verses which speak of this matter and explain it. 
Once this is established, then why did Allah create the heavens and the earth in six days? 
Firstly: 
It is narrated in more than one verse of the Book of our Lord that Allah created the heavens and the earth in six days. For example, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Indeed, your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days, and then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty)”
[al-A’raaf 7:54]
 Secondly: 
There is nothing that Allah does but there is great wisdom in it. This is one of the meanings of Allah’s name al-Hakeem (The Most Wise). Allah may or may not show this wisdom to us, and those who have deep knowledge may understand it, to the exclusion of others. 
But the fact that we may not know or understand this wisdom should not make us deny it or object to the rulings of Allah, or try to ask too much about this wisdom that Allah has hidden from us. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
“He [Allah] cannot be questioned as to what He does, while they will be questioned”
[al-Anbiya’ 21:23]
Some scholars have attempted to explain the reason why the heavens and the earth were created in six days: 
1 – Imam al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Jaami’ li Ahkaam al-Qur’aan, commenting on al-A’raaf 7:54 (4/7/140):
 “Allah mentions this period – i.e. six days – although if He had wanted to create it in an instant, He could have done so, because He is Able to say to it ‘Be!’ and is. But He wanted to: 
-Teach His slaves kindness and deliberation in their affairs.
-Manifest His power to the angels step by step.
-And there is another reason: He wanted to create it in six days because Allah has decreed a course for everything, for which reason He He delays the punishment for the sinners, because everything has an appointed time with Him.”
2 – Ibn al-Jawzi said in his tafseer called Zaad al-Maseer (3/162), commenting on the verse in Soorat al-A’raaf: 
“If it is said, why did He not create it in an instant when He is Able to do so? There are five answers to this question: 
(i)He wanted to create something each day to show His power to the angels and those who witnessed it. This was suggested by Ibn al-Anbaari.
(ii) He was preparing things for Adam and his offspring before Adam existed, to emphasize Adam’s high standing before the angels.
(iii) Doing things in a short time is more indicative of power, and deliberation is more indicative of wisdom. Allah wanted to manifest His wisdom in that, just as He manifested His power when He said, ‘ “Be!” And it is.’
(iv) He taught deliberation to His slaves, because if the One Who does not make mistakes created the universe in a deliberate manner, then it is more appropriate for those who are vulnerable to making mistakes to do things in a deliberate manner.
(v) Creation was accomplished step by step, lest anyone think that this happened as the result of an accident of nature.
3 – al-Qaadi Abu’l-Sa’ood said in his commentary on the verse in al-A’raaf (3/232):  
“The fact that Allah created things in stages although He is able to have created everything in one go is indicative of the Divine Will and is a sign of His power for those who understand, and it encourages deliberation in all things.”
And he said in his commentary on al-Furqaan 25:59 (6/226): 
“The One Who created these great stars in this precise configuration in stages, even though He is able to create them in one go, (that was) for a great reason and sublime purpose, which human minds cannot comprehend fully.”  
Based on the above, it is clear that Allah has absolute power, ultimate will and perfect control, and He has wise reasons for everything that He creates, which no one knows but He, may He be exalted. Now you can understand some of the reasons why Allah created the heavens and the earth in six days when He is able to have created them simply by saying “Be!”.

20620,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20620,Reciting Quran in the bathroom,Is it permissible to recite the holy quran while in the toilet?( without taking the book itself in).,,,"Praise be to Allah.The Quran is the best book that mankind has ever known, because it is the Word of the Lord of the Universe, which was brought down by the trustworthy Spirit [i.e., Jibreel] to the heart of the noble Messenger, to bring mankind forth from darkness into light, and guide them to the straight path. It is the Book whose miracle abides, the proof of which is constantly renewed; Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it, (it is) sent down by the All Wise, Worthy of all praise (Allah) [cf. Fussilat 41:42]
There are kinds of etiquette that have to do with this Book, to which attention should be paid when reciting it. One of these rules is that the place where it is recited should be clean. In his valuable book al-Tibyaan, Imam al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned some of the etiquette which the Muslim should pay attention to when reciting the Book of Allah. He mentioned the issue of reciting Quran in bathrooms and toilets, and he quoted the views of scholars on this matter. He said:
“It is mustahabb to recite Quran in a place that is clean and suitable. Hence a number of scholars regarded it as mustahabb to read Quran in the mosque because it is both clean and a honourable environment… With regard to reciting Quran in the bathroom, the salaf differed as to whether it is makrooh. Our companions – i.e., the Shaafa’is – said that it is not makrooh. This was quoted by Abu Bakr ibn al-Mundhir in al-Ishraaf from Ibraaheem al-Nakha’i and Maalik, and it is the view of ‘Ata’.
Some regarded it as makrooh, such as ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him). This was narrated from him by Ibn Abi Dawood.
Ibn al-Mundhir narrated from a group of the Taabi’een – including Abu Waa’il Shaqeeq ibn Salamah, al-Shu’bi, al-Hasan al-Basri, Makhool, Qubaysah ibn Dhu’ayb, and from Abu Haneefah (may Allah be pleased with them all) that al-Shu’bi said: it is makrooh to recite Quran in three places: bathrooms, toilets …. It was narrated that Abu Maysarah said: Allah should not be remembered except in good (clean) places.”
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
Is it permissible to remember Allah (dhikr) in the bathroom?
He replied:
A person should not remember his Lord inside the bathroom, because this place is not appropriate for that. If he remembers Him in his heart there is nothing wrong with that, but he should not utter the words out loud. It is better not to speak the words out loud in this place, and to wait until he has come out of it.
With regard to places for doing wudoo’ that are outside the toilets where one relieves oneself, there is nothing wrong with remembering Allah there.

20642,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20642,Does committing a sin openly put a person beyond the pale of Islam?,"Is it kufr to commit a sin openly and discuss about sinful activities such as movies, songs etc? Does this rule apply to both major as well as minor sins? Please pay attention to this question, as a number of our brothers and sisters who have newly inclined towards Islam are facing this problem.",,,"Praise be to Allah.One of the things concerning which there can be no doubt is the fact that committing acts of disobedience and major sins openly is sin upon sin which may lead a person to kufr at the time of committing that sin openly, because he takes the prohibition on that lightly and is proud of what he is doing. There is no difference between major and minor sins with regard to this ruling.  
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “All of my ummah may be forgiven except those who commit sin openly. It is a kind of committing sin openly if a man does something at night, then morning comes and Allaah has concealed his sin, but he says, ‘O So and so, I did such and such last night,’ when his Lord has concealed him (his action) all night but in the morning he reveals that which Allaah had concealed for him.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5721; Muslim, 2990 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:  
… There is a third type of immoral, prmiscuous evildoer, who speaks of zina with pride (Allaah forbid), and speaks of how he traveled to such and such a land, and committed immoral actions and adultery with a number of women, and so on, and he boasts about that. 
This person should be asked to repent; if he repents all well and good, otherwise he should be executed, because if a person boasts about committing zina, this implies that he regards zina as being permissible (Allaah forbid), and whoever regards zina as permissible is a kaafir. 
Sharh Riyaadh al-Saaliheen, 1/116 
Undoubtedly there are varying degrees of disobedience, and the level of sin varies according to the person’s state of mind whilst committing the sin and afterwards. The one who conceals his sin is not like one who commits sin openly. The one who regrets it afterwards is not like one who boasts about it. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
In conclusion, evil actions vary according to their consequences. Those who have boyfriends or girlfriends commit a less serious sin than those who commit immoral actions with anyone; the one who commits sin in secret is doing something less serious than one who commits sin openly and broadcasts it. The one who keeps quiet about it commits a less serious sin than one who tells people about it. Such a one is far removed from the forgiveness of Allaah, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “All of my ummah may be forgiven except those who commit sin openly…” 
Ighaathat al-Lahfaan, 2/147 
The basic principle is that the Muslim should follow his sin with repentance and seeking forgiveness; he should regret what he has done and resolve never to go back to it. He should not follow it with boasting and speaking openly about it. 
Ahmad (8792) and al-Tirmidhi (3334) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If the believer commits a sin, a black spot appears on his heart. If he repents, gives it up and seeks forgiveness, his heart is cleansed, but if he does more then (that spot) increases until it covers his heart. That is the raan (covering of sin) which Allaah mentioned in the Qur’aan: 
“Nay! But on their hearts is the Raan (covering of sins and evil deeds) which they used to earn”""
[al-Mutaffifeen 83:14]
Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2654 
There remains one issue that was mentioned in the question, which is the committing of sin openly by those who are new in Islam. Those people are still unaware of the rulings of Islam, so they are excused if they do not know the shar’i rulings, but they should be taught. So strive to teach them, and show them this answer.

20646,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20646,"The time for naming the child and slaughtering the ‘aqeeqah, and eating therefrom","Can the parents of a child eat from the sacrifical meat of their child's Aqiqa,and is it necessary to sacrifice and shave the child's head on the same day?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
It is permissible for the parents to eat from 
    the ‘aqeeqah, because ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said concerning the ‘aqeeqah: “It should be divided into portions (judool), 
    some of which should be eaten and some given to others.” Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf, 5. 
The author of al-Qaamoos said: “Jadl 
    (pl. judool) means every bone that is separated at the joints and not broken, and not mixed with anything else.” Al-Qaamoos al-Muheet, 
    p. 975, al-Risaalah edition. 
Shaykh Muhammad Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Judoolan means complete bones, so the bones should not be broken, rather they should be separated at the 
    joints.” See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 7/545.

It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah 
    (11/443): “The person who has an ‘aqeeqah may distribute it raw or cooked to the poor, neighbours, relatives and friends, and he and his family 
    may eat some of it. He may invite rich and poor people and feed them in his house, and so on. The matter is broad in scope.” 
Secondly: 
The Sunnah is to shave the child’s head on 
    the seventh day, and to slaughter the ‘aqeeqah on the same day, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Every 
    child is in pledge for his ‘aqeeqah, which should be slaughtered on his behalf on the seventh day, when he should be named and his head shaved.” 
    Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1522; Abu Dawood, 3838; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 1165. 
If the child is named or the ‘aqeeqah 
    slaughtered on a day other than the seventh, there is nothing wrong with that, or with slaughtering the ‘aqeeqah on one day and shaving the 
    child’s head on a different day. 
Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: “With regard to 
    shaving the child’s head at the time of the ‘aqeeqah, the scholars regarded that as mustahabb.”

When he created him he said, ‘Go and greet that group of angels who are sitting and listen to how they greet you, for that will be your greeting and the greeting of your descendents.’ So he said, ‘Al-salaamu ‘alaykum (peace be upon you),’ and they said, ‘Al-salaamu ‘alayka wa rahmat-Allah (Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah.’ So they added (the words) ‘wa rahmat-Allah.’ Everyone who enters Paradise will be in the form of Adam, but mankind continued to grow shorter until now.” 
Muslim (2612) narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of fights his brother, let him avoid the face, for Allah created Adam in His image.” 
Ibn Abi ‘Aasim narrated in al-Sunnah (517) that Ibn ‘Umar said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not say ‘May Allah deform your face’ [a form of cursing in Arabic], for the son of Adam was created in the image of the Most Merciful.” Shaykh ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Ghunaymaan (may Allah preserve him) said: “This hadith is saheeh and was classed as such by the imams and by Imam Ahmad and Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh. Those who classed it as da’eef have no evidence, except for the view of Ibn Khuzaymah, but those who classed it as saheeh are more knowledgeable than him. 
Ibn Abi ‘Aasim also narrated (516) that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you fights let him avoid the face, for Allah created Adam in the image of His Face.” Shaykh al-Albaani said: its isnaad is saheeh. 
These two hadith indicate that the pronoun in the phrase “in His image” refers to Allah, may He be glorified. 
Al-Tirmidhi (3234) narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “My Lord came to me in the most beautiful image and said, ‘O Muhammad.’ I said, ‘Here I am at Your service, my Lord.’ He said, ‘What are the chiefs (angels) on high disputing about…’” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
According to the lengthy hadith about intercession, it says, “… then the Compeller (al-Jabbaar) will come to then in an image different than the image in which they saw Him the first time…” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 7440; Muslim, 182. 
From these ahaadeeth we learn that it is proven that Allah has an image (soorah in Arabic), in a manner that befits Him, may He be glorified and exalted. His image is one of His attributes which cannot be likened to the attributes of created beings, just as His essence cannot be likened to their essence. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: “The word soorah (image) in this hadith is like all the other names and attributes narrated (in the texts) where the words used may also be applied to created beings, in a limited manner. When these words are applied to Allah, they carry a unique meaning, such as al-‘Aleem (All Knowing), al-Qadeer (All-Powerful), al-Raheem (Most Merciful), al-Samee’ (All Hearing), al-Baseer (All-Seeing), and such as His creating with His hands, rising above the Throne, etc.” Naqd al-Ta’sees, 3/396 
 Everything that exists must inevitably have a form or image. Shaykh al-Islam said: “Just as everything that exists must have attributes that, so too everything that exists by itself must have a form or image. It is impossible for something that exists by itself not to have a form or image.” 
And he said: “There was no dispute among the salaf of the first three generations that the pronoun in the hadith refers to Allah, and it is narrated through many isnaads from many of the Sahaabah. The contexts of the ahaadeeth all indicate that… but when al-Jahamiyyah became widespread in the third century AH, a group began to say that the pronoun refers to something other than Allah, and this was transmitted from a group of scholars who are known to have knowledge and to follow the Sunnah in most of their affairs, such as Abu Thawr, Ibn Khuzaymah, Abu’l-Shaykh al-Asfahaani and others. Hence they were denounced by the imams of Islam and other Sunni scholars.”  
Naqd al-Ta’sees, 3/202 
Ibn Qutaybah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “That Allah should have an image is no stranger than His having two hands, fingers or eyes. Rather those are readily accepted because they are mentioned in the Qur’aan, but this idea (image or form) is regarded as strange because it is not mentioned in the Qur’aan. But we believe in them all, but we do not discuss how any of them are.” 
Ta’weel Mukhtalif al-hadith, p. 221 
Shaykh al-Ghunaymaan said: “Thus it is clear that the form or image is like all the other divine attributes. Any attribute which Allah has affirmed in the Revelation, we must affirm it and believe in it.” 
Sharh Kitaab al-Tawheed min Saheeh al-Bukhari, 2/41 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: There is a hadith narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in which he forbids saying “May Allah deform your face”, and says that Allah created Adam in His image. What is the correct belief with regard to this hadith? 
He replied: 
This hadith is proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), in which he said: “If any one of you strikes (another), let him avoid the face, for Allah created Adam in His image.” According to another version: “In the image of the Most Merciful.” This does not imply resemblance or likeness. 
What is meant, according to the scholars, is that Allah created Adam with the ability to hear and see, and to speak when he wants. These are also attributes of Allah, for He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing, and He speaks when He wants, and He has a Face, may He be glorified and exalted. 
But it does not mean that there is any resemblance or likeness. Rather the image of Allah is different from that of created beings. What is meant is that He is All-Hearing, All-Seeing, and He speaks when He wants, and He created Adam also able to hear and see, with a face and hands and feet. But man’s hearing is not like Allah’s hearing, his seeing is not like Allah’s seeing, his speaking is not like Allah’s speaking. Rather Allah has attributes that befit His majesty and might, and man has attributes that befit him, attributes that are finite and imperfect, whereas the attributes of Allah are perfect, with no shortcomings, infinite and without end. Hence Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“There is nothing like Him, and He is the All‑Hearer, the All‑Seer” [al-Shoora 42:11] 
“And there is none co‑equal or comparable unto Him” [al-Ikhlaas 112:4]
So it is not permissible to strike the face or say “May Allah deform your face”. 
End quote. Majmoo’ Fatawa al-Shaykh, 4/226 
Another thing that will help to explain the meaning of this hadith is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “The first group to enter Paradise will be in the image of the moon” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3245; Muslim, 2834.” What the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) meant here is that the first group will be in human form, but because of their purity, beauty and brightness of face they will look like the moon, so they are likened to the moon, but without resembling it. So just because a thing is said to be in the image of a thing it does not mean that it is like it in all aspects. 
The Prophet’s words, “Adam was created in His image” means that Allah created Adam in His image, for He has a face, an eye, a hand, and a foot, and Adam had a face, an eye, a hand, and a foot… but that does not mean that these things are exactly the same. There is some similarity, but it is not exactly the same. Similarly the first group to enter Paradise are likened to the moon, but they are not exactly the same. This confirms the view of Ahl al-Sunnah wa'l-Jamaa'ah, who say that none of the attributes of Allah can be likened to the attributes of created beings, without distorting or misinterpreting, or discussing how or likening Him to His creation.

Discussion of the hadith about the virtues of making hajj every five years


How scholars interpreted the hadith about virtues of making hajj every five years","Praise be to Allah.Hadith about the virtues of making hajj every five years
The text of the hadith: 
It was narrated from Abu Sa’id al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah says: ‘A person whose body I make healthy and to whom I grant ample provision but five years go by and he does not come to Me is indeed deprived.’” (Narrated by Abu Ya’la, 2/304; al-Bayhaqi, 5/262)
Discussion of the hadith about the virtues of making hajj every five years
Some of the scholars have discussed this hadith. Some of them – such as Ibn al-‘Arabi al-Maliki – were of the view that it is mawdu’ (fabricated). Others classed it as da’if, such as al-Daraqutni, al-‘Aqeeli and al-Subki. Ibn Hibban and Shaykh al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Sahihah (1662) are of the view that it is sahih. 
How scholars interpreted the hadith about virtues of making hajj every five years
Some of the scholars have interpreted this hadith as referring to Hajj or ‘Umrah . Based on this, al-Haythami included this hadith in his book Mawarid al-Zam-an under the heading “Chapter concerning one who is well off but does not go for Hajj or ‘Umrah in five years.”  (Mawarid al-Zam-an, p. 239) 
Others interpreted it as referring to Hajj only, as al-Mundhiri included it in his book al-Targhib wa’l-Tarhib under the heading, “Warning to one who is able to do Hajj but does not go for Hajj .” 
Some of the scholars quoted this hadith as evidence that it is obligatory to perform Hajj once every five years for the one who is able to do that. This is a weak view, either because the hadith is weak (da’if) and not sahih, or because the hadith is to be understood as referring to what is mustahabb, not what is obligatory. 
Al-Subki said: 
The scholars are agreed that Hajj is an individual obligation upon every accountable, free Muslim who is able to do it, once in his or her lifetime, except for very few scholars who held different views, who said: It is obligatory once every five years, and they based that view on the report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every Muslim should come to the House of Allah every five years.” This was narrated by Ibn al-‘Arabi. We say: Narrating this hadith is haram, so how can a ruling be established based on it? 
Al-Daraqutni said: “It was narrated through more than one isnad, none of which are sahih at all.” (Fatawa al-Subki, 1/263) 
Al-Hattab said: 
“Some of those who held an odd view said that it is obligatory every year, and it was narrated from some of them that it is obligatory every five years, because of the report according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every Muslim should come to the House of Allah every five years.” Ibn ‘Arabi said: Narrating this hadith is haram, so how can a ruling be established based on it? Meaning that it is mawdu’ (fabricated). Al-Nawawi said: This idea is contrary to the consensus of the scholars, so this odd view is to be rejected on the basis of the consensus of the scholars who came before those who held this odd view. 
Even if we accept this hadith, then it is to be understood as meaning that it is mustahabb.” (Mawahib al-Jalil, 2/466)

But when a person lives a distance away from the Masjid at what distance is he not required to go to the masjid for every prayer?
Example, if it took someone one hour per trip to the masjid and back to work or home. (That is 20 minutes to go to masjid, 20 minutes at masjid and 20 minutes back to work or home.) Also this is the only masjid in the city.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
It is obligatory for men to attend the prayer in congregation in the mosque. Not praying in congregation is one of the signs of hypocrisy. 
The further away one’s house is from the mosque, the greater the reward. 
It was narrated that Abu Moosa said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The people who will have the greatest reward for prayer are those who come the furthest distance. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 623; Muslim, 622. 
Secondly: 
Prayer in congregation is obligatory for those who live close to the mosque, not for those who live far away.  
The Sunnah describes those who are regarded as living close to the mosque as being those who can hear the call to prayer. 
What is meant is those who can hear the call to prayer from the mosque with no amplification of the muezzins’s voice, when the muezzin raises his voice, and there is no wind or noise etc to interfere with hearing it. 
Muslim (653) narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: A blind man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of Allah, I do not have anyone to guide me to the mosque,” and he asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to grant him a concession allowing him to pray in his house, and he granted him that. Then when he turned to leave, he called him back and said, “Can you hear the call to prayer?” He said, “Yes.” He said, “Then respond to it.” 
Ibn Maajah (793) narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever hears the call to prayer and does not respond, there is no prayer for him (i.e., his prayer is not valid), except for the one who has an excuse.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 637. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmoo’, 4/353: 
What is meant by hearing the call to prayer is when the muezzin stands at the edge of the town and other sounds are silent and the wind is still, and one is listening out. If a person can hear him, he is obliged (to attend prayers in congregation), and if he cannot hear him then he is not obliged. 
The Standing Committee was asked: If I can hear the muezzin from a distance of eight hundred meters, should I pray where I am or go to the mosque where the call to prayer was made? 
They replied: 
You have to go to this mosque and pray there with the congregation, or in any other mosque that may be easier for you, so long as you are able to do that… then the Committee quoted as evidence the two ahaadeeth mentioned above. 
The Committee was also asked about a man who lives on the eighth floor and the mosque is about 500 meters away from him. Is it permissible for him to offer the prayers in congregation with his family members in his apartment? 
They replied: 
Congregational prayer in the mosque is obligatory, so you have to attend the mosques and pray the obligatory prayer there with the Muslims. You do not have the right to a concession allowing you to pray at home with your family because of this distance. 
Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 8/59 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked: 
Is there any definition of the distance between one’s house and the mosque? 
He replied: 
There is no specific distance defined in sharee’ah, rather that depends on ‘urf (custom) or the distance within which the adhaan can be heard without a microphone. 
As’ilah al-Baab al-Maftooh, question no. 700. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz said: 
The one who can hear the call to prayer given in a regular voice without amplification is obliged to respond and to come and pray in congregation in the mosque in which the call is given… 
But for those who live far away from the mosque and cannot hear the call to prayer except with amplification do not have to come to the mosque. They and those who are with them may pray in a separate congregation. If they take the trouble to attend the prayer with the congregation in the mosque whose call to prayer they cannot hear except with amplification because they are too far away, that will bring them a greater reward.

20661,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20661,Is Vowing Part of Repentance?,"Do we have any chance of being forgiven if we do not vow to never repeat the sin again?

I'm asking this because, if you think that you will most probably do it again, is there a point in vowing not to repeat the haram (forbidden) action (knowing that to break a promise to Allah constitutes fasting for 3 days)?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    
    No sin is too great for Allah to forgive, no matter what this sin is, so 
    long as the person has repented from it. Allah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    
    “Say: O ‘Ibadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by 
    committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, 
    Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful.” 
    [39:53] 

    
    The door of repentance is open so long as death has not come to a person, 
    and so long as the sun has not begun to rise from the west. 

    
    It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The 
    Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah 
    accepts the repentance of His slave so long as the death rattle has not yet 
    reached his throat.” [Ahmad, al-Tirmithi]

    
    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The 
    Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever 
    repents before the sun rises from the west, Allah will accept his 
    repentance.” [Muslim]

    
    So the Muslim should make the most of this opportunity and this great bounty 
    from Allah, and hasten to repent so long as there is still time; he should 
    not delay his repentance. 

    
    But this repentance has to be sincere, as Allah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    
    “O you who believe! Turn to Allah with sincere repentance! It may be that 
    your Lord will expiate from you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under 
    which rivers flow (Paradise) the Day that Allah will not disgrace the 
    Prophet (Muhammad) and those who believe with him. Their Light will run 
    forward before them and (with their Records, Books of deeds) in their right 
    hands. They will say: ‘Our Lord! Keep perfect our Light for us [and do not 
    put it off till we cross over the sirat (a slippery bridge over Hell) 
    safely] and grant us forgiveness. Verily, You are Able to do all things.’” 
    [66:8] 

    
    The scholars have stated that sincere repentance is that which meets five 
    conditions: 

    
    1-     It should be sincerely for the sake of Allah.

    
    2-     There should be real regret for sins committed in the past, and the 
    person should wish that he had never done them.

    
    3-     He should give up the sin immediately. If the sin consists of doing 
    something haram (unlawful), he should stop doing it at once. If the sin 
    consists of not doing something that is obligatory, he should start to do it 
    at once. If the sin has to do with people’s dues, his repentance is not 
    valid unless he gives them those dues.

    
    4-     He should resolve never to go back to that sin in the future.

    
    5-     That it should not come after the time when repentance is accepted[U1] , 
    as stated above.

    
    See Majalis Shahr Ramadhan by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen. 

    
    Hence we know that it is not one of the conditions of repentance that one 
    should not repeat the sin, rather the condition is the sincere resolve not 
    to repeat it. If a person repents from a sin that he used to commit, then 
    the shaytaan (devil) toys with him and makes him go back to it – there is no 
    power and no strength except with Allah – he should not despair of the mercy 
    of Allah. He should repent once again and Allah will accept it, for Allah’s 
    bounty and forgiveness are immense.  

    
    It was narrated from Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari (may Allah be pleased with him) 
    that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah 
    spreads out His hand at night to accept the repentance of those who 
    committed sin during the day, and He spreads out His hand during the day to 
    accept the repentance of those who committed sin during the night (and this 
    will continue) until the sun rises from the west.” [Muslim] 

    
    It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that he 
    heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: 
    “A person committed a sin and said, ‘O Lord, I have sinned; forgive me.’ His 
    Lord said: ‘Does My slave know that he has a Lord Who forgives sin and 
    punishes for it? I have forgiven My slave.’  Then as much time as Allah 
    willed passed, and he committed the sin again. He said, ‘O Lord, I have 
    sinned; forgive me.’ His Lord said: ‘Does My slave know that he has a Lord 
    Who forgives sin and punishes for it? I have forgiven My slave.’  …” 

    
    [al-Bukhari, Muslim] 

    
    But the wise Muslim should be sincere towards Allah in his repentance, and 
    sincerely resolve not to repeat the sin, and regret what he has done in the 
    past. His repentance should not merely be words that are spoken by his lips 
    when the rest of his faculties pay no heed; that is the repentance of 
    liars. 

    
    With regard to making vows not to commit this sin again, there is no need 
    for that. Sincere repentance is that which fulfils the conditions mentioned 
    above. 

    
    It remains to comment on that which the questioner mentioned about the one 
    who breaks his vow having to fast for three days. This is not always the 
    case. Rather what the one who breaks his vow has to do is to free a slave, 
    or feed or clothe ten poor persons. If he cannot do any of these things, 
    then he has to fast for three days, but fasting is only an option if he is 
    unable to do any of the three other things, as is indicated by the verse in 
    which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    
    “Allah will not punish you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He 
    will punish you for your deliberate oaths; for its expiation (a deliberate 
    oath) feed ten Masakeen (poor persons), on a scale of the average of that 
    with which you feed your own families, or clothe them or manumit a slave. 
    But whosoever cannot afford (that), then he should fast for three days. That 
    is the expiation for the oaths when you have sworn. And protect your oaths 
    (i.e. do not swear much). Thus Allah makes clear to you His Ayat (proofs, 
    evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) that you may be 
    grateful.” [5:89]

Do they fight each other like humans, have categories (i.e. like ours in terms of blacks, Europeans, this country, that country, etc.), are they affected by natural things like rain, winds, earthquakes, etc.?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The jinn are part of the creation of Allah, and they are His slaves who are accountable and subject to commands and prohibitions, just like human beings. There are believers, disbelievers and evildoers among them. Those of them who do good will enter Paradise and those who do evil will deserve to be punished. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).” [51:56] 
And Allah says concerning the jinn (interpretation of the meaning): 
“‘There are among us some that are righteous, and some the contrary; we are groups having different ways (religious sects).’” [72:11] 
“And of us some are Muslims (who have submitted to Allah, after listening to this Quran), and of us some are al‑Qasitoon (disbelievers those who have deviated from the right path). And whosoever has embraced Islam (i.e. has become a Muslim by submitting to Allah), then such have sought the right path.
And as for the Qasitoon (disbelievers who deviated from the right path), they shall be firewood for Hell.” [72:14, 15] 
With regard to their being accountable and subject to commands and prohibitions, the scholars are unanimously agreed that they are accountable. Some of the scholars suggested that the accountability to which they are subject to is exactly the same as that to which human beings are subject to, whilst others suggested that their accountability is in accordance with their abilities and capabilities. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
They are enjoined concerning basic matters and minor issues according to their nature; they are not like human beings in essence and reality, so the commands and prohibitions to which they are subject to are not like those to which humans are subject to, but they have in common with humans, the fact that they are subject to commands and prohibitions, and rulings on what is permitted and what is forbidden. Concerning this I know of no dispute among the Muslims. End quote. Majmoo’ al-Fatawa. 
With regard to their lives and dwelling places, they are like all other creatures, they have their own lives, they get married and produce offspring. Allah says of Iblis (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Will you then take him (Iblis) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me while they are enemies to you?” [18:50] 
With regard to their dwellings, they often gather in ruins and unclean places like toilets and garbage dumps. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “These toilets are haunted (inhabited by devils), so when anyone of you goes to the toilet let him say, ‘A’oodhu Billahi min al-khubthi wa’l-khabaith (I seek refuge with Allah from the male and female devils).” [Abu Dawood].
With regard to the phrase al-khubthi wa’l-kabaith (translated above as “male and female devils”), it has been suggested that al-khubth may mean evil and al-khabaith may mean evil spirits, which includes both male and female devils. 
There is no doubt that the jinn die, for they are included in the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Whatsoever is on it (the earth) will perish.” [55:26]
It should be noted that the world of the jinn is the world of the unseen, and we do not know anything about it except that which Allah has told us in His Book or on the lips of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Based on this, we cannot say anything about them except that which has been narrated in the texts of Islam; anything other than this is hidden from us. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And follow not (O man, i.e., say not, or do not, or witness not) that of which you have no knowledge. Verily, the hearing, and the sight, and the heart of each of those ones will be questioned (by Allah)” [17:36] 
For more information on this topic, see the book ‘Alim al-Jinn wa’l-Shayateen by Dr ‘Umar Sulayman al-Ashqar. 
[Translator’s note: this book is available in English under the title The World of the Jinn and Devils in the Light of the Quran and Sunnah, published as Vol. 3 of the Islamic Creed Series by the International Islamic Publishing House, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.] 
It should be noted that Allah has given us information about the jinn and other creatures for our benefit, and what He has concealed from us we do not need to know. If knowing it was essential for us, Allah would have told us. Hence we should not concern ourselves with such matters or look into the mysteries of the jinn which can only be known through revelation. 
What a person should ask about is his religion, its acts of worship and beliefs, what he should do, and other important matters which have been enjoined or forbidden, so that he can be a true slave of Allah. 
In the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) we have a good example. They did not ask the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about such matters in which there is no benefit in knowing and no harm in not knowing.

Al-Kaasaani said in Badaa’i’ al-Sanaa’i’ 
    (5/128): 
There is nothing wrong with enemas because 
    that is a kind of medical treatment, and it is something that is recommended because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “Seek medical treatment, O slaves of Allaah, for Allaah does not send down any disease but He also sent down the cure, apart from death and 
    old age.” 
Narrated by Ahmad, 17987; Abu Dawood, 3855; 
    classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 3264. 
Al-Sarkhasi said in al-Mabsoot, 
    10/156: 
With regard to looking at the ‘awrah, that is haraam… but if there is a reason for doing so, 
    there is nothing wrong with looking at the ‘awrah for a necessary purpose. That includes: 
When a woman is giving birth, (her 
    attendants) may look at the vagina and other parts of the woman’s body. 
Similarly a man may look at the site where an 
    enema is given, when necessary. 
In the case of sickness, there is a necessary reason, and an enema is a kind of medical 
    treatment. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Seek medical treatment, O slaves of Allaah, for Allaah does not 
    send down any disease but He also sent down the cure, apart from death and old age.” And it was narrated that Abu Yoosuf suffered from emaciation 
    so it was said to him: An enema will relieve you of the emaciation you are suffering. So there is nothing wrong with showing that area to the 
    person performing the enema. This is correct, because extreme emaciation is a kind of sickness. 
Al-Mirdaawi said in his footnote to 
    al-Furoo’ (2/171): 
Is it makrooh to have an enema, whether that 
    is necessary or not? Then he said: The correct view is that it is not makrooh, rather it is permissible if there is a need, but it is makrooh if 
    there is no need…. Al-Marroodhi said: It was prescribed for Abu ‘Abd-Allaah – i.e., Imam Ahmad – and he did it, i.e., an enema.

20673,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20673,The middle hour,"I was reading the Signs of Last Hour in the below Islamic website. I came across a Hadith given in the website which is as follows : 
[Some Ahadith report that the Prophet was asked about the Hour. He looked towards a young boy and said, ""If he lives, he will not grow very old before he sees your Last Hour coming to you."" By this he meant their death and entering the Hereafter, because everyone who dies enters the Hereafter; some people say that when a person has died, his judgment has begun. This Hadith with this meaning is ""correct"" (Sahih)]  
Does that Hadith means that the Last Hour will begin before the young boy turns old. Please advise if the above interpretation of Hadith as mentioned in the website is right or not. I am quite confused so kindly elaborate the true meaning of this Hadith.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This hadeeth has been narrated in al-Saheehayn in several versions, such as that narrated by al-Bukhaari (6146) and Muslim (2952) from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) who said: “Some tough men among the Bedouin came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and asked him when the Hour would be. He would look at the youngest of them and say: ‘If this one lives, old age will not catch up with him until your Hour begins.’” Hishaam [one of the narrators of the hadeeth] said: This means their death.
The hadeeth is quite clear: what is meant is that the Hour of these people, i.e., their death, was something that was close at hand, and would happen when this youngster grew old. This hadeeth does not refer to the greater Hour which is the Day of Resurrection.
Al-Qaadi said: What was meant by “your Hour” was their death; it meant that that generation would die, or that those who were being addressed would die.
Quoted from Sharh Muslim by al-Nawawi.
Al-Karmaani said: This answer was very wise, i.e., it was a wise way of telling them not to ask about the time of the greater Hour, for no one knows that except Allaah; rather they should ask about the time when their generation would come to an end; it is more appropriate to know this because it will motivate you to keep doing righteous deeds before it is too late, because none of you knows who will die before the other.
Al-Raaghib al-Isfahaani said: The word saa’ah (hour) means a portion of time and is used to refer to the Resurrection, to indicate that the Reckoning will be very swift. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“and He is the Swiftest in taking account”
[al-An’aam 6:62]
Or it may indicate the meaning stated in the following verse (interpretation of the meaning):
“On the Day when they will see that (torment) with which they are promised (i.e. threatened, it will be) as if they had not stayed more than an hour in a single day”
[al-Ahqaaf 46:35]
The word saa’ah is used to refer to three things: al-saa’ah al-kubra (the greater Hour), which is when the people will be resurrected to face the Reckoning; al-saa’ah al-wusta (the middle Hour) which is the death of a generation; and al-saa’ah al-sughra (the lesser hour) which is a person’s death. So the Hour of each person is his death.

20695,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20695,What should be done with interest?,"I am working in a company where they gave to employees a few years ago a mount of money they put in a blocked account for 5 years. This amount of money is with interest and they give it to you after 5 years or when you give your resignation.  

I know it is haram but we did not have any choice.  

I am going to leave the company in a few month, and I would like to know how I have to do with this money. Can I keep what they gave me initially and give the amount of interest os saddakka ? Can you please help me, because I do not want to commit a sin.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The money that you are going to take after 
    five years will be composed of the capital – which is the money paid by the company – and the riba-based profits – which are known as interest. 
    Because riba-based money is not permissible for you, you have no right to take any more than the capital, and you have to leave the interest to 
    the bank, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but if you repent, you shall have your 
    capital sums”
[al-Baqarah 2:279]

If the bank insists on your taking this
