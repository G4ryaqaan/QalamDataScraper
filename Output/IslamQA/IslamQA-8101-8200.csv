      the Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas (al-Lajnah
      al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Iftaa’). The text
      of the question was as follows:
Al-Ummah
      magazine has published a fatwa on financial matters conducted in western
      countries and in daar al-harb [non-Muslim countries which are in a
      state of hostility against Islam]. Imaam Abu Haneefah stated that it was
      permissible to take riba from al-harbiyeen in daar al-harb,
      and that every contract or transaction which was beneficialto Muslims was valid, so long as it was based on mutual consent and
      involved no deception or betrayal. If this is true, it would be helpful to
      some Muslims in France, because the donations that come to us stay in the
      bank for months before the time comes to use them, and no one benefits
      from the accumulating interest apart from the bank with which we are
      dealing. If this fatwa is correct we can make use of the interest paid to
      us on our money in daar al-harb, and at least give it to the poor and
      needy, if no one else. And our intention is for the sake of Allaah.
 The Standing
      Committee, under the leadership of Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may
      Allaah have mercy on him) replied as follows:
 Firstly, financial
      transactions and mutual exchanges of benefits between us and the kuffaar
      are valid so long as they meet the conditions of transactions set out in
      Islamic sharee’ah.
 Secondly, dealing in
      ribaa is absolutely haraam, whether it is among Muslims or between Muslims
      and kaafirs, whether they are harbiyeen or not. And Allaah knows
      best.","From Fataawaa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 13/19"

8185,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8185,Advice to those who visit chat rooms,"There are now a large number of chat sites and there are many people who participate in them. What advice can you give to those who visit chat rooms, whether to read or to join in?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, 
          there are indeed many chat rooms on the Internet, and many people who 
          visit them. There follow some points of advice for those who read them 
          and those who write on them. 
 -Sincerity towards Allaah. 
          Every person will die and what he writes during his lifetime will remain. 
          So strive not to write anything except things that you will be pleased 
          to see on the Day of Resurrection. There is no good in doing anything 
          that is not intended to please Allaah. 
-The ordinary person who 
          is not a specialist has to choose sites that are sound and useful, and 
          avoid the sites of the followers of bid’ah and bad sites. 
-Boycott sites of the people 
          of bid’ah and sites which mostly contain bid’ah, because participation 
          and discussion are the lifeblood of these sites. It is not permissible 
          to promote the people of bid’ah; we must cause their names to die out 
          and strive to prevent them from becoming well known. The reaction of 
          some of the Ahl al-Sunnah may have the opposite effect. It is not permissible 
          for the ordinary Muslim to read the sites of the people of bid’ah with 
          the motive of just looking or of discussing without knowledge. He should 
          leave it to those who are qualified to deal with it. There is nothing 
          wrong with his telling the scholars about what the innovators are saying, 
          then transmitting the scholars’ response. 
-Reminding the owners of 
          “mixed-up” sites (sites which indicate confusion between Sunnah and 
          bid’ah) of Allaah and of the fact that it is not permissible for them 
          to allow innovators or authors of false opinions to spread those views 
          through their site. 
-The seekers of knowledge 
          (students of sharee’ah) have to support their brothers who have taken 
          on the task of refuting the people of bid’ah who rely on their large 
          numbers; if one of them writes something, ten others applaud and praise 
          him, and condemn the one whose view he is refuting. 
-It is important for shaykhs, 
          writers and well-known people to take part in these groups. 
-It is not essential for 
          the scholar to join in directly. That may take up too much of his time. 
          It is sufficient for some of his trustworthy students to convey information 
          from him. 
-Beware of wasting time. 
          Many students have let these chat rooms take up too much of their time. 
          It is not necessary to refute every single bleat and every single foolish 
          notion. It is sufficient to note the advice of the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Part of a man's being 
          a good Muslim is that he should leave alone that which does not concern 
          him.” 
-Being aware of the importance 
          of spending time in teaching the Muslims and that calling them to Allaah 
          takes priority over refuting this one and that one. Let us leave these 
          refutations for situations where it is essential, such as when one of 
          the people of bid’ah stirs up doubts or says something false and no 
          one else is refuting him – in that case someone has to refute him. 
-The person who enters chat 
          rooms has to realize that he is dealing with a large number of unknown 
          persons and that the margin of trust when dealing with people who are 
          not using their real names is very thin indeed. 
-We advise the enthusiastic 
          youth not to indulge in matters of which they do not have knowledge. 
          Regarding the matter of giving fatwas without knowledge, it is sufficient 
          for us to note the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning) 
“And on the Day of Resurrection 
          you will see those who lied against Allaah (i.e. attributed to Him sons, 
          partners)   
          their faces will be black” [al-Zumar 
          39:60] 
-Adhere to the etiquette 
          dictated by Islam and restrain the tongue (and the pen or writing is 
          regarded as one of the two “tongues”). Allaah says (interpretation of 
          the meaning): 
“And say to My slaves (i.e. the true believers 
          of Islamic Monotheism) that they should (only) say those words that 
          are the best. (Because) Shaytaan (Satan) verily, sows a state of conflict 
          and disagreements among them. Surely, Shaytaan (Satan) is to man a plain 
          enemy” [al-Israa’

8189,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8189,Who has more right to custody in Islam?,"After a marriage that lasted for a few years, a man divorced his wife and tried to take the child from her. She is asking who has more right to custody of the child, her or her ex-husband? Especially since she is going to travel to live with her family in another city.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Women have more right to custody of children than men; in principle custody belongs to them, because they are more compassionate and more kind, and they know better how to raise small children, and they are more patient in dealing with the difficulties involved. The mother has more right to custody of her child, whether it is a boy or a girl, so long as she does not re-marry and so long as she meets the conditions of custody. This is according to scholarly consensus.
The conditions of custody are: being accountable (i.e., an adult of sound mind etc.), being free (as opposed to being a slave), being of good character, being a Muslim if the child concerned is a Muslim, and being able to fulfil all obligations towards the child. The mother should not be married to a person who is a stranger (i.e., not related) to the child. If one of these conditions is not fulfilled and there is an impediment such as insanity or having remarried, etc., the woman forfeits the right to custody, but if that impediment is removed, then the right to custody is restored. But it is best to pay attention to the interests of the child, because his rights come first.
The period of custody lasts until the age of discretion and independence, i.e., until the child is able to discern what is what and is independent in the sense that he can eat by himself, drink by himself, and clean himself after using the toilet, etc.
When the child reaches this age, the period of custody ends, whether the child is a boy or a girl. That is usually at the age of seven or eight.
With regard to the effect of travelling on transferring custody, if the parents have separated and are disputing custody, any of the following scenarios may apply to their travelling:
1 – If one of the parents wants to travel without moving, i.e., he or she intends to come back, then the parent who is staying put has more right to the child.
2 – If one of them wants to travel for the purpose of settling there, and the new city or the route is dangerous, then the parent who is staying put has more right to the child.
3 – If one of them wants to move and settle within the same city, and the city and the route is safe,the father has right to the child than the mother, regardless of whether the one who is moving is the father or the mother.
4 – If both parents want to travel to the same place, then the mother should retain custody.
5 – If the place is nearby so that the father and child may see one another every day, then the mother should retain custody.
When the child reaches the age of independence, the period of custody comes to an end, and the period of kafaalah or sponsorship of the young begins, which lasts until the child reaches adolescence or in the case of a girls, starts her periods. Then the period of sponsorship ends and the child is free to make his own choices.
Women’s rights to sponsor children. It appears from the comments of the fuqaha’ that women have the right to sponsor children in general, and that mothers and grandmothers in particular have this right.  But the scholars differed as to who has more right to sponsorship if the parents are in dispute and are both qualified to sponsor the child. The Maalikis and Zaahiris think that the mother has more right to sponsorship of the child, whether it is a boy or a girl. The Hanbalis think that boys should be given a choice, but the father has more right in the case of a girl. The Hanafis think that the father has more right in the case of a boy and the mother has more right in the case of a girl. Perhaps the correct view is that the child should be given a choice if the parents are disputing and they both fulfil the conditions for sponsorship.","From Wilaayat al-Mar’ah fi’l-Fiqh al-Islami, p. 692"
8190,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8190,Guardianship over a woman’s marriage and wealth,"We know that if a woman wants to get married, she has to have a wali (guardian) who will do the marriage contract on her behalf. But how does she decide who will be her wali? Does the wali have to take care of all the woman’s dealings? Please advise us, may Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The ways in which a man may be appointed as a woman's wali for marriage 
          are five: being her owner (if she is a slave); being related to her; 
          being her patron (as when one tribe is patron of another, etc.); being 
          a leader (of the community, etc.); and guardianship (wisaayah).  
          The wali is one of the conditions of the validity of a marriage. It 
          is not permissible for a woman to be a wali in marriage either for herself 
          or for someone else for any reason; she cannot act as a wali for herself, 
          on behalf of another or as the deputy of another. If she does that, 
          the marriage contract is invalid.  
A woman who is adult, of sound mind and sensible has the right to manage her 
          own money and to dispose of it however she wishes, whether that is in 
          return for something or not, such as buying and selling, renting, lending, 
          giving in charity or giving gifts, giving all or part of the money. 
          No one has the right to stop her doing that, and she does not need anyone’s 
          permission, whether she is virgin who has a father, or does nit have 
          a father, or is married with a husband.  
It is permissible for a mother to dispose of her children’s wealth, food or 
          otherwise, as is also permissible for the father. It is also permissible 
          for a woman to dispose of and eat from her parents’ wealth with regard 
          to things that are permissible for her.  
The mother has the right to guardianship over the wealth of her children who 
          are still young or who are insane, because she is more compassionate 
          towards her child than anyone else.  
A woman does not have the right to dispose of her husband’s wealth or give any 
          of it in charity without his permission, whether that permission is 
          explicit or is implied by custom and habit.  
It is permissible for a woman to have the position of guardianship (wasiyah) 
          over someone else’s money and she may be in control of money over which 
          she has been appointed guardian, so long as she meets the conditions 
          of guardianship, whether she is the mother of the children or is not 
          related to them.  
It is permissible for a woman 
          to be in charge of a waqf; she has the right to be the guardian in charge 
          of a waqf and to decide how it should be disposed of. This is according 
          to scholarly consensus.","Wilaayat al-Mar’ah fi’l-Fiqh al-Islami, p. 691"
