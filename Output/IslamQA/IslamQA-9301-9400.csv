What benefits the dead?","Praise be to Allah.Reciting al-Fatihah for the deceased
There is no evidence for reciting al-Fatihah or any other part of the Quran and giving (the reward for) it to the deceased. We must not do that, because it was not narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) did any such thing. 
What benefits the dead?
It is prescribed to make du`a for the deceased Muslims and to give charity on their behalf by giving to the poor and needy. In this way, a person may draw closer to Allah and ask Him to give the reward for that to his father, mother or other people, deceased or alive. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When a man dies, all his deeds come to a halt apart from three: ongoing charity (sadaqah jariyah), beneficial knowledge or a righteous child who will pray for him .”  
A man said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “O Messenger of Allah, my mother has died and she did not make a will. I think that if she had spoken she would have given in charity. Will she be rewarded if I give in charity on her behalf?” He said, “Yes.” (Sahih – agreed upon) 
The same applies to Hajj and `umrah on behalf of the deceased and paying off his debts . All of these actions will benefit him, as was narrated in the shar’i evidence. But if the questioner is referring to treating the family of the deceased person kindly by giving them money or meat (i.e., food), there is nothing wrong with that if they are poor.
And Allah knows best.","Majmoo’ Fatawa wa Maqalat Mutanawwi’ah li Samahat al-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allah ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him), vol. 9, p. 324"
9307,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9307,Those who pray on chairs in the mosque,We often see chairs in the mosques which have been put there for people to pray on during obligatory prayers behind the imaam or during Taraaweeh prayers. What is the ruling on these people’s prayer?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Standing is an essential part of the prayer, and if a person does not stand during the prayer, from the initial takbeer to the final salaam, and has no valid excuse for that, his prayer is invalid. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And stand before Allaah with obedience” [al-Baqarah 2:238].
The rule that standing is an essential part of the prayer applies especially to the fard (obligatory) prayers; it is not obligatory to stand in the naafil prayers, in which sitting is permitted, but the one who sits will have half of the reward of one who stands.
The evidence that this rule applies only to the fard prayers is the hadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Pray standing.” (al-Bukhaari, 1066).
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray naafil prayers (sitting) on a saddle, but when he wanted to pray a fard prayer, he would get down off his saddle (al-Bukhaari, 955; Muslim, 700), so that he could fulfil the essential conditions of the prayer, i.e., standing and facing the qiblah.
If a person prays a naafil prayer sitting, when he is able to stand, he will have half of the reward of one who stands. ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar narrated that he said to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “I was told, O Messenger of Allaah, that you said that the prayer of one who prays sitting down is equal to half of the prayer of one who prays standing, but you pray sitting down.” He said, “That is right, but I am not like one of you.” (From the hadeeth narrated by Muslim, 735).
Al-Nawawi said, commenting on this hadeeth: this hadeeth is to be understood as meaning that a naafil prayer done sitting down when one is able to stand will bring half of the reward of one who prays standing. But if a person prays a naafil prayer sitting down because he is unable to stand, his reward will not be reduced, and he will have the same reward as one who prays standing. With regard to Fard prayers, if a person prays sitting down when he is able to stand, his prayer will not be valid and he will not get any reward for it, in fact this is counted as a sin. (Sharh Muslim. 6/258)
So we say to those who sit on the chairs and do not stand during the fard prayers: it is not permissible for you to sit on your chairs when you are able to stand, unless it would be so difficult for you as to cause harm, but a slight difficulty is no excuse.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
9310,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9310,Permissibility of following the imaam from behind the door of the mosque,"The nature of the place in which we pray is such that when it gets full, we close the door, and some people pray outside the prayer-place, following the imaam by hearing his voice on the loudspeakers. Is their prayer valid even though they are outside the mosque?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It 
          was narrated that Zayd ibn Thaabit (may Allaah be pleased with him) 
          said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was staying in a hut made of palm 
          leaves. He prayed in that hut and some men followed him, they came and 
          prayed with him. And in the hadeeth in which this incident is described, 
          it says: “The best prayer of a man is prayers offered in his house, 
          except for the obligatory prayers.” (Agreed upon) 
 This 
          hadeeth indicates that it is permissible to follow the imaam even if 
          he is in a room where the person following him cannot see him, or if 
          one of them is on the roof and the other is in a lower place. The point 
          is that if it is possible to follow the imaam if they are all inside 
          the mosque, there is no dispute among the scholars that it is permissible 
          for him to do so. 
 The 
          hadeeth also indicates that the presence of a barrier between the imaam 
          and the members of the congregation does not mean that the prayer and 
          their following the imaam are invalid. Al-Nawawi said: “For their following 
          to be valid, the person following has to know when the imaam moves, 
          whether they are praying in the mosque or elsewhere, or one of them 
          is in the mosque and the other is outside – this is according to scholarly 
          consensus.” 
 If 
          one of them is outside the mosque and he can see the imaam or other 
          members of the congregation, even if the rows are interrupted, the prayer 
          is valid because there is nothing to make it invalid and there is something 
          to make it valid – which is that he can see either the imaam or some 
          of the people behind him, and he is able to follow the prayer. 
 In 
          al-Insaaf it says: with 
          regard to the continuity of the rows, reference should be made to al-‘urf 
          (local custom, i.e., what is traditionally regarded as being complete), 
          according to the correct view. 
 It 
          says in al-Mughni: interruptions 
          (in the rows) do not matter. This is the view of Maalik and al-Shaafa'i, 
          because there is no limit in that, since it does not prevent following 
          the imaam. What matters here is what would prevent a person from seeing 
          or hearing the imaam. Al-Nawawi made it a condition that there should 
          not be big gaps outside the mosque, which is the view of the majority 
          of scholars. And Allaah knows best.","From Tawdeeh al-Ahkaam min Buloogh al-Maraam by ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Bassaam, p. 251"
9317,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9317,What is wrong with saying “the will of the people is part of the will of Allaah”,"I read in some books written by thinkers the phrase, “The will of the people is part of the will of Allaah.” I hope you can tell me how correct this saying is.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Doosari (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about this phrase, and he answered as follows:
This is a serious fabrication which some theorists and those who implement their ideas have dared to utter; nothing of this nature was ever spoken in the kaafir environments of past centuries. The worst that was said in the past was when they used the will of Allaah as an excuse, as Allaah tells us (interpretation of the meaning):
“Those who took partners (in worship) with Allaah will say: ‘If Allaah had willed, we would not have taken partners (in worship) with Him, nor would our fathers, and we would not have forbidden anything (against His Will).’”
[al-An’aam 6:148]. Allaah showed them to be liars, but these philosophers attribute to the so-called people the will to do whatever they want, in order to justify the plans which they want to carry out. We must confront this evil lie in order to prove that it and the motives of those who say this are false, because on the basis of their corrupt idea the people will be allowed to do whatever they want and conduct their affairs in such a way that there will be no restrictions laid down by the sharee’ah and the Book, only those that suit their whims and desires, or are based on their materialistic interests and physical desires, or their power – like the kaafir peoples who do not follow the religion of Allaah and do not care about morality or virtue.
Not even Abu Jahl and his ilk, as evil and stubborn as he was, dared to utter this lie, because the abhorrence of this lie is obvious to anyone who has common sense. People’s tastes and inclinations vary, so if the will of the people is regarded as being part of the will of Allaah, this would mean that all kinds of trends such as existentialism, communism, nazism, zionism, the law of the jungle and others are also part of the will of Allaah that He enjoins upon people. Then all the things that evil souls desire and sick hearts love, such as promiscuity, immorality, drinking alcohol and fulfilling physical desires at the expense of others would also be a part of the will of Allaah.
So why do they criticize and condemn others for it, if the will and desires of the people are part of the will of Allaah concerning the rulings that He likes? Why would Allaah send Messengers and reveal Books, and enjoin jihaad, and issue commands and prohibitions to the people, if their will is part of His will that He likes?
This is impossible; it is the ultimate immorality and misguidance.  Those who make this claim do not apply it to themselves, rather they use it as permission to suppress the people who do not submit to their power or act according to their plans.
It is as if the people whom they are ruling with an iron fist are the people whose will is divine and is part of the will of Allaah.
Falsehood is inevitably self-contradictory, and points out its own false nature. This is an action of major shirk, because they have made the people rivals to Allaah, and they have made their desires rivals to His sharee’ah and wisdom, instead of subject to Allaah’s rulings and adhering to His limits, content with and implementing His sharee’ah.","Al-Ajwibah al-Mufeedah li Muhimmaat al-‘Aqeedah, p. 77-78"

It was narrated that the great Sahaabi ‘Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl used to kiss the Mus-haf and say, “This is the word of my Lord.” Whatever the case, there is nothing wrong with kissing it, but it is not prescribed to do so and there is nothing to indicate that it is prescribed in sharee’ah.

Is this true or not?",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is nothing special about

          disturb them when one is in ihraam for Hajj or ‘Umrah or not, so long 
          as one is within the haram (sanctuary) of Makkah or Madeenah. If one 
          goes outside the limits of the sanctuary, then it is permissible to 
          hunt them for those who are not in ihraam for Hajj or ‘Umrah, because

        “O 
          you who believe! Kill not the game while you are in a state of Ihraam 
          [for Hajj or ‘Umrah (pilgrimage)]…”

-- and because the Prophet  (peace

          me or after me, except for one hour of one day [i.e., on the day of 
          the Conquest of Makkah – Translator]. Its thorns shall not be cut, its 
          trees shall not be chopped down, and its animals shall not be disturbed…” 
          (Narrated by al-Bukhaari).  
And he  (peace and blessings of

          stones. Its trees should not be cut down and its animals should not 
          be hunted.” (Narrated by Muslim). 
 Whoever claims that the pigeons of Madeenah fly to 
          Makkah when the time of their death approaches and fly over the Ka’bah 
          is an ignorant person who is making a claim that has no basis of truth.

          of the meaning): 
“… and 
          no person [lit. no soul] knows in what land he will die…”

 Bidding farewell to the Ka’bah is only done by doing 
          Tawaaf al-Wadaa’ (Farewell 
          Tawaaf) when one has performed Hajj or ‘Umrah. The claim that pigeons 
          know when they will die and that they bid farewell to the Ka’bah by

          or who does false and evil actions, then it is not permissible to take 
          him as an imaam or to pray behind him, because whoever claims to have 
          knowledge of the unseen is a kaafir – we ask Allaah to keep us safe 
          and sound. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):   
“Say: “None in the heavens and 
          the earth knows the Ghayb (Unseen) except Allaah” [al-Naml 
          27:65]   
The same applies to one who practices sihr (witchcraft or magic) – 
          he comes under the same rulings as the kaafir, because Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning):   
“They followed 
          what the Shayaateen (devils) gave out (falsely of the magic) in the 
          lifetime of Sulaymaan (Solomon). Sulaymaan did not disbelieve, but the 
          Shayaateen (devils) disbelieved, teaching men magic and such things

          better to find someone else who is of sound character and is righteous,

          say that it is not permissible to pray behind (such a person).  
          
Sinners should not be taken as imaams, but if they are already in

          be that the people are being tested by means of them, or necessity may

          anyone other than Allaah, or who seeks the help of the dead, we should 
          not pray behind him, because this action makes him one of the kuffaar,

9348,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9348,He works for a company that deals with insurance,I work for a shipping company that ship package all over the world. I was told by my supervisor that i will be require to ask the customer if they want too add insurance wich s 35 cent on every hundred dollar to protect their package and i have to push button on the computer and it's done in seconds.My questin is will this make my job haram because of the insurance ? Is this RIBA ? Will I be CURSE by ALLAH for this ?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Working in shipping is halaal if the products being shipped are things that are permissible according to sharee’ah and are not haraam things such as alcohol, pork or anything that it is forbidden to eat, drink, wear, etc. 
Secondly: 
The commercial insurance which insurance companies deal in is haraam. One of the reasons for it being haraam is the fact that it involves riba and gambling, both of which are haraam according to the texts of the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and the consensus (ijmaa’) of the Muslims. 
See Question no. 8889. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
Insurance on one’s life and property is haraam according to sharee’ah and is not permitted, because it involves ambiguity and riba. Allah has forbidden all riba-based transactions and all transactions that involve ambiguity, out of mercy towards this ummah and to protect it from that which may harm it. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah has permitted trading and forbidden Riba” [al-Baqarah 2:275]
and it was narrated in a saheeh hadeeth that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade transactions involving ambiguity. And Allah is the Source of strength. 
Fatawa Islamiyyah, 3/5 
Thirdly: 
Allah describes riba as a very serious issue, and warns against it, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Fear Allah and give up what remains (due to you) from Ribaa (from now onward) if you are (really) believers.
 
And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger”
[al-Baqarah 2:278-279]
Muslim (1598) narrated that Jaabir said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba, the one who pays it, the one who writes it down and the two who witness it. He said, “They are all the same.” 
Al-Nawawi said:  
This clearly shows that it is haraam to write d own the contract between the two parties or to witness it. It also shows that it is haraam to help others to commit falsehood. 
Your pushing the button to proceed with the insurance is like writing it down, so it is included in the hadeeth quoted above. 
Fourthly: 
It is not permissible for a Muslim to work for a company that deals in riba and other haraam transactions. The prohibition is not restricted to the one who writes down the details of the riba or the one who witnesses it, rather it includes all the employees who work in the company, even the doorkeepers and security guards, because this helps the company to do the haraam transactions that they engage in. And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression”
[al-Maa’idah 5:2]
Fifthly: 
The Muslim should look for halaal work, for consuming haraam wealth is one of the things that prevent du’aa’ from being answered, and is one of the causes of entering Hell. Any body that has been nourished on haraam earnings, the Fire is more fitting for it. 
If a Muslim gives up something haraam in obedience to Allah, then Allah will replace it with something better than it, for whoever gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with something better.

9355,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9355,The myth that visiting the grave of ‘Ali equals seventy Hajj,"Does visiting the graves of ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him), al-Husayn, al-‘Abbaas and others equal seventy pilgrimages to the Sacred House of Allaah? Did the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, “Whoever visits the members of my household (ahl bayti) after I die will have seventy Hajj recorded for him”? Please advise us, may Allaah reward you with good?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Visiting graves is a Sunnah which provides a lesson and a reminder. If the graves are those of Muslims, one should make du’aa’ for them… The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to visit graves and make du’aa’ for the deceased, as did his companions, may Allaah be pleased with them. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Visit the graves, for they remind you of the Hereafter.” He used to teach his companions, when they visited graves, to say, “Al-salaamu ‘alayum ahl al-diyaar min al-mu’mineen wa’l-muslimeen, wa innaa in sha Allaah bikum laahiqoon. Nas’al Allaaha lana wa lakum al-‘aafiyah (Peace be upon you O inhabitants of the dwellings, believers and Muslims. If Allaah wills, we shall join you soon. We ask Allaah to keep us and you safe and sound.).”  
According to the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah: “Yarham Allaah al-mustaqdimeena minna wa’l-musta’khireen (may Allaah have mercy on those of us who went first and those who will join them afterward).” According to the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas “yaghfir Allaah lana wa lakum, antum salafuna wa nahnu fi’l-athr (May Allaah forgive us and you. You are our predecessors and we are following in your footsteps).” Making du’aa’ for them in these or similar words is all good. Visiting them brings a reminder and a lesson to the believer to prepare for what has befallen them, i.e., death, for what happened to them will happen to him too. So let him make preparations and strive to obey Allaah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and keep away from that which Allaah and His Messenger have forbidden. Let him repent from his previous shortcomings. This is how the believer is to benefit from visiting graves.  
With regard to what is mentioned (in the question) about visiting the graves of ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him), al-Hasan, al-Husayn and others being equivalent to seventy Hajj – this is a lie and is falsely attributed to the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and it has no basis. Visiting the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who is the best of all, is not equivalent to one Hajj; this visit has its status and virtues, but it is not equivalent to Hajj, so how about visits to anyone else’s grave? This is a lie, as is the phrase “Whoever visits the members of my household (ahl bayti) after I die will have seventy Hajj recorded for him.” All of this has no basis at all and all of it is false. All of it is lies made up by the liars. The believer has to beware of these fabricated things that have been falsely attributed to the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It is Sunnah to visit the graves whether they are graves of the members of his household (Ahl al-Bayt) or other Muslims; (it is Sunnah) to visit them, make du’aa’ for them, pray for mercy for them and then leave.  
If they are the graves of kaafirs, they may be visited for the purpose of learning a lesson and being reminded, without making du’aa’ for them. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) visited his mother’s grave, but his Lord forbade him to pray for forgiveness for her. He visited her grave for the purpose of the lesson and reminder, but he did not pray for forgiveness for her. This applies to all other graves – graves of kaafirs – if a believer visits them for the purpose of the lesson and reminder, there is nothing wrong with that, but he should not greet them with salaams or pray for forgiveness for them, because they do not deserve that.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 9, p. 283"
9356,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9356,Does faith increase and decrease according to Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah?,What is the definition of eemaan (faith) according to Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah? Does it increase and decrease?,,,"Praise be to Allah.According to Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah, eemaan (faith) is “belief in the heart, words on the tongue and actions of the body.” This includes three things:
 1.Belief in the heart
2.Words on the tongue
3.Actions of the body 
As this is the case, then it will increase and decrease. That is because the degree of belief in the heart differs from one person to another. Believing  in what someone tells you is not the same as believing something that you see with your own eyes. Believing in what one person tells you is not the same as believing what two people tell you, and so on. Hence Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) said:
“ ‘My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead.’ He (Allah) said: ‘Do you not believe?’ He [Ibraaheem (Abraham)] said: ‘Yes (I believe), but to be stronger in Faith’” [al-Baqarah 2:260]  
Eemaan may increase with regard to belief, contentment and tranquillity in the heart. A person may experience that in himself when he attends gatherings of dhikr where he hears a lesson. Remembering Paradise and Hell increases eemaan to the point where it as if you can see them with your own eyes. But when a person is negligent and leaves those gatherings, this certain faith is reduced in his heart.
Eemaan in the sense of words may increase similarly. Whoever remembers Allah a few times is not like one who remembers Him one hundred times. The latter is far better in eemaan.  
And the one who does an act of worship in a perfect manner will have more faith than one who does it in an imperfect manner.
 The same applies to righteous deeds. If a person does good deeds physically more than another, the one who does more will have more eemaan than the one who does less. This is stated in the Qur’aan and Sunnah – I mean the fact that eemaan may increase and decrease. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And We have fixed their number (19) only as a trial for the disbelievers, in order that the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) may arrive at a certainty [that this Qur’aan is the truth as it agrees with their Books regarding the number (19) which is written in the Tawraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] and that the believers may increase in Faith [al-Muddaththir 74:31]
 “And whenever there comes down a Soorah, some of them (hypocrites) say: “Which of you has had his Faith increased by it?” As for those who believe, it has increased their Faith, and they rejoice.
But as for those in whose hearts is a disease (of doubt, disbelief and hypocrisy), it will add suspicion and doubt to their suspicion, disbelief and doubt; and they die while they are disbelievers [al-Tawbah 9:124-125]
According to a saheeh hadeeth, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have never seen any women lacking in reason and faith who have a more negative impact on the mind of a serious man than you.” 
Thus eemaan increases and decreases.","Majmoo’ Fatawa wa Rasaa’il Fadeelat al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen , vol. 1, p. 49)"

By affirming the Unity of Allaah (Tawheed) and bearing witness to His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), one attains sincerity (ikhlaas) and obedience (in accordance with what is prescribed in sharee’ah), and these are the conditions of all acts of worship being accepted.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il Fadeelat al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, vol. 1, p. 84, question no. 29"
9359,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9359,Showing off (riya) in worship,"Is there any chance of getting blessings from an act ruined by riyaa if one's intentions change to please Allah after the thought of riyaa has already come? For example, I finish reciting Qu'an, and the thought of riyaa enters my mind. If I immediately fight this thought with thinking about Allah, can I still get blessings for my recitation, or is it completely ruined forever because of riyaa, given that the act is over and the riyaa thought came after it was already over?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
Showing off may affect worship in three ways: 
1 – When the basic motive for worship is to be seen by others, such as one who stands and prays so that people will see him, and so that they will praise him for his prayers. This invalidates the act of worship. 
2 – When it is a factor that develops during the act of worship, i.e., if the worshipper is initially sincere in his intention towards Allah, then the idea of showing off develops whilst he is doing it. In this case one of the following two scenarios must apply: 
(i) There is no connection between the first part of his act of worship and the last part, so the first part is valid in all cases, and the last part is invalid.
For example: a man has one hundred riyals that he wants to give in charity, so he gives fifty of them in a sincere act of charity. Then the idea of showing off develops with regard to the remaining fifty. So the first was a sound and accepted act of charity, but the last fifty was an invalid act of charity because the sincerity was mixed with a desire to show off.
(ii) The first part of the act of worship is connected to the last part, in which case one of the following two scenarios must apply:
(a) He wards off the idea of showing off and does not give in to it, rather he turns away from it and hates it. This does not have any effect on him, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has forgiven my ummah for what crosses their minds, so long as they do not act upon it or speak of it.”
(b) When he gives in to this idea of showing off and does not ward it off. In this case the entire act of worship becomes invalid, because the first part is connected to the last part. For example, he starts the prayer with a sincere intention towards Allah, then the idea of showing off develops in the second rak’ah, so the entire prayer becomes invalid because the first part is connected to the last part.
3 – The idea of showing off develop after the act of worship has ended. This does not affect it or invalidate it, because it has been completed soundly, so if showing off occurs after that it does not affect it. 
It is not showing off if a person feels happy that the people come to know about his worship, because this developed after he has finished the act of worship.  
It is not showing off if a person feels happy because he has done an act of worship, because that is a sign of his faith. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever feels happy because of his good deeds and sad because of his bad deeds, that is the believer.” 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about that and said: “That is the first glad tidings of the believer.”

    reward you with good for adhering to Islam, and we ask Allaah to make you steadfast in Islam and to send you people who will help you to do so.  
With regard to the question: 
Firstly, you have to bear their annoyance 
    with patience, because the path of adherence (to Islam) is not easy, but it is the path of the Prophets. The Muslim is bound to face difficulties 
    in the way of his adhering to Islam, as Muslim narrated in his Saheeh (2823) from Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger 
    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Paradise is surrounded with difficulties and Hell is surrounded with desires.” 
    The Prophets (peace be upon them) were faced with difficulties from their people and from the closest of people to them, but the reward for their 
    patience was that Allaah caused them ultimately to prevail. 
Secondly: 
The Muslim sister should strive to advise her 
    family with kindness, wisdom and beautiful preaching, and she should not despair or give up. She should show a good attitude towards them, say and 
    do good things to them, and extend a helping hand to them, even to those who cause her the most hardship. This will have an effect on them, in sha 
    Allah, and this is one of the most effective ways of calling people to Allaah.
Thirdly:
 She should try to find people to help and 
    support her, by trying to persuade those among her family members who like her, because they will be more likely to respond than others. 
Fourthly: 
You have to equip yourself with the most 
    effective “weapon”, which is praying for them to be guided and that Allaah will fill their hearts with the light of adherence to Islam. You should 
    say such du’aa’s a lot when prostrating and during the last part of the night, and at other times when du’aa’ is especially recommended, and you 
    should not try to hasten the response.  
Fifthly:
 You should note that it is not always good 
    to break off ties. In some cases, when those whom Allaah has guided break off ties with their families, this makes them go further in their sin 
    and farther removed from religious commitment. Breaking off ties may cause a person distress and make him unable to bear it. Hence we think that 
    the sister should be patient and mix with her family in ways that will not affect her religious commitment and level of faith. The more she 
    withdraws into herself –i.e., at home – the better, because if a woman leaves the family home, that may make people talk badly about her a lot, 
    and evil-minded people may try to approach because she has gone away from those who could take care of her and protect her. 
Your staying may be more beneficial to your 
    family, because there are many sins that the family may not dare to commit out of respect for their children whom Allaah has guided. If the 
    children leave, this will give the family more freedom to commit whatever sins they want. 
Hence the daa’iyah should be wise and should 
    weigh up the pros and cons of leaving. He should not give a small benefit precedence over warding off a greater evil; warding off evil is more 
    important than gaining benefits. 
Sixthly: 
There is no better du’aa’ for such situations 
    than the du’aa’ of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he prayed for his people to be forgiven and guided. 

    (a)
    It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood said: It is as if I can see the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) telling us the story of one of the Prophets whose people beat him and made him bleed, and he was wiping the blood from his face and saying, 
    “O Allaah, forgive my people for they do not know.”
 (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3290; Muslim, 
    1792). 
Al-Nawawi said:  
The Prophet referred to is one of the earlier 
    Prophets. Something similar happened to our Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on the day of Uhud. 
(Sharh Muslim, 12/150) 

    (b)
    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: Tufayl ibn ‘Amr al-Dawsi and his companions came to the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allaah, (the tribe of) Daws have rebelled, so pray to Allaah 
    against them.” The people said, “Daws are doomed.” But the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O Allaah, guide Daws 
    and bring them to me.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2779; Muslim, 
    2524) 

    (c)
    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: “I used to call my mother to Islam when she was still a mushrik. I called her one day and 
    she said something about the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that I did not like to hear. I came to the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) weeping, and said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, I have been calling my mother to 
    Islam and she refuses. I called her today and she said something about you that I did not like to hear. Pray to Allaah to guide the mother of Abu 
    Hurayrah.’ The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ‘O Allaah, guide the mother of Abu Hurayrah.’ I went 
    back, feeling optimistic because of the du’aa’ of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). When I came back, I 
    went to the door and found it locked. My mother heard my footsteps and said, ‘Stay where you are, O Abu Hurayrah.’ I could hear the sound of 
    water. She washed herself (did ghusl), put on her chemise and quickly covered her head with her head cover, then she opened the door and said, ‘O 
    Abu Hurayrah, I bear witness that there is no god except Allaah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.’ I went back to the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), weeping with joy, and said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah (S), good news! Allaah 
    has answered your prayer and guided the mother of Abu Hurayrah.’ He praised and thanked Allaah.” 
(Narrated by Muslim, 2491)

Questioning in the grave


Life in the grave


Will those who die by drowning or burning be punished in the grave?","Praise be to Allah.Muslims’ belief about the Unseen
Firstly: it should be noted that what is obligatory upon every believing man and woman is to believe what Allah tells them in His Book or on the lips of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about all matters that have to do with the Hereafter, the Reckoning, Paradise and Hell, or that have to do with death, the grave and torment or blessing in the grave, and all matters of the Unseen that are mentioned in the Noble Quran or in the authentic reports of the Sunnah. We have to believe and accept that, because we know that our Lord tells the truth in all that He says and tells us about. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and whose words can be truer than those of Allah? (Of course, none).” [al-Nisa4:122]
“And who is truer in statement than Allah?”[al-Nisa 4:87] 
We know that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the most truthful of people, and that he never spoke on the basis of his own whims and desires; it was Revelation which was revealed to him. Whatever was proven in the authentic hadiths, it is obligatory to believe in it even if we do not fully understand it. 
So what we have to do is to believe what has been narrated concerning the matters of the Hereafter and of Paradise and Hell , and the blessings of the people of Paradise and the torments of the people of Hell, and the fact that in the grave a person will be tormented or blessed, and that his soul will return to him. All of this is true and is stated in the texts, so we have to submit to that and believe everything that we learn from the Quran or that is narrated in the authentic Sunnah or on which the scholars of Islam reached consensus. 
If Allah blesses a believing man or woman with knowledge of the reasons for that, then it is even better, light upon light and knowledge upon knowledge. So let him praise Allah and give thanks to Him for the knowledge and insight that He has bestowed, thus increasing his knowledge and peace of mind. 
Questioning in the grave
With regard to the questioning in the grave and the state of the deceased, this questioning is real. The deceased person’s soul will be restored to him; authentic reports to that effect have been narrated from the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Life in the grave
The life of the deceased in the grave is different from his life in this world; it is a special kind of life in al-barzakh (the interval between his death and the Day of Resurrection) which is not like his life in this world, where he needs food and drink etc. It is a special kind of life wherein he can understand the questions and answers, so the two angels will ask him, Who is your Lord? What is your religion? Who is your Prophet? 
The believer will say, My Lord is Allah, Islam is my religion and Muhammad is my Prophet. This will be the answer of believing men and women. Then he will be asked, What do you know about this man (Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him))? He will say, He is the Messenger of Allah. He brought us guidance and we believed in him and followed him. It will be said: we knew that you were a believer. Then a gate to Paradise will be opened for him, and he will feel its rest and provision and blessings. It will be said, This is your place until Allah resurrects you to it. And he will be shown his place in Hell, and it will be said to him, This would have been your place if you had disbelieved in Allah, but now Allah has granted you refuge from it and you have ended up in Paradise. 
As for the non-Muslim, he will be asked about his Lord and his religion and his Prophet, and he will say, Oh, oh, I don’t know, I heard the people saying something so I said the same. Then he will be beaten with an iron rod and will utter a scream that will be heard by all things apart from al-thaqalayn, i.e. jinn and men; the animals will hear it. Then a gate to Hell will be opened for him, and his grave will constrict until his ribs intermingle, and his grave will be like one of the pits of Hell. A gate to Hell will be opened for him and he will feel its heat and torment . It will be said, This is your place until Allah resurrects you to it. Then a door to Paradise will be opened for him and he will be shown his place in Paradise, and it will be said to him, This would have been your place if Allah had guided you. 
From this, we know that the grave will be either one of the gardens of Paradise or one of the pits of Hell. The torment or blessing will happen to the body as well as the soul in the grave, and also in the Hereafter, in either Paradise or Hell.
Will those who die by drowning or burning be punished in the grave?
With regard to those who die by drowning or burning, or are eaten by wild animals, their souls will have their share of torment or blessing, and that will come to their bodies on land or in the sea, or in the bellies of the wild animals, as much as Allah wills. But most of the blessing or torment will come to their souls which remain, either in a state of blessing or a state of torment. 
The soul of the believer will go to Paradise; the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The soul of the believer is a bird which hangs from the trees of Paradise, eating their fruits; the soul of the disbeliever goes to Hell.”
Every Muslim man and woman has to accept what Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) have told us, and believe it as it was meant by Allah, even though some of the meaning may be hidden from us. And Allah has perfect wisdom, may He be glorified.

    knowledge and call people to Allaah. We ask Allaah to bless us all with beneficial knowledge and righteous deeds, and to make us guides who are 
    rightly guided. The one who calls people to Allaah must equip himself with knowledge. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘This is my way; I 
    invite unto Allaah (i.e. to the Oneness of Allaah — Islamic Monotheism) with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows me (also must invite others 
    to Allaah, i.e. to the Oneness of Allaah — Islamic Monotheism with sure knowledge). And Glorified and Exalted be Allaah (above all that they 
    associate as partners with Him). And I am not of the Mushrikoon (polytheists, pagans, idolaters and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allaah; those 
    who worship others along with Allaah or set up rivals or partners to Allaah)’”
[Yoosuf 12:108]
Allaah has given us many ways nowadays that 
    make it easy to seek knowledge without any hardship and without having to go of the house; that is by means of cassette tapes, the computer and 
    the internet. 
Women – and also men – must follow the right 
    way of acquiring knowledge, starting with what is easy before embarking on difficult matters. It is also essential to use a balanced approach and 
    not to take on more than you can handle so that you will not give up.  
We advise our sister to do the following: 
Be sincere towards Allaah in seeking 
    knowledge – and indeed in all your affairs; if you intend to dispel ignorance from yourself and from others, and to draw closer to Allaah first of 
    all, then this is worship. And you should not seek to show off to people with your knowledge or to argue with the foolish. 
You should memorize some of the Qur’aan. This 
    can only be achieved by following and sticking to a daily program of memorizing a certain amount. It may be a good idea to commit to learning a 
    small amount, and do not increase it even if you find that you have more time and energy on some occasions, for a small deed that is done 
    regularly is better than a large deed done intermittently. 
You should read summaries of all branches of 
    knowledge, and leave the detailed works until later. In almost every branch of knowledge there are books which give a gradual approach, starting 
    with brief discussions and ending with lengthy and detailed analysis. 
You should strive to memorize these texts if 
    you can, because memorizing evidence, whether from the Qur’aan or Sunnah, and memorizing the texts of knowledge will help you to follow the 
    correct path to knowledge. The scholars said, “Whoever memorizes the texts has excelled.” 
You should strive to study the commentaries 
    on these books. The best is to listen to recordings. We recommend the sister, and every Muslim, to listen to the lessons of Shaykh Muhammad ibn 
    Saalih ibn ‘Uthaymeen, because there is no branch of knowledge that he did not discuss on tapes that are easy to get hold of and they are now 
    available on the internet. 
She should look for sisters who can help her 
    to seek knowledge, with whom she can read and study. 
Just as she allocates time for reading 
    Qur’aan, she should also allocate time for all other branches of knowledge. She should read a little about Tawheed and about hadeeth and fiqh and 
    all other branches of knowledge. 
She should seek the help of Allaah in her 
    pursuit of knowledge and da’wah. Putting one's trust in Allaah, pursuing the appropriate means, and praying to Him to make things easy are all 
    among the greatest and most beneficial means of reaching one's goal. Shyness should not prevent you from seeking knowledge and asking questions. 
One of the salaf said, “No shy or arrogant 
    person will ever seek knowledge.” So shyness should not stop you from asking questions about Islam. And arrogance is harmful in this world and in 
    the Hereafter; one of its harmful effects in this world is that it keeps a person from asking and learning. 
For a list of books which the seeker of 
    knowledge can begin with, please see Question no. 14082; this contains a list of books 
    which the seeker of knowledge should study. Please see also question no. 20191.

      workers about eight years ago, and sold the visas to another person here,
      on the basis that he would bring in the workers and they would do whatever
      work he wanted, i.e., they would not be working with me in my company.
      This was a condition between me and them, and we agreed that they would
      pay a portion of their salary to me at the end of each month, but this was
      not binding. Some of the workers have gone back to their own country, and
      I have no address for them, and some of them are still here, but I do not
      take any money from them. What is the ruling on the money which I have
      taken for selling the visas and the money I have taken from the workers?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Selling
      visas is not permissible, because it involves telling lies, breaking the
      law and deceiving the authorities, and it is consumption of wealth by
      means of falsehood. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And
      eat up not one another’s property unjustly (in any illegal way, e.g.
      stealing, robbing, deceiving), nor give bribery to the rulers…”
      [al-Baqarah 2:188].
On
      this basis, the money you earned from selling the visas and the money you
      took from the workers is haraam income, so you have to get rid of it and
      clear yourself of it. Whatever you have obtained by selling visas, spend
      it in charitable ways such as giving to the poor and building facilities
      that will benefit the Muslims.
Concerning
      the money which you have taken from the workers themselves each month, you
      have to give it back to them if they are still in the country, or try to
      send it to them in their own country. If you could not find out where they
      are or send it to them, then give it in charity on their behalf, because
      this money was deducted from them unlawfully and they were not compensated
      for it. You have to keep on repenting for this action, and never repeat it

9386,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9386,Can Agents Take Extra Money If They Sell for a Higher Price?,"I am working for a company that sells products. The Sales Manager told me that I can sell a product with a cost of SR 1,000. Although I am not working in the Sales Department, I was able to locate customers who can pay more than that price, i.e SR1,500.
Is it Ok to sell it with 1,500 and give the company 1000 and leave the rest for me?","If the company stipulated the price to an agent and agreed with him that if he sells it for more the extra money would be his, it is permissible for the agent to sell it for more and he can take the extra money.",,"Praise be to Allah.If the company has stipulated the price and said that you should not sell it for more than that, then it is not permissible for you to sell it for more than the stipulated price. However, if the company has stipulated the price but has not said that you should not sell it for more than that, then it is permissible for you to sell it for more. In either case, the extra money belongs to the company and it is not permissible for you to take it. 
That is because the agent should work for the interests of his employer, not for his own interests. 
The evidence for that is the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (3643) from `Urwah (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave him a Dinar to buy a sheep for him. He bought two sheep and sold one for a dinar, and brought him a sheep and a Dinar. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed that he would be blessed in his transactions and that even if he bought dust he would profit from it.
`Urwah (may Allah be pleased with him) was acting as the agent of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in this purchase, and he was able to make a profit in his buying and selling. This profit belonged to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), because if it had belonged to `Urwah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would not have taken it. 
Ibn `Abd Al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“There is no dispute among the scholars that it is permissible to act as an agent . But the scholars differed concerning the meaning of this Hadith and whether, if the agent buys more than he was told to, that transaction is binding upon his employer. For example, if a man says to another, Buy me a pound of meat with this Dirham, and describes what kind of meat it should be, and he buys four pounds of that kind of meat with that Dirham. The opinion of Malik and his companions is that he has to accept this transaction, if the meat is of the kind stipulated but is of a larger amount because he has done well. This Hadith supports this view, and it is a good Hadith [sound]. It proves that the two sheep belonged to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), otherwise he could not have accepted the Dinar or approved of this transaction.” (At-Tamheed, 2/108)
The Standing Committee was asked about this matter and they said: 
“It is permissible to sell a product for more than its price if that is possible, but the extra money belongs to the owner of the product. But if the owner stipulated that it was not to be sold for a higher price, then it should be sold for the price stipulated by the owner.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 13/96) 
But if the company stipulated the price to you, and agreed with you that if you sold it for more then the extra money would be yours, it is permissible for you to sell it for more and the extra money is yours.  
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni (7/361): 
“If he said, Sell this garment for ten and anything extra is yours, then that is valid and he is entitled to the extra money… Ibn `Abbas did not see anything wrong with that.” 
And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
9389,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9389,"Repeating the name of Allaah on its own, or the pronoun “Huwa” (He), is a Sufi bid’ah","Is there any harm in repeating the names of Allah SWT?
As zikr, or anything else?
I understand saying ""Astagh firullah"" or ""Subhan Allah"" or ""Alhamdo Lillah"" are ok...",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is no doubt that it is bid’ah to mention the name of Allaah on its own or –even worse – to repeat the pronoun “Huwa” (“He”). Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:
The Name of Allaah on its own, either as a noun (“Allaah”) or a pronoun (“Huwa”) is not a complete phrase or meaningful sentence. It has no implications to do with eemaan (faith) or kufr (disbelief), commands or prohibitions. This was not mentioned by anyone from the Salaf (early generations) of this ummah, and it was not prescribed by the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It does not bring any knowledge to the heart or bestow any kind of benefit upon it. All it does is give an unclear idea which is not defined by any negation or affirmation. Unless there is previous knowledge in a person's mind or he is in a state of mind where he could benefit from this, he gains no benefit at all. Islam prescribes adhkaar which in and of themselves bring benefit to the heart, without any such need for anything else.
Some of those who persisted in this kind of “dhikr” ended up in various kinds of heresies and ideas of “wahdat al-wujood” (unity of all that exists, pantheism), as has been explained in detail elsewhere.
It was mentioned that one of the shaykhs said: “I am afraid of dying between negation and affirmation”, but this is not an example to be followed, because it is obviously erroneous. If a person were to die in this state, he would die according to his intention, because actions are judged by intention. It was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded us to tell the dying person to say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah,and he said, “Anyone whose last words are Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah will enter Paradise.” If this word (Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah) was something which required caution, why should we tell the dying person to say something which, if he dies in the middle of saying it, will lead to an improper death? Rather, if this were the case, he would be told to say “Allaah, Allaah” or “Huwa, Huwa.” 
Mentioning the pronoun on its own is further removed from the Sunnah and is a worse kind of bid’ah, which is closer to the misguidance of the Shaytaan. If a person says “Yaa Huwa, yaa Huwaa (O He, O He)” or “Huwa, Huwa (He, He)” and so on, the pronoun does not refer to anything except whatever his heart imagines, and hearts may be guided or misguided.
Some shaykhs use as evidence to support saying “Allaah” (the name on its own) the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say: ‘Allaah.’ Then leave them…” [al-An’aam 6:91]. They think that Allaah commanded His Prophet to say His Name on its own, but this is a mistake according to the consensus of the scholars, because the meaning of the phrase “Say ‘Allaah’” is that it is Allaah Who sent down the Book which was brought by Moosa. This is in response to the question:
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘Who then sent down the Book which Moosa (Moses) brought, a light and a guidance to mankind which you (the Jews) have made into (separate) paper sheets, disclosing (some of it) and concealing (much). And you (believers in Allaah and His Messenger Muhammad) were taught (through the Qur’aan) that which neither you nor your fathers knew.’ Say: ‘Allaah (sent it down).’” [al-An’aam 6:91 – interpretation of the meaning], i.e., Allaah is the One Who revealed the Book which was brought by Moosa. This is a refutation of the view of thosewho said, “Nothing did Allaah send down to any human being (by Revelation)”[al-An’aam 6:91 – interpretation of the meaning]. Allaah says: Who then sent down the Book which Moosa brought? Then He says: Say Allaah sent it down, then leave these liars to play in their vain discussions.
What we have said above is further explained by the comments of Seebawayh and other grammarians, who noted that when the Arabs say “Qaala” (or other forms of the verb meaning “to say”), they do not quote verbatim, rather they state what was said, giving a complete meaning. So what follows is a sentence with a complete meaning, or a nominal sentence or a verbal sentence. Hence after saying “qaala” they give a kasrah to the particle “anna” (making it “inna”); “qaala” cannot be followed by a noun standing alone. Allaah did not command anyone to mention His Name on its own, and it is not prescribed for the Muslims to say His Name on its own. Saying His Name on its own does not enhance faith or explain anything about the religion, according to the consensus of the scholars of Islam; it is not enjoined in any act of worship or in any case where Allaah addresses them.
(Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 10/226-229)
 And he (may Allaah have mercy on him) also said:
 Repeating the Name of Allaah on its own, such as saying “Allaah, Allaah,” or the pronoun, such as “Huwa, Huwa” is not prescribed in either the Qur’aan or the Sunnah. It is not reported that any of the salaf of this ummah or any of the righteous scholars who are taken as examples did this. It is only spoken by misguided people of the later generations.
 Perhaps they are following a shaykh who had no control over himself in this regard, such as al-Shubli who, it was narrated, used to say ‘Allaah, Allaah.’ It was said to him, ‘Why do you not say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah?’ He said, “I am afraid of dying between the negation [saying La ilaaha (there is no god)] and the affirmation [ill-Allaah (except Allaah)]”!
This is one of the mistakes made by al-Shubli, who may be forgiven for it because of the sincerity of his faith and the strength of his emotions which overwhelmed him. Sometimes he would go crazy and would be taken to the asylum, and he would shave off his beard. There are other instances of this type in his case, which are not to be taken as examples, even if he may be excused or rewarded for them. If a person intends to say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah, and he dies before completing it, that will not harm him at all, because actions are judged by intentions, and what he intended to do is what will be written down for him.
Some of them go to extremes in this matter, and say that saying the name of Allaah is for the ‘elite’ whilst saying La ilaaha ill-Allaah is for the ‘masses.’ Some of them say that saying Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah is for the mu’mineen (believers), saying ‘Allaah’ is for the ‘aarifeen’ and saying ‘Huwa’ is for the muhaqqiqeen. One of them may restrict himself to saying, when alone or in a gathering, ‘Allaah, Allaah, Allaah’ or ‘Huwa’ or ‘Yaa Huwa’ or even ‘La Huwa illa Huwa (there is no He except He)’! Some of those who have written about spiritual matters have expressed approval of this, quoting some known figures who, however, were in a state of overwhelming emotion at the time, or quoting opinions, or quoting false reports – for example some of them reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib to say ‘Allaah, Allaah, Allaah.’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said it three times, then he told ‘Ali to say it three times so he said it three times. This hadeeth is fabricated (mawdoo’), according to the consensus of the scholars of hadeeth.  
It is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught people various adhkaar to say, and the best of dhikr is Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah. This is what he urged his paternal uncle Abu Taalib to say when he was dying. He said, “O uncle, say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah and I will defend you thereby before Allaah.” And he said: “I know of a word which no one says when he is dying but his soul finds rest in it.” And he said, “Anyone whose last words are Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah will enter Paradise.” And he said, “Whoever dies knowing that there is no god except Allaah will enter Paradise.” And he said: “I have been commanded to fight people until they bear witness that there is no god except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. If they do that, their blood and wealth will be safe from me, except for what is due from them [e.g., zakaah etc.], and their reckoning is with Allaah.” And there are many similar ahaadeeth.

9393,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9393,Repentance of an AIDS patient,A person is suffering from AIDS and the doctors have said that he only has a short time to live. What is the ruling on his repentance during this time?,,,"Praise be to Allah.He must hasten to repent, even if it is at the time of death, because the door of repentance is always open so long as he is of sound mind. He must hasten to repent and beware of sin, even if they have told him that the time he has left to live is short, because life spans are in the hand of Allah. The doctors may be mistaken in their thinking, and he may live for a long time. Whatever the case, he must hasten to repent and be sincere in doing so, so that Allah will accept his repentance. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
 “And all of you beg Allah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful” [al-Noor 24:31]
“And verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them (till his death)” [Ta-Ha 20:82]  
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“Allah will accept a person's repentance so long as the death rattle has not reached his throat” i.e., up until the time when the dying person loses consciousness. And Allah is the One Whose help we seek.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 9, p. 437"
