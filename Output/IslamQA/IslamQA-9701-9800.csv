9708,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9708,Ruling on a woman travelling without a mahram,What is the ruling on a woman travelling without a mahram because her work requires that of her?,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is haraam because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No woman should travel without a mahram.” This was narrated by Ahmad from the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) in his Musnad. Even if her work requires that of her, we say that if she cannot find a mahram then she should not travel.","I’laam al-Musaafireen bi Ba’d Aadaab wa Ahkaam al-Safar wa ma yakhuss al-Mallaaheen al-Jawwiyyeen by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, p. 13"
9726,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9726,Praying on board an airplane when one is in a state of janaabah (impurity),"It may so happen during a long journey that some travellers fall asleep in their seats and may experience wet dreams, or a traveller may board the plane having forgotten that he is in a state of janaabah, or a woman may become pure from her period or post-natal bleeding when the time for Fajr prayer begins. The plane will not reach the other country until after that time is over, and the safety regulations on board the plane absolutely forbid taking a bath in the washroom because the facilities are not suited for that. What should one do?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If it is possible to do tayammum 
          using the furnishings of the airplane, then you should do so. If that 
          is not possible because they are free from dust, then you should pray 
          even if you are not taahir, then as soon as you are able to purify yourself 
          after that, then do so.","I’laam al-Musaafireen bi Ba’d Aadaab wa Ahkaam al-Safar wa ma yakhuss al-Mallaaheen al-Jawwiyyeen by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, p. 13"
9740,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9740,Prohibition of Lying,"My mother is still alive and is over one hundred years old. She is in a difficult situation because she cannot understand things, and she asks whether it is evening when it is morning, and she repeats words more than five times. She cannot move from where she is, and if she has been sleeping she is not able to sit up, etc. Her children answer all her questions, but their answers may be lies, such as when she asks them in the evening whether it is the morning, and they tell her yes, even though it is the evening, and so on. My question is: if they tell her lies, are they sinning or not? The second question is: is there any kafarah (expiation) which they should pay to make up for her fasts and prayers, or not? Please advise us, may Allah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    You 
    should not tell her lies; you should tell her the truth, because telling her 
    lies does not serve any purpose or benefit her in any way, or make her 
    happy.

     With 
    regard to prayer and fasting, there is no kafarah to be paid, and there is 
    no sin on her, because she has become like a child. So long as she cannot 
    tell what is what, and her feelings and mind have changed, she is not 
    obliged to pray or fast, because she is not held accountable for that. She 
    is now like a little child who is free of responsibility and there is no sin 
    involved, in sha Allah.

9755,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9755,Do You Have to Wash Your Hair for Ghusl after Period?,"Sometimes I do ghusl for janabah (impurity following sexual activity) or menstruation, and I do not wash my hair because it is braided. What is the ruling on that?","It is not permissible not to wash your hair during ghusl after sexual intercourse or periods. Therefore, you have to repeat the prayer. If your hair is braided, then it is sufficient to pour water over it thrice.",,"Praise be to Allah.Not washing your hair during ghusl after sexual intercourse or periods is a serious mistake and it is not permissible to do that. Therefore the prayer is not valid. You have to wash all of your body, including the hair , as stated in the hadith of Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with he) who said: “I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, I am a woman who braids her hair – should I undo it to do ghusl for janabah?’ He said, ‘No, it is sufficient for you to pour water over your head three times.’” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 330)
If your hair is braided then you can wash it and make sure that the water reaches the roots as well as washing the rest of it. This is essential. Your prayers are not valid because you did not do ghusl from janabah properly. 
One of the conditions of ghusl from janabah is that water should reach every part of the body, including the hair. The same applies to ghusl following menstruation or post-natal bleeding.
You have to repeat the prayers which you prayed when you had not washed your hair when doing ghusl following janabah or menstruation.

He has passed away, but recently I have been having disturbing dreams, where I see him chasing me and my young daughter, but I run away from him and he cannot catch me. I hope you can suggest something to put my mind at rest.",,,"Praise be to Allah.These dreams and other unpleasant dreams come from the 
          Shaytaan. What is prescribed for the Muslim if he sees a dream that 
          he does not like is to spit drily to his left three times, and to seek 
          refuge with Allaah from the Shaytaan and from the evil of what he has 
          seen (three times), then to turn over onto his other side. Then the 
          dream will not harm him. He should not tell anyone about it, because 
          the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) said, according to a saheeh hadeeth, “Good dreams 
          come from Allaah and bad dreams come from the Shaytaan. If anyone of 
          you sees something that he dislikes in a dream, let him spit drily to 
          his left three times, and seek refuge with Allaah from the Shaytaan 
          and from the evil of what he has seen three times, then let him turn 
          over onto his other side. Then it will not harm him. He should not tell 
          anyone of what he has seen. But if he sees (a dream) that he likes,

9783,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9783,Ruling on woman being imaam for men,"In Islam, can a woman be an imaam in a mosque? What are the conditions for a woman to be an imaam?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It
      is not permissible for a woman to lead men in prayer. The Prophet 
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Keep women behind [in
      the back rows] as Allaah has commanded.” (Narrated by ‘Abd al-Razzaaq
      in his Musannaf, 5115. The
      isnaad stops at Ibn Mas’ood with a longer report than this; the isnaad
      is saheeh but it is not proven that this was said by the Prophet 
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)).
      
      
      Moreover,
      the position of imaam in the mosque is a kind of wilaayah [public office],
      and wilaayah is only for men. “No nation prospers that appoints a woman
      over its affairs [wilaayah]” (narrated by al-Bukhaari, 13/45, 46), as
      the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said.
      
      There
      is an exception made by the Hanbalis, but this is a weak opinion. This
      view says that a woman may lead the men in taraaweeh if she reads well and
      the men present are illiterate, but she should be behind them and they
      should be in front of her. But there is no evidence (daleel) to support
      this view. The point is that it is not permissible for a woman to lead men
      in prayer. Yes, women may lead other women in prayer, it is OK if she
      leads other women. This is fine, as stated in the report of Umm Waraqah
      leading some of her mahrams, but as for her leading non-mahram men or as a
      public office [wilaayah], such as being an imaam in a mosque, this is not
      permitted.","Fataawa Samaahat al-Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Humayd, p. 130"
9788,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9788,Does saying something that is bid’ah make one an innovator ?,"If a scholar says something that is bid’ah or he agrees with those who follow bid’ah concerning a particular innovation, is he one of them?",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          This question was put to Shaykh Muhammad 
          ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him), who said:
 
          The question may be examined from two 
          angles:
 
          If a scholar says something which is 
          bid’ah or follows the path of bid’ah with regard to a particular issue, 
          is he counted as being one of them?
 
          The answer is no, he is not counted as 
          being one of them and is not to be described as such. If he agrees with 
          them on one particular issue then he has agreed with them on that issue, 
          but it is not correct to say that he is one of them in absolute terms.
 
          For example, there may be someone who 
          follows the madhhab of Ahmad (i.e., Hanbali) but with regard to a particular 
          issue he follows the view of Imaam Maalik – is he to be counted as a 
          Maaliki? No.
 
          Similarly, if a faqeeh follows the madhhab 
          of Abu Haneefah (i.e., Hanafi) but with regard to a particular issue 
          he follows the madhhab of al-Shaafa’i, do we say that he is a Shaafa’i? 
          No.
 
          So if we see a scholar who is known to 
          be sincere following something that is the view of the people of bid’ah, 
          it is not correct for us to say that he is one of them or is following 
          their way. Rather we should say that because we know that they are following 
          the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and that they are sincere in advising people, 
          if they err with regard to this issue, that error stems from ijtihaad, 
          and the mujtahid in this ummah will have two rewards if he reaches the 
          right conclusion, and if he makes a mistake then he will have one reward.
 
          Whoever rejects the whole truth (to which 
          that person is calling people) because of one mistaken word is misguided, 
          especially if the thing that he thinks is a mistake is not actually 
          a mistake. Some people, if anyone disagrees with them, say that he is 
          mistaken. They may describe him as being mistaken or misguided, or even 
          as being a kaafir – Allaah forbid. This is an extremely bad way of judging 
          people. The one who regards people as being kaafirs for any reason or 
          for any sin, is following a way that is even harsher than the way of 
          the Khawaarij, because the Khawaarij used to regard the one who committed 
          a major sin as being a kaafir, not just the one who committed any sin. 
          So if there is anyone who regards the Muslims as kaafirs for any sin, 
          then he is misguided and is going against the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and 
          is more extreme than the Khawaarij whom ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib fought against. 
          The Muslims differed as to whether they were to be regarded as kaafirs. 
          Some described them as kaafirs (disbelievers) and some described them 
          as evildoers and extreme wrongdoers. Does not Allaah say (interpretation 
          of the meaning):
 “If 
          you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall expiate 
          from you your (small) sins, and admit you to a Noble Entrance (i.e. 
          Paradise)”
          [al-Nisaa’ 4:31]
 
          By avoiding major sins, a person may 
          be forgiven for minor sins, so long as he does not persist in those 
          minor sins. But if he persists in them, then the scholars said that 
          persisting in a minor sin makes that a major sin. No doubt the view 
          of those who label people as kaafirs because of their sins is misguided, 
          and the one who says that the Muslims should be regarded as kaafirs 
          because of their sins should note that the Messenger SAWS (peace and 
          blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever calls his brother a 
          kaafir – when that is not the case – it will come back on him.” This 
          is what the Messenger said, so even if that person is not regarded as 
          a kaafir in this world, he may become a kaafir in the sight of Allaah.","Al-Liqaa’ al-Shahri, 15 by Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him)"

9790,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9790,Is It Haram to Urinate Standing Up?,"What is the Shar’i ruling regarding standing while urinating? There is a hot debate here regarding this. While some claim that it is permissible, others claim it is haram. Their argument is that there is a hadith in which ‘Aishah says that “whoever tells you that the Prophet urinated while standing, do not believe him.” Please clarify the issue.","It is not haram for a man to urinate standing up, but it is Sunnah for him to urinate sitting down. ‘Aishah said: “Whoever tells you that the Prophet used to urinate standing up, do not believe him. He only ever used to urinate sitting down.” This is more concealing, and it reduces the risk of any drops of urine splashing up onto him.",,"Praise be to Allah.It is not haram for a man to urinate standing up , but it is Sunnah for him to urinate sitting down, because `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “Whoever tells you that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to urinate standing up , do not believe him. He only ever used to urinate sitting down.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, al-Taharah, 12; he said, this is the most sahih report on this topic. It was also classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Sunan al-Tirmidhi, no. 11). And because this is more concealing, and it reduces the risk of any drops of urine splashing up onto him . 
`Umar, Ibn `Umar and Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with them) narrated that it is allowed to urinate standing up on the condition that there is no risk of drops of urine splashing onto one’s body or clothes, and that one does not expose one's `awrah. 
Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated from Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to a garden belonging to some people, and urinated standing up . There is no contradiction between this and the hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), because it is possible that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did that because he was in a place where he was unable to sit down, or he did that to show the people that it is not haram. This does not contradict the basic principle mentioned by `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) urinated sitting down, because it is Sunnah, it is not something obligatory which it is forbidden to go against.
