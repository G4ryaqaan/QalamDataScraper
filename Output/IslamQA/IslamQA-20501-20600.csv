20501,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20501,Why is it haraam for the pilgrim to wear sewn garments?,"Why has Allah forbidden the pilgrims to wear sewn garments, and what is the reason behind that?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: Allah has enjoined Hajj once in a lifetime for those who are accountable and who are able to do it and have the means, and He has made it one of the pillars of Islam, as is well-known in Islam. So the Muslim has to do that which Allah has enjoined upon him, to please Allah and obey His command, hoping for His reward and fearing His punishment, whilst trusting that Allah is Wise in His laws and in all that He does, and that He is Merciful towards His slaves, so that He would not prescribe for them anything but that which is in their best interests and which will be of great benefit to them in this world and in the Hereafter. It is for our Lord, the Sovereign, the All-Wise, to issue laws, and it is for His slaves to obey and submit. 
Secondly: there are many reasons why it is prescribed for us to avoid sewn garments during Hajj and ‘Umrah. For example: to remind us of how people will be on the Day of Resurrection, for they will be resurrected barefoot and naked, then they will be clothed. Reminding ourselves of how things will be on the Day of Resurrection teaches us an important lesson. It also makes us humble and makes us feel that we are obliged to submit and cleanse ourselves of arrogance. And it reminds us of the principles of rapprochement, equality and asceticism, and of keeping away from the luxurious life which is condemned, and it makes us feel empathy for the poor and needy… and there are other aims behind doing Hajj in the manner prescribed by Allah and explained by His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
And Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and His family and companions.

(* Note: What is meant by sewn garments is not those which are stitched, rather it means those which are fitted to parts of the body, such as jackets which are fitted to the arms and chest, or pants which are fitted to the legs, or leather slippers (khuffayn) which are fitted to the feet, or gloves which are fitted to the hands. On that basis it is permitted to wear a watch which has stitching on the strap, or shoes on which there is stitching, or a belt in which there is stitching, and so on).",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
20505,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20505,Is al-Kihdr living on the face of the earth?,Is al-Khidr still living on the face of the earth until the present day? And will he remain alive until the Day of Resurrection?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Al-Shanqeeti said:
The stories of al-Khidr told by the righteous are innumerable. They claim that he and Ilyaas perform Hajj each year and they narrated du’aa’s from them, and these stories are well known and widespread, but the basis of what they say is very weak, because most of them are stories narrated from some of those whom they think are righteous, or dreams and ahaadeeth that are attributed to Anas or others, but all of them are da’eef (weak) and cannot be used to prove anything.
What seems to me to be more likely, based on the evidence concerning this matter, is that al-Khidr is not alive, rather he died. This is for a number of reasons:
1 – The apparent meaning of the aayah (interpretation of the meaning)
“And We granted not to any human being immortality before you (O Muhammad); then if you die, would they live forever?”
[al-Anbiya’ 21:34]
2 – The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O Allaah, if you allow this group of Muslims to be destroyed, You will not be worshipped on earth.” (Narrated by Muslim)
3 – The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that one hundred years after the night on which he was speaking, none of the people who were on the face of the earth then would still be alive. If al-Khidr had been alive at that point he would not have remained after the hundred years mentioned. Muslim ibn al-Hajjaaj said that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar said: “The Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) led us in praying ‘Isha’ one night towards the end of his life, then he stood up and said: ‘Do you see this night of yours? One hundred years from now not one of those who are on the face of the earth now will remain.” Ibn ‘Umar said: “The people did not understand these words of the Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and they said that this meant that the Day of Resurrection would come after one hundred years. The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ‘not one of those who are on the face of the earth now will remain’ meaning that that generation would pass away.”
4 – If al-Khidr had lived until the time of the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), he would have followed him, supported him and fought alongside him, because he was sent to the two races of jinn and mankind.","Adwaa’ al-Bayaan, 4/178-183"

“It is OK for a person to taste the food during the day whilst fasting, if necessary, and his fast is still valid so long as he does not deliberately swallow anything of it.”.","See Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, vol. 10, p. 332"
20597,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20597,He is practicing ‘azl with his wife so that she will not get pregnant because she is still studying,"Is it permissible to practise ‘azl (withdrawal or coitus interruptus) or a similar method (of contraception) if that will go on for two years or more, so that the wife can finish her studies before she gets pregnant? Or does this go against one of the most important reasons for marriage in Islam?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
One of the purposes of marriage in Islam is to have children and increase the numbers of the ummah. 
Abu Dawood (2050) narrated that Ma’qil ibn Yasaar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:  “Marry the one who is loving and fertile, for I will be proud of your great numbers before the nations [i.e., on the Day of Resurrection].” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 1805. 
Secondly: 
Practising ‘azl – which means ejaculating outside the vagina – is permissible, but that is subject to the condition that it be with the wife’s permission, because one of her rights is full enjoyment, and another of her rights is to have children, both of which are lost as a result of ‘azl. 
It was narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah said: We used to practise ‘azl at the time of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when the Qur’aan was being revealed. 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4911; Muslim, 1440. Muslim added: Sufyaan said: If there had been anything wrong with it, the Qur’aan would have forbidden it.   
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
With regard to ‘azl, some of the scholars regarded it as haraam, but the view of the four imams is that it is permissible with the wife’s permission. And Allaah knows best. 
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 32/110 
See also Question no. 11885. 
Thirdly: 
It is permissible for the spouses to agree on family planning so long as that is temporary and not a permanent thing – subject to the condition that the means used does not cause any harm to the woman. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
With regard to using temporary means of preventing pregnancy, such as when a woman gets pregnant easily and pregnancy is exhausting for her, and she wants to space her pregnancies so they will be two years apart and so on, this is permissible so long as her husband gives his permission and so long as that will not cause her any harm.
