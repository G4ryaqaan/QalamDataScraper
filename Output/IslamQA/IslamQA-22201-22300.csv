What questions will be asked on the Day of Judgement?","Praise be to Allah.Questions on the grave
It is proven in the Quran and Sunnah that when a person dies, he will be called to account for every major and minor action he did in this world, whether it was good or bad. He will be rewarded for his good deeds and punished for his bad deeds. 
The first stage of that reckoning is in the grave . In the grave, the first thing a person will be asked will be: Who was your Lord? What is your religion? Who is this man who was sent amongst you? – as was narrated in the Hadith of Al-Bara’ ibn `Azib (may Allah be pleased with him), which was narrated by Abu Dawud in his Sunan (4753) and classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 2979. 
What questions will be asked on the Day of Judgement?
Then on the Day of Resurrection he will be brought to account for every major and minor action , even though he has already been brought to account for that in the grave . The first thing for which he will be brought to account for then will be his prayer. 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The first thing among their deeds for which the people will be brought to account on the Day of Resurrection will be prayer. Our Lord will say to His angels, although He knows best, `Look at My slave’s prayer, is it complete or lacking?’ If it is complete, it will be recorded as complete, but if it is lacking, He will say, `Look and see whether my slave did any optional prayers.’ If he had done voluntary prayers, He will say, `Complete the obligatory prayers of My slave from his voluntary prayers.’ Then the rest of his deeds will be examined in a similar manner.” ((Narrated by Abu Dawud, 864; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 770)
On the Day of Resurrection, people will be asked about other matters, including the following: 

It was narrated from Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The son of Adam will not be dismissed from before his Lord on the Day of Resurrection until he has been questioned about five things: his life and how he spent it, his youth and how he used it, his wealth and how he earned it and how he disposed of it, and how he acted upon what he acquired of knowledge.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2422; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi, 1969) 
And the nations will be asked on the Day of Resurrection: 

“What answer gave you to the Messengers?” [Al-Qasas 28:65 – interpretation of the meaning]
These are some of the things about which people will be asked on the Day of Resurrection. So the wise person who is keen to save himself should prepare answers to these questions. We ask Allah to guide us to the straight path.

Zzzzdoes he have to make up his fasts and prayers?,,,"Praise be to Allah.If it really happened as you say, that this man had lost consciousness during that period – including the month of Ramadaan – when he was not aware of anything as a result of the accident, then he does not have to make up the fasts and prayers that he missed during the days when he was unconscious. This is according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, and is because he was not accountable or required to do those acts of worship during that period.

Please quote the evidence.,"It is better to offer sunnah prayers at home unless it is Sunnah to pray them in congregation in the mosque, such as th Eclipse prayer and nafl prayers before Jumu`ah.","Is it better to pray Sunnah at home?


Evidence for offering Sunnah prayer at home


Evidence for offering Eclipse prayer in the mosque


Evidence for offering Sunnah prayer before Jumu`ah in the mosque","Praise be to Allah.Is it better to pray Sunnah at home?
It is better to offer nafl prayers at home, unless it is Sunnah to pray them in congregation in the mosque, such as the prayers to be offered at the time of an eclipse , or it is narrated that it is encouraged to offer them in the mosque, such as nafl prayers before Jumu’ah . 
Evidence for offering Sunnah prayer at home
That was proven from the words and actions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The evidence for that includes the following: 

Ibn ‘Umar narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Perform some of your prayers in your houses and do not make them graves.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 422; Muslim, 777) 

Al-Nawawi said: 
“The words “Perform some of your prayers in your houses and do not make them graves” mean, pray in them (your houses), and do not make them like graveyards which are devoid of prayer. What is referred to here is nafl (supererogatory) prayers , i.e., offer nafl prayers in your houses.” (Sharh Muslim, 6/67) 

Zayd ibn Thabit narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made a cubicle – I think he said, made from a reed mat – in Ramadan, in which he prayed at night. Some of his Companions prayed behind him, and when he realized they were there he sat down. Then he went out to them and said, “I know how keen you are to pray behind me. O people, pray in your houses, for the best of prayer is a man’s prayer in his house, apart from the prescribed prayers.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 698; Muslim, 781) 

Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar said: 
“The apparent meaning is that this includes all nafl prayers , because what is meant by the prescribed prayers is the obligatory prayers. But it may be interpreted as referring to all those for which it is not prescribed to offer them in congregation and those which are not to be offered specifically in the mosque, such as the two rak`ahs for “greeting the mosque.” This is the view of some of our imams.” (Fath al-Bari, 2/215) 

‘Abd-Allah ibn Shaqiq said: I asked `Aishah about the voluntary prayers of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). She said: He used to pray four rak`ahs before Zuhr in my house, then he would go out and lead the people in prayer, then he would come in and pray two rak`ahs. And he used to lead the people in Maghrib prayer, then he would come in and pray two rak`ahs. And he would lead the people in praying ‘Isha, then he would come into my house and pray two rak`ahs. And he would pray nine rak`ahs of night prayer (qiyam al-layl), including Witr. He would pray long prayers at night standing and long prayers at night sitting. If he recited Quran standing, he would bow and prostrate from a standing position and if he recited Quran whilst sitting he would bow and prostrate from a sitting position. Then when dawn came he would pray two rak`ahs.” (Narrated by Muslim. 730; there is a similar hadith narrated from Ibn ‘Umar in al-Sahihayn) 

Al-Nawawi said in his commentary: 
“This indicates that it is mustahabb to offer the regular nafl prayers in one's house, as is also the case with other nafl prayers. There is no difference of opinion among us on this point. This is the view of the majority and in our view and theirs, the nafl prayers connected to the obligatory prayers are the same whether they are done at night or during the day.” (Sharh Muslim, 6/9) 

Jabir said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you finishes his prayer in his mosque, let him give his house a share of his prayer, for Allah will create something good in his house from his prayer.” (Narrated by Muslim, 778) 

Al-Manawi said: 
“The phrase “When any one of you finishes his prayer in his mosque” means, performing the obligatory prayer in a place where it is offered in congregation. The mosque is mentioned because that is where the prayer is usually held. “Let him give his house” means the place where he lives. “A share” means a portion. “Of his prayer” means, let him do the obligatory prayers in the mosque and the nafl prayers in his house, to bring barakah (blessing) upon his house and family, as he says, “for Allah will create something good in his house from his prayer”, i.e., because of the prayer. “Something good” means a great deal of good, because he has furnished his house with the remembrance and obedience of Allah, and the presence and glad tidings of the angels, and the reward and barakah that he brings to his family. 
It also indicates that nafl prayers offered at home are better than those offered in the mosque, even in al-Masjid al-Haram.” (Fayd al-Qadir, 1/418) 
There is more evidence than this, for the regular nafl prayers of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), his night prayers (qiyam al-layl) and Duha prayer were all done in his house, but we have omitted (the reports concerning) that for the sake of brevity. What we have mentioned above is sufficient. Some of the scholars have stated that there is a reason for that: 
Ibn Qudamah said: 
“Offering voluntary prayers at home is preferable, because praying at home is closer to sincerity and furthest removed from showing off. It is an act that is done in secret, whereas doing it in the mosque is in public, and secrecy is better.” (Al-Mughni, 1/442) 
It also serves as a reminder to the forgetful and teaching of the ignorant among the members of the household or those who see him. 
Evidence for offering Eclipse prayer in the mosque
With regard to the evidence that it is mustahabb to offer the eclipse prayer in the mosque: 

Abu Bakrah said: We were with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when the sun was eclipsed. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) got up, dragging his lower garment, and entered the mosque. We entered too, and he led us in praying two rak`ahs until the sun had cleared. Then he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The sun and the moon do not become eclipsed for the death of anyone. If you see that then pray and make du`a until the eclipse is over.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 993) 

Evidence for offering Sunnah prayer before Jumu`ah in the mosque
With regard to the evidence that it is mustahabb to offer the nafl prayers before Jumu’ah in the mosque: 

Salman al-Farsi said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does ghusl on a Friday and purifies himself as much as he can, then puts oil (on his hair) and applies perfume, and does not force his way between two persons (assembled in the mosque for the Friday prayer), then prays as much has been decreed for him, then keeps quiet when the imam comes out (to deliver the khutbah), his sins between that Friday and the previous one will be forgiven.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 868)

    a number of places in the Qur’aan, for example the verses in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And know that Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, 
    Most Forbearing [Haleem]”
[al-Baqarah 2:235] 
“Kind words and forgiving of faults are 
    better than Sadaqah (charity) followed by injury. And Allaah is Rich (Free of all needs) and He is Most-Forbearing”
[al-Baqarah 2:263]
Ibn Jareer said in his Tafseer (4/144): “This means that He gives respite and does not 
    hasten to punish the one who disobeys Him or goes against His command.” 
Al-Khattaabi said in Sha’n al-Du’a’ 
    (63): “He is forgiving and grants respite, the One Whose anger does not overwhelm Him and Who is not provoked by the ignorance of the ignorant or 
    the disobedience of the disobedient. One who forgives when he is not able to punish does not deserve to be called Haleem (forbearing); rather the 
    one who is al-Haleem is the One Who forgives when He is able to punish and Who gives respite and does not hasten the punishment.” 
Qiwaam al-Sunnah al-Asbahaani said in 
    al-Hujjah fi Bayaan al-Mahajjah (1/144): “Forbearing towards the one who disobeys Him, because if He wanted to punish him at the time of the 
    sin, He could do so, but He grants him respite until the appointed time. Even though this is a name that may be applied to a person, the 
    forbearance of a person is not a quality with which a person is born and which then develops when he grows older; it may change at times of 
    sickness or anger, or because of events that happen. His attribute dies when he dies, but the forbearance of Allaah abides and never disappears. A 
    person may forgive one thing but not another; he may forgive those against whom he is powerless to exact revenge, but Allaah forgives even though 
    He is able to punish.” 
Ibn al-Qayyim said in al-Nooniyyah 
    (3278): 
“He is the Forbearing and does not hasten the punishment for His slave, (granting him respite) 
    so that he may repent from his sin.” 
Al-Sa’di said in his Tafseer (19):  
    “Al-Haleem is the One Who keeps bestowing blessings, both visible and hidden, on His creation, even though they disobey Him and make many 
    mistakes. So He forgives and does not give the sinners the punishment they deserve; He encourages them to repent and gives them time to turn to 
    Him.”.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
22216,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22216,Shar’i procedures when a wife rebels,What should a husband do if his wife rebels against him?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Ibn Qudaamah said: If a man fears rebellious behaviour on the part of his wife, because she shows signs of rebellion by not responding to his requests for intimacy, or she responds but does so reluctantly, then he should warn her and advise her to fear Allaah; he should remind her of what Allaah has enjoined upon her of duties and obedience, the sin involved in what she is doing and the rights of spending and clothing that she will lose, and the fact that he is permitted to hit her and forsake her in bed, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“As to those women on whose part you see ill-conduct, admonish them (first)”[al-Nisaa’ 4:34]
If she persists and shows signs of rebellion and refuses to share his bed, then he may forsake her in bed as much as he wishes, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“(next) refuse to share their beds”[al-Nisaa’ 4:34]
If she still persists, then he may hit her in a manner that does not cause harm, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“(and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful)”
[al-Nisaa’ 4:34]
The phrase (interpretation of the meaning): 
“If you fear a breach between them twain (the man and his wife)”
[al-Nisaa’ 4:35]
means, if it is known to have reached this stage, then the judge should send an arbitrator from his family and an arbitrator from hers, both of whom should be trustworthy, to decide either to reconcile and keep them together or to separate and divorce, and whatever they do will be binding upon them. That means that if the spouses reach the point of separation or enmity, the judge should appoint two free, Muslim arbitrators of good character, preferably from their families, with their approval and appointed by them, so that they can investigate the case and do what they think is best to reconcile them or to let them divorce by talaaq or khula’. Then whatever they do will be binding upon them. The basis for this is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning]

          Ibn Qudaamah said: If he marries a virgin, he should 
          stay with her for seven nights, then start alternating (between his 
          wives). If he marries a previously-married woman, then he should stay 
          with her for three nights. That is because Abu Qulaabah narrated that 
          Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “It is part of the Sunnah, 
          if a man marries a virgin after marrying a previously-married woman, 
          that he should stay with her for seven days, then start sharing his 
          time, and if he marries a previously-married woman, he should stay with

          If you wish, you may say that Anas attributed this to the Prophet

          Ibn Qudaamah said: It is recommended that he not take 
          from her more than he gave to her. If he does that, it is makrooh (disliked) 
          but it is still valid. This was narrated from ‘Uthmaan, Ibn ‘Umar and 
          Ibn ‘Abbaas, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “then there is no sin on either of them if she gives 
          back (the Mahr or a part of it) for her Al-Khul‘ (divorce)”
 
          [al-Baqarah 2:229]
 
          Al-Rabee’ bint Mu’awwidh said: I asked my husband for a divorce (khula’) 
          for everything except my head cover, and ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affaan permitted 
          me to do that. Such incidents become well known, (and as no one spoke 
          against it), thus there is consensus on this matter. Since this is proven 
          to be the case, then it is a permissible action, even though it is disliked 
          (makrooh), because it was narrated in the hadeeth of Jameelah: “So he 
          commanded him to take his garden back from her and no more than that.” 
          And it was narrated from ‘Ataa’ (from Ibn ‘Abbaas) that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) regarded it as makrooh to 
          take more from a wife divorced by khula’ than had been given to her. 
          So we may reconcile the aayah and the hadeeth by saying that the aayah 
          indicates that it is permissible to take more than was originally given, 
          and the prohibition on taking more in the report indicates that doing 
          this is makrooh.","al-‘Iddah Sharh al-‘Umdah, p. 482"

    The highest number of wives of Sulaymaan (peace be upon him) 
    that is mentioned in the saheeh ahaadeeth is one hundred, as was narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh (5242) from Abu Hurayrah who said: 
    “Sulaymaan ibn Dawood (peace be upon them both) said: ‘Tonight I will go 
    around to one hundred women, each of whom will give birth to a boy who will 
    fight for the sake of Allaah.’ The angel said to him, ‘Say in sha Allaah (if 
    Allaah wills).’ But he did not say it, as he forgot. He went around to them 
    but none of them gave birth, apart from one woman who gave birth to half a 
    child. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    ‘If he had said in sha Allaah, he would not have broken his oath and he 
    would have had more hope of fulfilling his wish.’” (Narrated by Muslim, 
    1654). According to another report narrated by Muslim, he said ninety women. 
    According to a mu’allaq report narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh, 
    in the Chapter on seeking a son for jihad (Man talaba al-walad 
    li’l-Jihaad), he said ninety-nine women. 

    Perhaps the one who said one hundred was rounding up the figure, and the one 
    who said ninety was rounding it down, as was suggested by al-Haafiz ibn 
    Hajar in his commentary on this hadeeth. 

    But al-Haafiz ibn Hajar narrated in his story of Sulaymaan 
    (peace be upon him) in al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah, vol. 2, from many 
    of the salaf, that the number of Sulaymaan’s wives was one thousand. 
    Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said likewise in Fath al-Baari, in his commentary 
    on hadeeth no. 3424. 

    This number was narrated from the Children of Israel [i.e., the Jews], so we 
    neither believe it nor disbelieve it. There is nothing in the ahaadeeth 
    quoted above to either prove or disprove that. 

    With regard to the reason for that, Allaah gives to those 
    whom He wills among His slaves whatever He wills of worldly power and 
    enjoyment. This is according to His great wisdom and grace. He is not to be 
    questioned about what He does, may He be glorified and praised. He gave to 
    Sulaymaan exclusively great power which He did not give to anyone after him. 
    So it is not far-fetched to suggest that He also gave him this great 
    strength which enabled him to marry this number of women. It should not 
    cross the mind of any Muslim that this matter implies any form of 
    belittlement towards this Prophet, rather it is a reflection of his perfect 
    power, virtue and manhood, and thus he hoped that Allaah would bless him, in 
    a single night, with one hundred sons, all of whom would go out as knights, 
    fighting for the sake of Allaah. But first and last we must believe that 
    Allaah creates whatever He wills and chooses, and none can overturn His 
    ruling or ward off His decree.

22232,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22232,Is Iblees a Jinn or an Angel?,Was Iblis one of the angels or one of the jinn? And are the jinn from among the angels?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad al-Ameen al-Shanqeeti (may Allah be pleased with him) said: 
Allah says in the following ayah/verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He [Iblis] was one of the jinn; he disobeyed the command of his Lord.” [18:50] 
The apparent meaning is that the reason for his disobedience of his Lord was the fact that he was one of the jinn. The conjunction fa in the Arabic text [kana min al-jinn fa-fasaqa ‘an amri Rabbihi] is indicative of the reason, as in the Arabic phrase saraqa fa quti’at yaduhu which means, “he stole, so his hand was cut off”, i.e., that was because he stole; or the phrase saha fa sajada which means, “he forgot so he prostrated”, i.e., that was because he forgot. The same pattern is seen in the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (as for) the male thief and the female thief, cut off [fa-qta’u] (from the wrist joint) their (right) hands.” [5:38] 
i.e., because of their stealing. 
Similarly, the phrase kana min al-jinn fa-fasaqa (he was one of the jinn [so] he disobeyed …) means that this was because he was in essence one of the jinn, because this feature is what made him different from the angels, for they obeyed the command but he disobeyed. Because of the apparent meaning of this ayah, a number of scholars were of the opinion that Iblis was not originally one of the angels, rather he was one of the jinn, but he used to worship Allah with them, so he was called by their name because he followed them, just as an ally of a tribe may be given their name. The dispute as to whether Iblis was originally an angel whom Allah changed into a devil, or whether he was not originally an angel but was included in the word malaikah (angels) because he had joined them and worshipped Allah with them, is a well known dispute among the scholars. The evidence of those who say that he was not originally one of the angels is based on two things: 
1 – The fact that angels are protected against committing kufr (disbelief) as was committed by Iblis, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Who disobey not, (from executing) the commands they receive from Allah, but do that which they are commanded.” [66:6] 
“They speak not until He has spoken, and they act on His Command.” [21:27] 
2 – Allah clearly states in 18:50 that he was one of the jinn, and the jinn are not angels. They said: this is a Quranic text concerning which there is some dispute.
Among those who stated that he was not originally one of the angels based on the apparent meaning of this ayah was-Hasan al-Basri, who was supported by al-Zamakhshari in his tafsir (exegesis). 
Al-Qurtubi said in his tafsir of Surat al-Baqarah: “The idea that he was one of the angels is the view of the majority, Ibn ‘Abbas, Ibn Mas’ud, Ibn Jurayj, Ibn al-Musayyib, Qutadah and others. It is the view chosen by al-Shaykh Abu’l-Hasan and regarded as more correct by al-Tabari, and it is the apparent meaning of the phrase “except Iblis.” [18:50] 
What the mufassirin (Quranic exegetists) have quoted from a group of the salaf (righteous predecessors), such as Ibn ‘Abbas and others, that he was one of the noblest of the angels, one of the keepers of Paradise, and that he controlled the affairs of the first heaven, and that his name was ‘Azazil is all taken from the Israliyyat (reports narrated from Jewish sources) and is not reliable. 
The clearest evidence concerning this matter, the evidence cited by those who said that he was not an angel because of the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He [Ibls] was one of the jinn; he disobeyed the command of his Lord,” [18:50] is the clearest text from the revelation that proves this point.

    clearly contradicts this aayah as you can see. Everything that clearly 
    contradicts the Qur’aan is undoubtedly false. But there is no clear text 
    concerning the way in which his offspring come into being, whether that is 
    through marriage or otherwise, and the scholars differed concerning this 
    matter. Al- Shu’bi said: A man asked me whether Iblees has a wife? I said, 
    “That is a wedding party I never attended!”, then I remembered the aayah 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Will you then take him (Iblees) and his offspring as 
    protectors and helpers rather than Me…?”[al-Kahf 18:50]
Then I realized that he 
    could not have offspring unless he had a wife, so I said, Yes. 
Something similar to what 
    al-Shu’bi understood from this aayah, that having offspring implies having a 
    wife, was also narrated from Qutaadah. Mujaahid said: the way in which his 
    offspring came into being is that he inserted his private part into his 
    private part, then he laid five eggs, and this was the origin of his 
    offspring. Some of the scholars said that Allaah created a penis on his 
    right thigh and a vagina on his left thigh, so he impregnates himself in 
    this manner and ten eggs are laid every day, from each of which emerge 
    seventy male and female devils. 
It is obvious that these 
    views are unreliable, because they are not supported by any text in the 
    Qur’aan or Sunnah. The aayah indicates that he has offspring, but as to how 
    these offspring are born, there is no reliable text concerning that, and 
    such matters cannot be known through mere opinions. 
Al-Qurtubi said in his 
    commentary on this aayah: I say: what is proven in saheeh reports concerning 
    this matter is that which was narrated by al-Humaydi in al-Jam’ bayna 
    al-Saheehayn from Imaam Abu Bakr al-Burqaani, who narrated in his book 
    with an isnaad from Abu Muhammad ‘Abd al-Ghani ibn Sa’eed al-Haafiz from the 
    report of ‘Aasim from Abu ‘Uthmaan from Salmaan that the Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do not be the first 
    one to enter the market-place or the last one to leave, for there the 
    Shaytaan lays his eggs and there they hatch.” This indicates that the 
    Shaytaan has offspring from his loins. 
Those who interpreted 
    this report literally (may Allaah forgive them) said that this hadeeth 
    indicates that he (the Shaytaan) lays eggs and that they hatch. But there is 
    nothing to indicate that these eggs are from a female, namely his wife, or 
    otherwise. This hadeeth may be interpreted differently, because the Arabs 
    often speak of laying eggs and hatching them by way of metaphor. So the 
    words “he lays his eggs and they hatch” may be interpreted as meaning that 
    he does whatever he wants to misguide and tempt people, and whisper 
    insinuating thoughts to them, and so on, as a metaphor. The wording of 
    metaphors does not change, regardless of the context.","Adwaa’ al-Bayaan, 4/133-135"

    whom He sends astray, for him you will find no Wali (guiding friend) to lead

    In this aayah, Allaah explains that guidance and misguidance 
    are in His hand alone; whomsoever He guides none can lead astray, and 
    whomsoever He sends astray, none can guide. This meaning is also expressed 
    in many other aayahs, such as the following (interpretation of the

    whom He sends astray, for him you will find no Wali (guiding friend) to lead

     “Verily, you (O Muhammad) guide not whom you like, but

    “And whomsoever Allaah wants to put in Al-Fitnah (error, 
    because of his rejecting of Faith), you can do nothing for him against 
    Allaah”

    [al-Maa’idah 5:41] 

    “If you (O Muhammad) covet for their guidance, then 
    verily, Allaah guides not those whom He makes to go astray (or none can 
    guide him whom Allaah sends astray). And they will have no helpers”

    Allaah but rather by the will of the person, is false. Glorified and exalted

What is meant in the aayah
“…who do righteous deeds…”
[al-Kahf 18:2 – interpretation of the meaning]
 is explained in other aayahs which indicate that a deed cannot be righteous unless it meets three conditions:
1 – It must be done in accordance with that which was brought by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Every action that goes against that which was brought by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is not righteous, rather it is false. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad) gives you, take it” [al-Hashr 59:7]
“He who obeys the Messenger (Muhammad), has indeed obeyed Allah” [al-Nisa’ 4:10]
“Or have they partners with Allah (false gods) who have instituted for them a religion which Allah has not ordained?” [al-Shoora 42:21]
and there are many similar aayahs.
2 – The one who does it must be sincere in his intention towards Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him)” al-Bayyinah :5]
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘Verily, I am commanded to worship Allah (Alone) by obeying Him and doing religious deeds sincerely for His sake only.
And I am commanded (this) in order that I may be the first of those who submit themselves to Allah (in Islam) as Muslims.’
Say (O Muhammad): ‘Verily, if I disobey my Lord, I am afraid of the torment of a great Day.’
Say (O Muhammad): ‘Allah Alone I worship by doing religious deeds sincerely for His sake only (and not to show off, and not to set up rivals with Him in worship).’
So worship what you like besides Him’” [al-Zumar 39:11-15]
and there are many similar aayahs.
3 – It must be done on the basis of faith and sound belief, because the action is the roof and the belief (‘aqeedah) is the foundation. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Whoever works righteousness — whether male or female — while he (or she) is a true believer…”
[al-Nahl 16:97]
So faith is described as the prerequisite for that.
The concept of this prerequisite is explained in many places, such as when Allah describes the actions of non-believers:
“And We shall turn to whatever deeds they (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners) did, and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust” [al-Furqaan 25:23]
“their [disbelievers’] deeds are like a mirage in a desert” [al-Noor 24:39]
“their [disbelievers’]works are as ashes, on which the wind blows furiously on a stormy day” [Ibraaheem 14:18]

It should be noted that we must differentiate between man-made systems the implementation of which implies disbelief (kufr) in the Creator of the heavens and the earth, and systems which do not imply that. This may be explained by describing systems as being of two types, administrative and legislative. With regard to administrative systems which are aimed at organizing things and making them run smoothly in a manner that does not go against sharee’ah, there is nothing wrong with this and no one among the Sahaabah or those who came after them objected to it. ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) did many things of that nature that were not done at the time of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), such as writing down the names of the soldiers in a register to keep track of who was present and who was absent, even though the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not do that and he had not known that Ka’b ibn Maalik was not present during the campaign of Tabook until after he had reached Tabook. Similarly, ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) bought the house of Safwaan ibn Umayyah in Makkah and turned it into a prison, even though neither the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) nor Abu Bakr had established a prison. Such administrative matters which are intended to make things run smoothly and which do not go against sharee’ah – such as organizing employees’ affairs and organizing work matters in a manner that does not go against sharee’ah – is a kind of man-made system that is o.k. and does not go against the basic principles of sharee’ah which aims to take care of the public interest. 
But in the case of legislative systems which go against the laws of the Creator of the heavens and the earth, referring to them for judgement constitutes disbelief (kufr) in the Creator of the heavens and the earth, such as claiming that giving males precedence over  females in matters of inheritance is not fair and that they should be given equal shares, or claiming that plural marriage is a form of oppression, or that divorce is unjust towards women, or that stoning and cutting off hands etc. are barbaric actions that cannot justifiably be done to anyone, and so on. 
So implementing this kind of system to govern people’s lives, wealth, honour, lineage, minds and religion constitutes disbelief in the Creator of the heavens and the earth, and rebellion against the divine system which was set up by the One Who created all of mankind and Who knows best what is in its interests. Glorified and exalted be He far above having any other legislator alongside Him. 
“Or have they partners with Allaah (false gods) who have instituted for them a religion which Allaah has not ordained?

“Say (O Muhammad, to these polytheists): ‘Tell me, what provision Allaah has sent down to you! And you have made of it lawful and unlawful.’ Say (O Muhammad): ‘Has Allaah permitted you (to do so), or do you invent a lie against Allaah?’”

We also know that Allaah does not force anyone into kufr, so how can we understand these aayahs?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Shaykh al-Shanqeeti (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:  

    The answer is that Allaah has explained in many verses of His 
    Book those impediments which have been placed on their hearts, ears and 
    eyes, such as seals and veils, have been placed on them as a suitable 
    recompense for their previous kufr and for their disbelieving in the 
    Messengers by choice. So Allaah has turned their hearts away by placing upon 
    them a seal and veils etc, as a punishment for their kufr. Among the aayahs 
    that indicate that is the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Allaah has set a seal upon their hearts because of their 
    disbelief”

    [al-Nisaa’ 4:155]

    This a clear Qur’aanic text which states that their previous 
    kufr is the reason for the seal upon their hearts. And Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “So when they turned away (from the path of Allaah), 
    Allaah turned their hearts away (from the Right Path)”

    [al-Saff 61:5]

    This is also a clear indication that the reason why Allaah 
    has turned their hearts away is their initial turning away. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “That is because they believed, and then disbelieved; 
    therefore their hearts are sealed, so they understand not”

    [al-Munaafiqoon :3] 

    “In their hearts is a disease (of doubt and hypocrisy) and 
    Allaah has increased their disease”

    [al-Baqarah 2:10]

    and evil deeds) which they used to earn”

    [al-Mutaffifeen 83:14]

    and there are other aayahs which speak of the seal on their 
    hearts and say that their being prevented from understanding that which may 
    benefit them is a punishment for their previous kufr. What we have mentioned

          batiniyyah (esoteric teachings) wanted to follow a path that did not 
          enjoin these shar’i rulings. They said: these general shar’i rulings 
          are obligatory upon the Prophets and the masses only. As for the awliyaa’ 
          and the elite, they do not need those texts. Rather what is required 
          of them is what they receive in their hearts through intuition and the 
          thoughts that dominate their minds. They said: this is because their 
          hearts are free of anything that may cause distraction and of thoughts 
          of anything other than Allaah. In this manner divine knowledge becomes 
          manifest to them, and they discover the secrets of creation and learn 
          the rulings concerning minor issues, thus they are no longer subjected 
          to the holistic shar’i rulings. This is what happened in the case of 
          al-Khidr who, by means of the knowledge that was made manifest to him 
          was rendered independent of the knowledge that Moosa had. One of the 
          things that they narrated was the words: “Consult your heart, no matter 
          how many people give you fatwas and advice.” 
 
          Our shaykh (may Allaah 
          be pleased with him) said: These are the words of heresy and kufr; the 
          one who says them should be executed without being asked to repent, 
          because he has denied that which is known from the sharee’ah. For Allaah 
          has set up the system by His wisdom in such a way that His rulings can 
          only be known through His Messengers who are ambassadors between Him 
          and His creation. They are the only ones who convey His Message and 
          His words from Him, explaining His laws and rulings, and He has chosen 
          them for that purpose.
 
          Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “Allaah chooses Messengers from angels and from men. 
          Verily, Allaah is All-Hearer, All-Seer”

          “Mankind were one community and Allaah sent Prophets 
          with glad tidings and warnings”[al-Baqarah 2:213]
 
          and there are other similar aayahs. 
 
          In conclusion, we know definitely and for certain, and 
          the consensus of the earlier and later generations states likewise, 
          that there is no way to learn the rulings of Allaah, which have to do 
          with His commands and prohibitions, except through His Messengers. Whoever 
          says that there is another way through which His commands and prohibitions 
          may be known, independently of the Messengers, is a kaafir who should 
          be executed without asking him to repent; there is no need to question 
          him. For this is stating belief in Prophets after our Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), whom Allaah has made the 
          Seal of the Prophets and Messengers, after whom there is no Prophet 
          or Messenger.  
 
          What that means is that 
          whoever says that he has taken the ruling of Allaah from his heart or 
          from what he received in his heart through intuition, and that he acts 
          upon that and thus has no need of the Qur’aan or Sunnah, has claimed 
          for himself the unique qualities of Prophethood, because this is like 
          what the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Holy Spirit [i.e.,

          as forbidden that which it forbade, adhering to its etiquette, learning 
          lessons from its stories, and adhering to it in all other ways. Most 
          of the mufassireen say that what is meant here by al-kitaab (the 
          Scripture) is the Tawraat (Torah). 
 
          “And We gave him wisdom while yet a child”
 
          [Maryam 19:12 – interpretation of the meaning]
 
          The scholars have a number of opinions as to what is 
          meant by wisdom, all of which are close in meaning and refer to one 
          thing, which is that Allaah gave him understanding of the Scripture, 
          so that he understood it and acted upon it whilst he was still a child. 
 
          “And (made him) sympathetic to men”
 
          [Maryam 19:13 – interpretation of the meaning]
 
          This is mentioned in conjunction with wisdom, i.e., We 
          gave him sympathy (or compassion) from Us. Hanaan (sympathy, 
          compassion) means the mercy, compassion and empathy that was instilled 
          in him. The word hanaan is widely used among the Arabs to refer 
          to mercy and compassion, for example, they say, “Hanaanak wa hanaaneeka 
          yaa Rabb”, meaning, I ask for Your mercy O Lord. 
 
          “and pure from sins”
 
          [Maryam 19:13 – interpretation of the meaning]
 
          This is mentioned in conjunction with the above, and 
          means, ‘We gave him purity’ i.e., he was free from sin and disobedience 
          because he obeyed Allaah and drew close to Him by means of that which 
          pleases Him. 
 
          “and he was righteous”
 
          [Maryam 19:13 – interpretation of the meaning]
 
          This means, he obeyed the commands of his Lord and avoided 
          that which He forbade. So he never committed any sin and was never blamed 
          for any such action. 
 
          “And dutiful towards his parents”
 
          [Maryam 19:14 – interpretation of the meaning]
 
          The word barr (dutiful) refers to one who does 
          acts of kindness, i.e., We made him honour his parents a great deal, 
          i.e., he was very kind towards them and treated them in a gentle manner. 
 
          “and he was neither arrogant nor disobedient”
 
          [Maryam 19:14 – interpretation of the meaning]
 
          This means that he was not too arrogant to obey Allaah 
          or to obey his parents. Rather he was obedient towards Allaah and humble 
          towards his parents. This is the view of Ibn Jareer. Jabbaar 
          (arrogant) means one who is very oppressive towards people and mistreats 
          them. Everyone who is arrogant towards people and does them wrong is 
          described as jabbaar. 
 
          “And Salaam (peace) be on him the day he was born, 
          and the day he dies, and the day he will be raised up to life (again)!”
 
          [Maryam 19:15 – interpretation of the meaning]
 
          Ibn Jareer said: “Salaam (peace) be upon him means”, 
          may he be safe and secure. The apparent meaning is that “And Salaam 
          (peace) be on him the day he was born” is a greeting from Allaah 
          to Yahyaa, and the meaning is safety and security. 
 
          In Soorat Aal ‘Imraan Allaah says (interpretation of 
          the meaning): 
 
          “… noble, keeping away from sexual relations with 
          women, a Prophet, from among the righteous”[Aal ‘Imraan 3:39]
 
          The word sayyid (translated here as “noble”) 
          means one who is obeyed and followed by a large number of people. 
 
          The word husoor (translated here as “keeping 
          away from sexual relations with women”) means that he kept himself 
          away from women even though he was able to have relations with them, 
          as an act of devotion to Allaah. That was permissible according to his 
          law, but the Sunnah of the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is to marry, not to remain 
          celibate… 
 
          In the phrase “a Prophet, from among the righteous”, 
          the word Nabi (Prophet) is derived from the word naba’, meaning 
          important news, because the Revelation is important news from Allaah. 
          The righteous are those whose belief, actions, words and intentions 
          are correct. Righteousness is the opposite of immorality or corruption. 
          Allaah described Yahyaa as righteous and He described the Prophets in 
          a similar manner in Soorat al-An’aam, where He says (interpretation 
          of the meaning): 
 
          “And Zakariyya (Zachariya), and Yahya (John) and ‘Eesa 
          (Jesus) and Ilyaas (Elias), each one of them was of the righteous”

          If the muezzin gives the adhaan for Zuhr or ‘Asr, and the traveler sets 
          out and passes the city limits, then he is allowed to shorten the four-rak’ah

Rather it is permissible for the traveler to combine Zuhr and ‘Asr only, at the time of either of them, before the sun starts to set, and to combine Maghrib and ‘Ishaa’ at the time of either of them, before midnight. With regard to Fajr, it cannot be joined to any other prayer, rather it should always be prayed on time, whether one is traveling or not, before the sun rises.

He said, “If you say to your companion on Friday, ‘Listen!’ when the imaam is preaching, then you have engaged in idle speech.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Jumu’ah, 882; Muslim, al-Jumu’ah, 1404. Agreed upon). 
He described his enjoining something good as being “idle speech” (laghw) at the time of the khutbah, so how about other kinds of speech? And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, according to a saheeh hadeeth, “Whoever plays with the pebbles (on the ground) has engaged in idle speech (laghw).” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Jumu’ah, 1419) 
At Jumu’ah prayers, the believer should listen to the khutbah and be humble and solemn, he should beware of playing with pebbles on the ground or anything else. If someone greets him he should gesture to him without speaking. If he puts his hand in his when he offers his hand, without speaking, that is OK, as stated above. He should tell him after the khutbah that he should not have done that, and that which is prescribed if one comes in when the imaam is preaching is to pray two rak’ahs to “greet the mosque” and not to say salaams to anyone until after the khutbah has ended. If he sneezes he should praise Allah (say “al-hamdu Lillah”) to himself without speaking out loud.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), part 12, p. 410"

Is this action permitted or not?","Praying Zuhr after Jumu`ah is a bid`ah and a going astray, instituting a new way which Allah has not prescribed. We must not do this; we must beware of it and warn people against it","Do You Have to Pray Zuhr after Jumu`ah?


Source of waswas","Praise be to Allah.Do You Have to Pray Zuhr after Jumu`ah?
“It is a well-established fact in Islam (such that no Muslim has any excuse for not knowing), and the shar’i evidence indicates, that Allah has not prescribed any prayer at noon time on Fridays except one obligatory prayer for men who are residents and are settled (i.e., not traveling), free and accountable, which is Jumu`ah prayer .
If the Muslims offer Jumu`ah prayer, then there is no other obligation upon them, be it Zuhr or any other prayer . Jumu`ah prayer is the obligation of that time. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), and the righteous salaf who came after them, did not pray any other obligatory prayer after Jumu`ah. 
The action to which you refer was introduced many centuries later, and undoubtedly it is one of the newly-invented innovations of which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Beware of newly-invented matters, for every newly-invented matter is an innovation, and every innovation is a going astray.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 3991) 
Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also said: “Whoever innovates something in this matter of ours [Islam] that is not part of it will have it rejected.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim)
Undoubtedly praying Zuhr after Jumu`ah is something innovated which is not a part of the matter of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so it is to be rejected and is to be included in the innovations and misguidance against which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned us. 
The scholars have drawn attention to that, including Shaykh Jamal al-Din al-Qasimi, in his book Islah al-Maaajid min al-Bida’ wa’l-‘Awaid and Shaykh Muhammad Ahmad ‘Abd al-Salam in his book al-Sunan wa’l-Mubtada’at. 
If someone were to say, “We only do that in order to be on the safe side, lest our Jumu`ah prayer was not valid,” our answer is that he should be told that the basic principle is that the Jumu`ah prayer is valid and is sound and that it is not obligatory to pray Zuhr, indeed it is not permissible to do so at the time of Jumu`ah for those for whom Jumu`ah is obligatory. 
Being on the safe side is prescribed in cases where the way of the Sunnah is not clear, and there is some doubt and uncertainty. But in a case such as this it is not the matter of doubt; rather we know from the evidence that what is obligatory is Jumu`ah prayer only, so it is not permissible to do something else instead or in addition to it on the grounds that this is an action with the intention of being on the safe side, or to institute a new way which Allah has not prescribed. 
Praying Zuhr at this time is contrary to the shar’i evidence which is well established and no Muslim has any excuse for not knowing, so we must not do this and we must beware of it. 
Source of waswas
There are no grounds for doing this, rather it comes from the waswas (insinuating whispers) of the Shaytan which he whispers to people so as to prevent them from following true guidance and institutes for them a religion which Allah has not allowed. 
This is similar to the way in which he makes the idea of “being on the safe side” when doing wudu attractive to them, until he makes wudu a torment for them, and it takes all their time; whenever they have almost finished, he whispers to them  that they have not done it properly or they have not done such and such. 
He does the same thing to some of them in the prayer; when a person says takbir for the prayer, he whispers to him that he did not say the takbir, and he keeps whispering to him that he did not say takbir, and the person keeps on saying takbir after takbir, until the first rak`ah is over, or until the recitation or most of it is over. 
This is one of the traps and snares of the Shaytan , who is keen to annul the good deeds of the Muslim and make him confused about his religion. We ask Allah to keep us and all the Muslims safe and sound from his traps, snares and insinuating whispers, for He is the All-Hearing, Ever-Near.
To conclude, praying Zuhr after Jumu`ah is a bid`ah and a going astray, instituting a new way which Allah has not prescribed. We must not do this; we must beware of it and warn people against it, and limit ourselves to doing Jumu`ah prayer only, as was the way of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), his Companions after him and those who have followed them in truth until the present day. 
This is the truth concerning which there is no doubt. Imam Malik ibn Anas (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The later generations of this ummah will not be reformed by anything except that by which the first generation was reformed.” This was also the view of other imams after him.

          the dead at night are to be interpreted as referring to cases where 
          burying a person at night may lead to the prayers for him not being 
          offered properly, as was stated in the saheeh hadeeth, or his shrouding 
          not being done properly, and it is easier for those who want to attend 
          the funeral to do so during the day, and it is easier to bury him properly 
          and to follow the Sunnah when placing the deceased in the lahd during 
          the day.  This is in cases where it is not essential to hasten 
          to bury him. Otherwise we should hasten to bury him even if that is 
          at night.

What should he do?",,,"Praise be to Allah.He should complete the janaazah prayer and recite the three takbeers to make up what he has missed before the coffin is taken away, then he should say the salaam. The part of the prayer where he caught up with the imaam is considered to be the first part of his prayer, and it is sufficient for him to say the minimum of what is required after the second and third takbeers. After the second takbeer he may say, “Allaahumma salli ‘ala Muhammad (O Allaah, send blessings upon Muhammad)” and after the third takbeer he should say, “Allaahumma ighfir lahu (O Allaah, have mercy on him).” And he should say salaam after the fourth takbeer.

        It is known that the reports from the Children of Israel 
          [the Jews], which are known as al-Israa’eeliyyaat, may be of three kinds:
        1 – those which we have to believe in, which are those 
          which are shown by the Qur’aan or the sound Sunnah to be true
        2 – Those which we have to disbelieve in, which are those 
          which are shown by the Qur’aan and Sunnah to be false.
        3 – Those which we are permitted neither to believe nor 
          disbelieve, which are those which are not proven in the Qur’aan or Sunnah 
          to be either true or false.
        From this definition we know that with regard to the 
          stories which contradict the Qur’aan and saheeh Sunnah, which are in 
          circulation among them now, claiming that they are from the revealed 
          scriptures, we must reject them because they go against the texts of 
          the sound Revelation which has not been distorted or altered [i.e., 
          the Qur’aan]. And Allaah knows best.","Adwaa’ al-Bayaan, 4/203, 204"

Is there any basis for this?","There is no basis for regarding ringing in the ears as good or bad omen in Islam. The Muslim has to put his trust in Allah. Regarding things as bad omens is a kind of belief in evil omens, which Prophet Muhammad declared to be false and stated that it is a form of polytheism.",,"Praise be to Allah.There is no basis for regarding ringing in the ears as good or bad omen in Islam. The Muslim has to put his trust in Allah. Regarding things as bad omens is a kind of belief in evil omens, which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) declared to be false and stated that it is a form of polytheism. 
If a person notices any such thing (ringing in the ears, etc.), he should ignore it and go ahead with his plans, and not hesitate. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Tiyarah (superstition) is that which makes you go ahead or refrain.”
The Muslim should also recite the following Du`a: “Allahumma la yu`ti bi’l-hasanat illa anta wa la yadfa` as-sayi’at illa anta, wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa bika (O Allah, none can bring good things except You, and none can ward off evil things except You, and there is no power and no strength except with You).”
As for seeing something and interpreting it in an optimistic manner, this is good, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to like optimism. Optimism means thinking well of Allah.

22293,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22293,He has stopped advising people for fear of showing off,"I am afraid of showing off, and I am cautious about it to the extent that I cannot advise some people or forbid them from doing certain things such as backbiting, slandering, etc. I am afraid that doing so would be showing off on my part, and I am scared that people may think that I am showing off. So I do not give any advice, and I tell myself that they are educated people and they do not need any advice. What do you suggest?",,,"Praise be to Allah.This is one of the plots of the Shaytaan by means of which he discourages people from calling others to Allah and from enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil. For example, he makes them think that this is a kind of showing off or that people will think he is showing off. You, my sister in Islam, should not pay any attention to it, rather you should advise your sisters and your brothers if you see them falling short in any duty or committing any sin such as backbiting, slandering, or not covering in front of men. Do not be afraid of showing off, rather focus your intention on Allah and be sincere towards Him, and be of good cheer. Ignore the plots and whispers of the Shaytaan. Allah knows what intention is in your heart and how sincere you are towards Him and towards His slaves. Allah knows that showing off is shirk and it is not permissible, but it is also not permissible for a believer, man or woman, to stop doing what Allah has enjoined, namely calling people to Him and enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, for fear of showing off. So you have to beware of that and do what is obligatory in the midst of men and women. Men and women are equal in this regard. Allah has explained this in His Book where He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The believers, men and women, are Awliyaa’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); they perform As-Salah (Iqaamat-as-Salah), and give the Zakah, and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah will have His Mercy on them. Surely, Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise” [al-Tawbah 9:71]","Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz in al-Fataawa al-Jaami’ah li’l-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, p. 1016"
22297,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22297,Agent taking payment for doing something on behalf of another,Is it permissible for an agent who does something on behalf of another to take payment for his work?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It is permissible to appoint an agent with or without 
    payment. The evidence for appointing an agent without payment is that the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) appointed Unays to 
    carry out the hadd punishment on a woman, and he appointed ‘Urwah al-Baariqi 
    to buy a sheep, without paying them for that. There are many similar 
    examples in the ahaadeeth apart from those that we have mentioned.  

    The evidence for appointing an agent with payment is the 
    aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“As-Sadaqaat 
    (here it means Zakaah) are only for the Fuqaraa’ (poor), and Al-Masaakeen 
    (the poor) and those employed to collect (the funds)…”

    [al-Tawbah 9:60]

    so those who are appointed to collect and distribute the zakaah are given a share of it as you can see.","Adwaa’ al-Bayaan, 4/54"
22298,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22298,The benefit of the parables in the Qur’aan,We see many parables coined in the Qur’aan. What is the benefit of these parables?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh al-Shanqeeti (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And indeed We have put forth every kind of example in this Qur’aan, for mankind. But, man is ever more quarrelsome than anything” [al-Kahf 18:54] 
In this and similar parables in the Qur’aan there are great lessons and rebukes which make the truth clear, but no one can understand their meaning except people who have knowledge, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And these similitudes We put forward for mankind; but none will understand them except those who have knowledge (of Allaah and His Signs)” [al-‘Ankaboot 29:43] 
Part of the wisdom behind putting forth these parables is to make people think, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):                                                                                                  
“Such are the parables which We put forward to mankind that they may reflect” [al-Hashr 59:21] 
Elsewhere Allaah explains that by means of these parables and their explanation of the truth, Allaah guides some people and sends others astray, as He says in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, Allaah is not ashamed to set forth a parable even of a mosquito or so much more when it is bigger (or less when it is smaller) than it. And as for those who believe, they know that it is the Truth from their Lord, but as for those who disbelieve, they say: ‘What did Allaah intend by this parable?’ By it He misleads many, and many He guides thereby. And He misleads thereby only those who are Al-Faasiqoon (the rebellious, disobedient to Allaah” [al-Baqarah 2:26] 
Undoubtedly those who respond to their Lord are those who are wise and who ponder the meaning of the parables and they benefit from the explanation of the truth contained therein; those who do not respond to Him are those who do not ponder their meanings, and they do not understand the truths that are explained to them. 
The first group are those of whom Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and many He guides thereby” [al-Baqarah 2:26] 
The second group are those of whom He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“By it He misleads many” [al-Baqarah 2:26] 
And He says of them (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And He misleads thereby only those who are Al-Faasiqoon (the rebellious, disobedient to Allaah” [al-Baqarah 2:26]”","Adwaa’ al-Bayaan, 4/143, 144"
