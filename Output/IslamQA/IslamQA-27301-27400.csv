27302,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/27302,A Muslim whose kaafir family are threatening to hang him because of his being Muslim,"I am a Muslim but my family are kaafirs. What should I do with them, when they did not accept me being Muslim and want me to go back to their religion, and they are threatening to hang me? What should I do?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.First of all I would like to give you the glad tidings of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “There will come a time when the person who is patient in adhering to his religion will be like one who holds on to a life coal.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi from Anas; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani because of corroborating reports. See al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 957 
We ask Allaah to make you steadfast in adhering to the truth and not to let the blame of anyone or the evil of any wrongdoer affect you. Remember the words of Allaah to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): 
“but beware of them lest they turn you (O Muhammad) far away from some of that which Allaah has sent down to you”
[al-Maa'idah 5:49 – interpretation of the meaning]
I advise you to flee for the sake of your religion to a place where you can find people to help you follow the truth. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He who emigrates (from his home) in the Cause of Allaah, will find on earth many dwelling places and plenty to live by. And whosoever leaves his home as an emigrant unto Allaah and His Messenger, and death overtakes him, his reward is then surely, incumbent upon Allaah. And Allaah is Ever Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Nisa’ 4:100]
At the same time, you should pray for your family and ask Allaah to guide them and open their hearts to Islam. 
Finally, I ask Allaah to make the Muslims happy by supporting Islam and helping the believers and humiliating the kaafirs. May Allaah guide your family to Islam.",Islam Q&A
27303,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/27303,He made a vow if a certain thing happened and it did not happen; and the punishment for not fulfilling a vow,What is the status of a promise made to Allah that if this happens then i shall do this and the thing hasnt happened as yet? If that promise is not fulfilled what is its punishment?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    A vow that is conditional upon a certain thing happening is 
    not binding unless that thing happens, such as if a person vowed to give 
    charity or fast if his sick loved one was healed – he does not have to do 
    anything until the sick person is recovered.  

    His vow must be fulfilled according to scholarly consensus, 
    because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Whoever vows to obey Allaah, let him obey Him, and whoever vows to disobey 
    Him let him not disobey Him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6318. 

    Ibn Qudaamah said concerning vows to do acts of obedience or 
    worship:  

    “These are of three types, one of which is doing the acts of 
    worship in return for a blessing bestowed or a harm warded off, such as if a 
    person says, ‘If Allaah heals me, then I will fast one month for Allaah.’ So 
    this act of worship becomes binding because it is obligatory in principle in 
    sharee’ah, like fasting, prayer, charity and Hajj, and it is obligatory to 
    fulfil this vow according to scholarly consensus.” 

    Al-Mughni, 13/622 

    So fulfilling the vow becomes a debt owed by that person 
    until he fulfils it, and if he decided to neglect it then he is a sinner. 

    There is the fear that if he does not do it, Allaah may 
    punish him by instilling hypocrisy in his heart. Allaah says (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 

    “And of them are some who made a covenant with Allaah 
    (saying): ‘If He bestowed on us of His Bounty, we will verily, give Sadaqah 
    (Zakaah and voluntary charity in Allaah’s Cause) and will be certainly among 
    those who are righteous.’
Then when He gave them 
    of His Bounty, they became niggardly [refused to pay the Sadaqah (Zakaah or 
    voluntary charity)], and turned away, averse.

    So He punished them by putting hypocrisy into their hearts 
    till the Day whereon they shall meet Him, because they broke that (covenant 
    with Allaah) which they had promised to Him and because they used to tell 
    lies.

    Know they not that Allaah knows their secret ideas, and 
    their Najwa (secret counsels), and that Allaah is the All-Knower of things 
    unseen”

    [al-Tawbah 9:75-78]

    See question no. (42178) 

    It should be noted that making vows is makrooh, because of 
    the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (6608) and Muslim (1639) from Ibn ‘Umar 
    (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade making vows and said: “They do not 
    change anything, they only make a stingy person give (in charity).”

27304,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/27304,Ruling on talking to women at work,Sometimes I have to talk to some of the women [at work] and discuss with them some issues that have to do with work. Is there any sin on me for that? Is it permissible for me to work in this company or should I look for another job?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.There can be no doubt that the fitnah (temptation) of women is great. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “I have not left behind me any fitnah that is more harmful to men than women.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4808; Muslim, 2704. Hence the Muslim has to be cautious of this fitnah and keep away from anything that may cause him to fall prey to it. Some of the greatest causes of this fitnah are looking at women and mixing with them. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts). That is purer for them. Verily, Allah is All‑Aware of what they do.
And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent (like both eyes for necessity to see the way, or outer palms of hands or one eye or dress like veil, gloves, headcover, apron), and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms) and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband’s fathers, or their sons, or their husband’s sons, or their brothers or their brother’s sons, or their sister’s sons, or their (Muslim) women (i.e. their sisters in Islam), or the (female) slaves whom their right hands possess, or old male servants who lack vigour, or small children who have no sense of feminine sex. And let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment. And all of you beg Allah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful” [al-Noor 24:30-31] 
Here Allah commands His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to tell the believing men and women to lower their gaze and guard their chastity, then He explains that that is purer for them.
It is known that guarding one’s chastity and avoiding immoral actions is achieved only by avoiding the means that lead to such actions. Undoubtedly letting one’s gaze wander and mixing of men and women in the workplace and elsewhere are among the greatest means that lead to immorality. 
These two things that are required of the believer cannot be fulfilled when he is working with non-mahram women as colleagues or partners at work. 
Undoubtedly his working with her or her working with him in the work place is a situation in which it is impossible to lower one’s gaze and guard one's chastity and attain purity of soul. 
Hence Allah commanded the believing women to lower their gaze, guard their chastity and not show their adornment except only that which is apparent, and Allah commanded them to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms), which implies covering the head and face, because the jayb (pl. juyoob) is the site of the head and face. 
So how can one lower one’s gaze, guard one’s chastity and avoid showing one’s adornment when women go to men’s workplaces and mix with them?  Mixing will inevitably lead to falling into these haraam actions. 
How can the Muslim woman lower her gaze when she is with a non-mahram man all the time, claiming that he is her work colleague and she is his equal with regard to work.
Khatr Mushaarikat al-Mar’ah li’l-Rajul fi Maydaan ‘Amalihi. 
Conclusion: 
If your work involves continually looking at and mixing with women, we advise you to leave this job and look for another, or to move to another department in the same company where there are no women. 
If your work does not involve continually looking at and mixing with women, rather it only happens sometimes in an area other than the place where you work, then there is nothing wrong with staying in the job, so long as you lower your gaze and do the parts of your job that involve contact with women in the shortest possible time, and keep away from the causes of fitnah as much as possible. 
We ask Allah to help us to avoid fitnah (temptation, both obvious and hidden.

27305,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/27305,Marrying a thirteen year old girl,"I'm a boy of 26, and i have come to know a very nice girl, belonging to a very good family. I wish to marry her and to propose to her parents for this purpose. But the problem is that the girl is still a child, and only 13 years old, which makes her 13 years my junior in age.

I wish to ask if its morally acceptable for me to think about her, be attracted to her and to propose for her in marriage. And do u think our relationship would be legitimate and socially and religiously acceptable with this age difference.

Also, if per chance it is acceptable, it raises a question that islam advocates soliciting a girl's opinion in marriage, but how can such a young girl make an intelligent decision for herself. In such case, what are the basis for islam's allowing such a marriage to take place.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Note that the following answer is purely based on the Islamic point of view in theory. One must be conscious and aware of laws in the land they reside in and not do that which would bring harm to them. The believer must be wise in making decisions.

    
    There is nothing wrong with your marrying this girl, even 
    though there is this difference in age between you. What matters is that she 
    should be religiously committed and of good character. These are what 
    matters when it comes to marriage, and are the factors that lead to harmony 
    and happiness in sha Allaah. 

    The validity of marriage to a minor girl is proven by the 
    words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And those of your women as have passed the age of monthly 
    courses, for them the ‘Iddah (prescribed period), if you have doubt (about 
    their periods), is three months; and for those who have no courses [(i.e. 
    they are still immature) their ‘Iddah (prescribed period) is three months 
    likewise, except in case of death]”

    [al-Talaaq 65:4] 

    So the ‘iddah for those who do not menstruate because they 
    are too young is three months, and ‘iddah has to do with divorce after 
    getting married, which indicates that the girls in question has been married 
    and divorced. 

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    married ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) when she was six years 
    old, and he consummated the marriage with her when she was nine, and at that 
    time he was over fifty. 

    Al-Bukhaari (3894) and Muslim (1422) narrated that ‘Aa’ishah 
    said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married 
    me when I was six years old and consummated the marriage with me when I was 
    nine. 

    A girl who is thirteen years old may have reached the age of 
    puberty, in which case her consent is essential according to the more 
    correct of the two scholarly opinions, because the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A previously-married woman should 
    not be married until she has been consulted, and a virgin should not be 
    married until her permission has been sought.” They said: “O Messenger of 
    Allaah, what is her permission?” He said: “If she remains silent.” Narrated 
    by al-Bukhaari, 5136; Muslim, 1419, from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him). See also question no.
    22760. 

    If she has not reached the age of puberty, then her father 
    has the sole right to arrange her marriage and does not have to ask her 
    permission. 

    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: With regard 
    to a virgin who is still a minor, there is no difference of opinion 
    concerning her (i.e., that her father may marry her off even if she 
    objects). Ibn al-Mundhir said: Every scholar from whom we learned was agreed 
    that it is permissible for a man to marry off his virgin daughter who is 
    still a minor, if he marries her to someone who is compatible, and it is 
    permissible for him to marry her off even if she objects and refuses.” 
    Al-Mughni, 9/398 

    But it was narrated from Imam Ahmad that whoever reaches the 
    age of nine years comes under the same ruling as a girl who has reached 
    puberty, so her permission must be sought. But if the father opts to be on 
    the safe side and ask her permission, that is better.  Al-Mughni, 
    8/398-405.

27328,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/27328,The book Ihya’ ‘Uloom al-Deen,Do you advise us to read the book Ihya’ ‘Uloom al-Deen by Shaykh Abu Haamid al-Ghazzaali?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] was asked about this book, and 
    he replied as follows: 

    “With regard to the books Qoot al-Quloob and the 
    similar book al-Ihya’, which speak of the actions of the heart such 
    as patience, gratitude, love, trust in Allaah, Tawheed (belief in Allah 
    alone) and so on, Abu Taalib [the author of Qoot al-Quloob] has more 
    knowledge of hadeeth, reports and the views of scholars who spoke of 
    spiritual matters among the Sufis and others than Abu Haamid al-Ghazzaali, 
    and his words are more correct, more precise and further removed from bid’ah 
    (innovation). But nevertheless Qoot al-Quloob includes da’eef (weak) 
    and mawdoo’ (fabricated) ahaadeeth, and many unacceptable things. With 
    regard to what is said in al-Ihya’ about things that may doom a 
    person to Hell, such as pride, self-admiration, showing off, malicious envy, 
    etc., most of it is taken from al-Haarith al-Muhaasibi in al-Ri’aayah; 
    some of it is acceptable and some of it is to be rejected, and some of it is 
    controversial. There is a great deal of good in al-Ihya’ but it also 
    contains some blameworthy material and some corrupt material such as the 
    words of the philosophers on Tawheed, Prophethood and the Resurrection. When 
    he deals with Sufi topics it is like one who has taken an enemy of the 
    Muslims and dressed him in Muslim garb. The leaders of Islam denounced Abu 
    Haamid for this feature of his books, and they said that he was made sick by
    al-Shifa’, meaning Shifa’ Ibn Seena, which is about 
    philosophy. [Shifa’ literally means “healing” in Arabic]. 

    Al-Ihya’ contains da’eef (weak) 
    ahaadeeth and reports, and even many mawdoo’ (fabricated) reports. 

    It contains many of the errors and myths of the Sufis. 

    Nevertheless it also contains some of the words of Sufi 
    shaykhs who correctly understand the actions of the heart in accordance with 
    the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and it speaks of acts of worship and etiquette in 
    accordance with the Qur’aan and Sunnah; such material outweighs the material 
    that is to be rejected. This is why people differed and disputed concerning 
    it.” (Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, vol 10, p. 551). 

    Hence our advice is that people should not read it, 
    especially since there other books in the same field which mean that there 
    is no need for it, such as Haadi al-Arwaah, al-Fawaa’id, 
    Zaad al-Ma’aad by Ibn al-Qayyim; al-‘Uboodiyyah and al-Eemaan 
    by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah; Lataa’if al-Ma’aarif, and 
    Risaalat al-Khushoo’ fi’l-Salaah, by Ibn Rajab. There is also a summary 
    of Ihya’ ‘Uloom al-Deen from which one may benefit, such as 
    Mukhtasar Manhaaj al-Qaasideen by Ibn Qudaamah. In the case of a student 
    (taalib al-‘ilm) who has a strong foundation of knowledge, there is 
    nothing wrong with him reading it if he is able to distinguish between what 
    is saheeh (sound) and what is da’eef (weak), what is true and what is false.

27329,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/27329,She has repented from an illicit relationship but she wants to contact him in order to get married to him,"I have recently started wearing hijjab al hamdilla and since then i have realized how dead iw as before hijjab.. This hijaab is a responsibility i have taken and i am trying my best to become a better muslim
Before hijjab i knew this boy and we liked each other .. i know relationships are haram .. but then i wasn't aware of right and wrong.. well.. hamdilla we never did zina.. i am now 3rd year university and he is 4th
he is mutdayin now too.. even if i dont talk to guys anymore.. i will always have feelings for him and i wish he would propose to me or at leat he would tell me something that will make me wait.. but that isnt possible
unless if i email him or try to contact him.. so.. my question is .. if i write him and emaling asking him if i should wait for him to propose or not.. will itbe haram? i want to marry him 3al sunat Allah wa rasooloh..
and i think maybe he thinks i don't like him anymore.. so please let me know if i should send an email or not.. he is a very muhtaram respectable man and he too doesnt talk to girls anymore.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
It is well known in the religion of Allaah that it is forbidden to follow in the footsteps of the Shaytaan, and that all the steps that may lead to falling into something haraam are forbidden, even if they are permitted in principle. This is what the scholars call “preventing the means (that lead to haraam).” 
The basic principle of sharee’ah is that when Allaah forbids a thing, He also forbids the ways and means that lead to it, so that it may indeed be forbidden. 
We are happy when we hear of or see someone who has come back to Allaah and to His religion after having lost their way, but at the same time we fear that the Shaytaan may make what they used to do when they were astray attractive to them, thus preventing them from following guidance and making them go astray again.  
Obviously this is what we fear for the sister who asked this question and for her former friend who has also repented. Hence we cannot condone her idea of getting back in touch with the one with whom she had a relationship before she was guided, even if that is on the basis of wanting to get married according to sharee’ah. 
For a non-mahram woman to be in touch with a person with whom it is not permissible for her to be in touch leads to evil consequences which are obvious to any wise person. Hence Allaah has forbidden establishing relationships and taking close female friends. We have already posted some of the fatwas of the scholars on this issue. See questions no. 23349, 20949and 10221. 
Secondly: 
With regard to the answer to your question, which may be summed up as: Is it permissible for a woman to propose marriage to a man or to tell him that she wants to marry him? The answer is that in sharee’ah the word khutbah (proposal) refers to the man asking the woman. See question no. 20069. 
If a woman wants to marry some man, there is nothing wrong with her sending someone whose religious commitment and honesty she trusts to offer her in marriage to him, as Khadeejah (may Allaah be pleased with her) did when she heard of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and saw his good attitude and trustworthiness, and wanted to marry him. So she sent one of her relatives to offer her to him in marriage, and he agreed to marry her. 
Based on this, we say to the sister who asked this question: If you want to marry this young man, and he has a good attitude and is religiously committed, then there is nothing wrong with suggesting marriage to him through a trustworthy relative of yours. 
You should avoid getting in touch with him or with any other non-mahram men, because of the fitnah (temptation) involved in that.
