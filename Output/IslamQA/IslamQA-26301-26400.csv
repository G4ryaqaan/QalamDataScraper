26301,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26301,Can a person who believes that Jesus is the son of God be a Muslim?,Can you be a muslim and still believe that Jesus is the son of God?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    One of the most important principles of belief in Allaah is 
    to declare that Allaah is above all attributes that imply shortcomings. One 
    of the attributes that imply shortcomings that the Muslim must reject is the 
    notion that Allaah has a son, because that implies need and that there is a 
    being who is like unto Him, and these are matters which Allaah is far above. 
    Allaah says in Soorat al-Ikhlaas, which describes an attribute of the Most 
    Merciful and is regarded as being equal in reward to reciting one-third of 
    the Qur’aan: 

    “Say (O Muhammad): He is Allaah, (the) One. 
    

    Allaah-us-Samad [Allaah — the Self-Sufficient Master, Whom 
    all creatures need, (He neither eats nor drinks)].

    He begets not, nor was He begotten.

    And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him”

    [al-Ikhlaas 112:1-4 – interpretation of the meaning]

    Because the Christians believe that ‘Eesa (Jesus) is the son 
    of God – exalted be Allaah far above what they say – many verses of the 
    Qur’aan deny this claim and refute it, as Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“And the Jews say: ‘Uzair 
    (Ezra) is the son of Allaah, and the Christians say: Messiah is the son of 
    Allaah. That is their saying with their mouths, resembling the saying of 
    those who disbelieved aforetime. Allaah’s Curse be on them, how they are 
    deluded away from the truth!”

    [al-Tawbah 9:30]

    “O people of the Scripture (Christians)! Do not exceed the 
    limits in your religion, nor say of Allaah aught but the truth. The Messiah 
    ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), was (no more than) a Messenger of 
    Allaah and His Word, (‘Be!’ — and he was) which He bestowed on Maryam (Mary) 
    and a spirit (Rooh) created by Him; so believe in Allaah and His Messengers. 
    Say not: ‘Three (trinity)!’ Cease! (it is) better for you. For Allaah is 
    (the only) One Ilaah (God), glory is to Him (Far Exalted is He) above having 
    a son. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the 
    earth. And Allaah is All-Sufficient as a Disposer of affairs”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:171]
“The Messiah [‘Eesa 
    (Jesus)], son of Maryam (Mary), was no more than a Messenger; many were the 
    Messengers that passed away before him. His mother [Maryam (Mary)] was a 
    Siddeeqah [i.e. she believed in the Words of Allaah and His Books]. They 
    both used to eat food (as any other human being, while Allaah does not eat). 
    Look how We make the Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, 
    revelations, etc.) clear to them; yet look how they are deluded away (from 
    the truth)”
[al-Maa’idah 5:75]

     “And the Jews say: ‘Uzair (Ezra) is the son of Allaah, and 
    the Christians say: Messiah is the son of Allaah. That is their saying with 
    their mouths, resembling the saying of those who disbelieved aforetime. 
    Allaah’s Curse be on them, how they are deluded away from the truth!”

    [al-Tawbah 9:30]

    Because this false belief existed among the Christians, it 
    was essential for those among them who entered Islam to give up these false 
    beliefs which contradict Islam, one of which is this belief. It was narrated 
    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Whoever bears witness that there is no god except Allaah alone, with no 
    partner or associate, and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger and that 
    ‘Eesa is His slave and Messenger, and His Word which He bestowed upon Maryam 
    and a spirit created by Him, and that Paradise is real and Hell is real, 
    Allaah will admit him to Paradise (and grant him a position therein) 
    according to his deeds.” (al-Bukhaari, 3435; Muslim, 28). Al-Qurtubi (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him) said: From this it may be understood what the 
    Christian must be taught to say when he becomes a Muslim. Fath al-Baari, 
    hadeeth no. 3435.

     Based on this, a person can only be regarded as a Muslim if 
    he disavows himself of this false belief, and believes that Allaah is above 
    all shortcomings. Whoever acknowledges the greatness of Allaah will find it 
    easy to give up his old beliefs that are not appropriate with regard to 
    Allaah. We ask Allaah to help us to venerate Him and appreciate how great He 
    is.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
26304,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26304,Is a Woman’s Voice `Awrah?,Is what is said about a woman’s voice being `Awrah correct?,The woman’s voice is not `Awrah in principle for women used to complain to the Prophet and ask him about Islamic matters. But it is not permissible for a woman to speak in a soft or alluring voice.,,"Praise be to Allah.The woman’s voice is not `Awrah in principle, for women used to complain to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and ask him about Islamic matters. They also did that with the Rightly-Guided caliphs (may Allah be pleased with them) and the rulers after them. They would also greet non-Mahram men with Salam and return greetings, and none of the Imams of Islam denounced them for that. 
But it is not permissible for a woman to speak in a soft or alluring voice , because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women. If you keep your duty (to Allah), then be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery) should be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner.” [Al-Ahzab 33:32]

26307,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26307,Copyright and the ruling on photocopying some parts of academic reference works,"Is it haraam to photocopy parts of academic reference works for study purposes, knowing that the high cost of these books is the reason for photocopying? If a person copies them in order to make money, is that haraam?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It seems to be the case that copyright belongs to the authors and to their heirs after they die, and that there is nothing wrong with photocopying or copying it out by hand for personal use, not with the intention of selling, so long as the owner of the copyright has not expressly stated that copying for personal use is not allowed. But if it is copied for the purpose of selling it and trading in it, this is not allowed. 
Shaykh Bakr ibn ‘Abd-Allaah Abu Zayd said: 
“These clauses which protect works from tampering or interference, and protect the value of the work and the efforts of its author, are things that are regarded as essential, based on the general principles of Islam. This is indicated clearly in the texts and basic principles of sharee’ah, which you can find explained in detail in Adaab al-Mu’allifeen and Kutub al-Istilaah.  
Fiqh al-Nawaazil, 2/65 
The Islamic Fiqh Council which was held to discuss moral rights issued the following statements: 
Firstly: trade names, company names, trademarks, writings and inventions are all the copyright of their owners or authors, which in modern practice have acquired monetary value. These rights are respected by sharee’ah and it is not permissible to transgress against them.  
Secondly: It is permissible to dispose of a trade name, company name or trademark, and to transfer any of them in return for financial compensation, provided that this is not for the purpose of deceit or fraud, given that this has become a financial right.  
Thirdly: the owner of these rights has the right to dispose of them and no one should transgress against them. 
The Scholars of the Standing Committee for Academic Research said: 
There is nothing wrong with recording and selling useful tapes, or copying and selling books, because that is helping to spread knowledge, unless their authors have said that this is not allowed, in which case it cannot be done without their permission.

26312,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26312,Ruling on building mosques over graves,"Some people say that there is nothing wrong with building mosques over graves, basing that on the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“(then) those who won their point said (most probably the disbelievers): ‘We verily, shall build a place of worship over them’” [al-Kahf 18:21] 
Is what they say correct? What is the answer to that?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Building mosques over the graves of Prophets and righteous people, or over places connected to their lives, is something which the perfect sharee’ah of Islam came to forbid and warn against, and curses those who do that, because it is one of the means that lead to shirk and exaggeration about the Prophets and the righteous. Reality confirms the soundness of the message brought by sharee’ah, and proves that it is from Allaah, and offers definitive proof that what the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) brought from Allaah and conveyed to the ummah is true. Everyone who looks at the state of the Muslim world and the shirk and exaggeration that have come about because of building mosques over tombs, venerating them, adorning them and appointing custodians for them, will realize that this is indeed a means that leads to shirk, and that one of the beauties of sharee’ah is that it forbids this and warns against it. 
Among the reports that were narrated concerning that was the hadeeth narrated by the two Shaykhs, al-Bukhaari (1330) and Muslim (529) – may Allaah have mercy on them both – from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) who said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘May Allaah curse the Jews and the Christians, for they have taken the graves of their Prophets as places of worship.’” ‘Aa’ishah said: “He was warning (the Muslims) against (doing) what they had done.”  And she said: “Had it not been for that, the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have been made prominent but he was afraid it might be taken (as a) place of worship.” 
In al-Saheehayn it is also narrated that Umm Salamah and Umm Habeebah (may Allaah be pleased with them) told the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about a church that they had seen in the land of Abyssinia, and the images that were in it. He (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When a righteous man died among them, they would build a place of worship over his grave and put those images in it. They are the most evil of mankind before Allaah.” (Al-Bukhaari, 427; Muslim, 528) 
In Saheeh Muslim (532) it is narrated that Jundub ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: ‘I stand acquitted before Allah that I took anyone of you as a close friend (khaleel), for Allah has taken me as His close friend, as He took Ibraaheem as His close friend. Had I taken any one of my ummah as a close friend, I would have taken Abu Bakr as a close friend. Those who came before you used to take the graves of their Prophets and righteous men as places of worship, but you must not take graves as places of worship; I forbid you to do that.’” 
There are many ahaadeeth on this subject. The leading scholars of the Muslims, the imams of all four madhhabs (schools of thought) and others, have stated that it is forbidden to build mosques over graves, and they have warned against that, following the Sunnah of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), sincerely advising his ummah and warning against falling into the same trap as those who came before us, the extremists among the Jews and Christians and their ilk among those of this ummah who have gone astray. 
Some people use the story of the People of the Cave to support their specious argument that this is allowed:  
“(then) those who won their point said (most probably the disbelievers): ‘We verily, shall build a place of worship over them’” [al-Kahf 18:21 – interpretation of the meaning]
The answer to that is: that Allaah has told us about the leaders and powerful people of that time, and that they said these words. That does not imply that He liked that or approved of them, rather He said that by way of blaming them and condemning their action. This is indicated by the fact that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to whom this verse was revealed and who was the most knowledgeable of people as to how it should be interpreted, forbade his ummah to build mosques over graves, warned them against doing so, and cursed and condemned those who did that. 
If that had been permissible, then the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would not have discouraged it in such emphatic terms, and gone to the extent of cursing those who did it, and said that they are the most evil of mankind before Allaah. This is sufficient to convince the seeker of truth. Even if we were to assume that building places of worship over graves was permitted to those who came before us, it is not permissible for us to follow their example in that, because our sharee’ah abrogates the laws that came before it, and our Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is the Final Messenger whose sharee’ah is complete and universal. He has forbidden us to build mosques over graves, so it is not permissible for us to go against him. We must follow him, adhering to that which he brought and abstaining from anything from the ancient laws that goes against that or any custom that appeals to the one who does it but goes against that. For there is nothing more perfect than the laws of Allaah and there is no guidance better than the guidance of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).
 Allaah is the One Whom we ask to help us and all the Muslims to adhere firmly to His religion and to follow the sharee’ah of His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in all that we say and do, both outwardly and inwardly, in all our affairs, until we meet Allaah, for He is the All-Hearing, Ever-Near. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon His slave and Messenger Muhammad and his family and companions, and those who follow his guidance, until the Day of Resurrection.

26318,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26318,A man wants to take a second wife – would the second wife be sinning?,"My cousin and I love one another; he came to propose marriage to me but my mother refused. So he married someone else and had two daughters, but three years later he came back and wants to marry me according to the law of Allaah and His Messenger, and he wants to divorce his wife because of the problems and difficulties between them that have nothing to do with me. I love him but I am afraid of doing wrong to his wife; I do not want to bear any sin if I marry him. May Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    There is nothing to stop you marrying him, whether he 
    divorces his wife or not. Your marriage to him would not be counted as 
    wrongdoing towards his first wife, because plural marriage is something that 
    is regarded as commendable according to sharee’ah for the one who is able to 
    treat his wives fairly. With regard to the problems between him and his 
    first wife, and his thinking of leaving her, you have nothing to do with 
    that, and you will not be sinning, so long as you do not ask him to divorce 
    her or encourage him to divorce her in any way. 

    But if he does not divorce her and he wants to marry you, 
    then he must treat you both fairly. If he fears that he will not be able to 
    treat you fairly then it is not permissible for him to engage in a plural 
    marriage, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “… then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, 
    or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with 
    them), then only one or (slaves) that your right hands possess”

26327,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26327,Completing the Quran in Ramadan,May we understand from the fact that Jibreel (peace be upon him) reviewed the entire Quran with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in Ramadan that it is preferable to complete the Quran (during the month)?,,,"Praise be to Allah.and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allah.
 What may be understood from that is that we should study the Quran, and that studying the Quran is useful and beneficial, because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) reviewed it with Jibreel in order to study it and benefit from it, for Jibreel was the one who brought it from Allah and was the “ambassador” between Allah and the Messengers, so undoubtedly Jibreel would be able to teach the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) how to recite the Quran and understand the meanings of its verses. So if a person studies the Quran with someone who can help him to understand it and recite it, this is what is required, just as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) studied with Jibreel. This does not mean that Jibreel is better than the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but Jibreel was the Messenger who came from Allah and conveyed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that which Allah commanded him to convey of the Quran, its wordings and meanings. So the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) benefited from Jibreel in these ways. But it does not mean that Jibreel is superior to him  (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), rather he is the best of mankind and superior to the angels (upon whom be peace). But this teaching brought a great deal of good to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and to the ummah, because it was the study of that which had been brought from Allah, so that he might benefit from that which had been brought from Allah.
 There is also another lesson to be learned, which is that studying it at night is better than during the day, because this reviewing took place at night, and it is known that at night the heart is more focused and can benefit more from studying than it can during the day. Another benefit is the fact that studying is prescribed and it is a righteous deed, even at times other than Ramadan, because it brings benefit to both parties; if there are more than two people, that is fine, because each one can benefit from his brother and encourage him to read. For a person may not bother to read if he is sitting alone, but if he has someone else there to study with him, or other companions, that will be more effective in encouraging him to read. There is also the great benefit that all of them will find of discussing things that they did not understand, etc… all of that brings a great deal of good.
It may also be understood from this that for the Imaam to recite the whole Quran to the congregation in Ramadan is a kind of this studying together, because in that way they may benefit from hearing the whole of the Quran. Hence Imaam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) used to like the one who led them in (Taraaweeh) prayers to complete the whole Quran (during the month). This is akin to the actions of the Salaf who loved to hear the whole Quran. But this should not make us hasten in reading Quran, rather we should feel humble and at ease when reading Quran; paying attention to that is more important than thinking of completing the Quran.",From Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him). 15/324
26330,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26330,Ruling on using Zamzam water to wash with after relieving oneself,Is it permissible to wash with Zamzam water after relieving oneself (istinja’)?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The saheeh ahaadeeth indicate that the water of Zamzam is 
    blessed. It was reported in Saheeh Muslim (2473) that the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said concerning Zamzam: “It 
    is blessed and it is food that nourishes.” A report narrated by Abu Dawood 
    [i.e., al-Tayaalisi] (1/364) with a jayyid isnaad adds: “and healing for 
    sickness.” This saheeh hadeeth points to the virtue of Zamzam water, stating 
    that it is food that nourishes and a healing for sickness, and that it is 
    blessed. The Sunnah is to drink from it as the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) did, and it is permissible to do wudoo’ and 
    istinjaa’ with it, and to do ghusl for janaabah (impurity following sexual 
    activity) if that is necessary. 

    It was reported that water sprang from between the fingers of 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then the 
    people took it and used it for their needs; they drank it, did wudoo’, 
    washed their clothes and washed after relieving themselves. All of that 
    happened. Zamzam water is not like the water that sprang from between the 
    fingers of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), for 
    there can be nothing superior to that, but both are blessed. So if the water 
    that sprang from between the fingers of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) could be used for wudoo’, ghusl, istinja’ 
    and washing clothes, then it is also permissible to use Zamzam water in 
    these ways. Whatever the case, it is pure and good water which it is 
    mustahabb to drink, and there is nothing wrong with using it for wudoo’, for 
    washing clothes and for washing after relieving oneself, if that is 
    necessary, as stated above. It was narrated that the Prophet (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The water of Zamzam is for the 
    purpose for which it is drunk.” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 3062 – there is 
    some weakness in its isnaad but it is supported by the saheeh hadeeth quoted 
    above). Praise be to Allaah.","From Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 10/27"

    It is not permissible for a Muslim who has entered ihraam for 
    Hajj or ‘Umrah or both to do anything that may spoil his ihraam, or 
    undermine out his actions. Kissing is haraam for the one who has entered 
    ihraam for Hajj, until he has exited ihraam completely, which is done by 
    stoning Jamarat al-‘Aqabah, shaving the head or cutting the hair, doing 
    Tawaaf al-Ifaadah and doing Sa’ee if one still has to do Sa’ee – because he 
    is still subject to the rulings of ihraam during which intimacy with women 
    is prohibited. But his Hajj is not invalidated because of his kissing his 
    wife and ejaculating after the first stage of exiting ihraam. He has to ask 
    Allaah’s forgiveness and not do such an action again. He can make up for 
    that by sacrificing a sheep which meets the conditions of udhiyah

    her give up her sin, then there is nothing wrong with it. 

    But if it is for some personal reasons, or for some 
    difference of opinion over some worldly matters, such as some family 
    problems, then it is not permissible to forsake her or cut off ties with 
    her. If you greet her with salaams, then you are no longer regarded as 
    having forsaken her. That does not necessarily mean that you have to spend a 
    lot of time with her or talk to her a lot, especially if such contact will 
    not serve any purpose for you or for her.

26336,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26336,Her period started after the time for prayer began – what is the ruling?,"If a woman’s period starts after the time for prayer begins, what is the ruling? Should she make that prayer up?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If the period starts after the time for prayer begins, e.g. 
    it starts half an hour after the time for Zuhr prayer begins, then after she 
    becomes pure (i.e., after her period ends) she should make up the prayer 
    whose time began when she was still pure, because Allaah says: 

    “Verily, As‑Salaah (the prayer) is enjoined on the 
    believers at fixed hours” [al-Nisa’ 4:103]

    But she should not make up the prayers from the time of her 
    period because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said, in a lengthy hadeeth: “Is it not the case that when she is 
    menstruating she does not pray or fast?” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 304; 
    Muslim, 80). 
The scholars are agreed 
    that a woman does not have to make up the prayers that she missed during her 
    period. 

    But if she becomes taahir (pure – i.e., her period ends) and 
    there is still enough time left to do one or more rak'ahs, then she should 
    pray the prayer during the time of which her period ended, because the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever 
    catches up with one rak’ah before the sun rises has caught up with Fajr 
    prayer, and whoever catches up with one rak’ah before the sun sets has 
    caught up with ‘Asr prayer.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 579; Muslim, 607). So 
    if she become pure at the time of ‘Asr and there is enough time left before sunset for her to pray one rak’ah, then she should pray ‘Asr. And Allaah knows best.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il Fadeelat al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him), 11/276"
26338,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26338,What is the evidence for dividing Tawhid into three categories?,My question has to do with the division of Tawhid into three categories. Is there any evidence for that?,,,"Praise be to Allah.This division is taken from study and analysis. When the scholars analyzed the texts of the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), this became clear to them. Some of them added a fourth category, which is Tahweed al-Mutaaba’ah (oneness of following). All of that is derived from study and analysis. 
Undoubtedly the one who ponders the meanings of the Quran will find that it contains verses which enjoin devoting worship sincerely to Allah alone. This is Tawhid al-Uloohiyyah (Oneness of the Divine Nature). And he will find verses which indicate that Allah is the Creator and the Provider, that He is in control of all things. This is Tawhid al-Ruboobiyyah (oneness of the Divine Lordship), which the mushrikoon affirmed, but that did not make them Muslims. He will also find other verses which indicate that Allah has the Most Beautiful Names and the Most Sublime Attributes, and that He has no equal or peer. This is Tawhid al-Asma’ wa’l-Sifaat (Oneness of the Divine Names and Attributes), which was denied by the innovators such as the Jahamiyyah, Mu’tazilah, anthropomorphists and those who followed in their footsteps. 
There are verses which indicate that it is obligatory to follow the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and to reject whatever goes against his laws. This is Tawhid al-Mutaaba’ah (Oneness of Following). This categorization is known from study and analysis of the relevant aayahs and the Sunnah. For example, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything)” [Al-Faatihah 1:5]
“O mankind! Worship your Lord (Allah), Who created you and those who were before you so that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)” [Al-Baqarah 2:21] 
“And your Ilaah (God) is One Ilaah (God — Allah), Laa Ilaaha illa Huwa (there is none who has the right to be worshipped but He), the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful”[Al-Baqarah 2:163]
“And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).
I seek not any provision from them (i.e. provision for themselves or for My creatures) nor do I ask that they should feed Me (i.e. feed themselves or My creatures).
Verily, Allah is the All-Provider, Owner of Power, the Most Strong” [Al-Dhaariyaat 51:56-58] 
“Indeed, your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days, and then He rose over (Istawa) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty). He brings the night as a cover over the day, seeking it rapidly, and (He created) the sun, the moon, the stars subjected to His Command. Surely, His is the creation and commandment. Blessed is Allah, the Lord of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists)!” [Al-A’raaf 7:54]
 
“There is nothing like Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer” [Al-Shoora 42:11]
“Say (O Muhammad): “He is Allah, (the) One.
 Allah-us-Samad [Allah — the Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, (He neither eats nor drinks)].
He begets not, nor was He begotten.
And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him” [Al-Ikhlaas 112:1-4]
“Say (O Muhammad to mankind): If you (really) love Allah, then follow me (i.e. accept Islamic Monotheism, follow the Quran and the Sunnah), Allah will love you and forgive you your sins” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:31]
“Say: “Obey Allah and obey the Messenger, but if you turn away, he (Messenger Muhammad) is only responsible for the duty placed on him (i.e. to convey Allah’s Message) and you for that placed on you. If you obey him, you shall be on the right guidance. The Messenger’s duty is only to convey (the message) in a clear way (i.e. to preach in a plain way)” [Al-Noor 24:54]
And there are many aayahs which point towards this categorization. 
In the ahadith: 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, according to the hadeeth of Mu’aadh whose authenticity is agreed upon (al-Bukhari, 2856; Muslim, 30): 
“It is the right of Allah upon His slaves that they should worship Him and not associate anything with Him.” 
And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever dies invoking anything other than Allah as a rival to Allah will enter Hell.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4497; Muslim, 92). 
And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Jibreel (peace be upon him), when he asked him about Islam: “It means to worship Allah and not associate anything with Him, to pray the prescribed prayers, to pay the obligatory zakaah…” (Agreed upon; al-Bukhari, 50; Muslim, 9). 
And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever obeys me obeys Allah, and whoever disobeys me disobeys Allah.” (Agreed upon; al-Bukhari, 2957; Muslim, 1835). 
And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “All of my ummah will enter Paradise except those who refuse.” It was said, “O Messenger of Allah, who are those who refuse?” He said, “Whoever obeys me will enter Paradise and whoever disobeys me has refused.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari in his Saheeh, 7280). 
And there are many similar ahadith. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “God is the One Who is worshipped and obeyed. God is the One Who is loved, and the One Who is loved is the One Who deserves to be worshipped. The reason why He deserves to be worshipped is because of His Attributes which imply that He is the Most Beloved to Whom the utmost submission is due.” 
And he said: “God is the One Who is loved and worshipped, Whom hearts love, to Whom they submit, before Whom they humble themselves, Whom they fear and hope, to Whom they turn at times of difficulty, calling upon Him with regard to their concerns, putting their trust in Him with regard to their interests, seeking refuge in Him, finding tranquility in the remembrance of Him and peace of mind in love for Him. That is only for Allah, therefore the phrase Laa ilaaha ill-Allah (there is no god except Allah) is the most truthful of speech. Those who believe this are the people of Allah and His party, and those who deny it are His enemies who are subject to His wrath and vengeance. If a person gets this right his entire situation will be good, and if he fails to achieve this then his knowledge and actions will inevitably be corrupt.” 
We ask Allah to help all the Muslims, rulers and ruled alike, to understand His religion, to adhere steadfastly to it, to be sincere towards Allah and His slaves and to beware of that which Allah has forbidden, for He is Able to do that.  May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad and all his family and companions.","See Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), 6/215"

If he takes off his leather slippers (khufoof) or socks after wiping over them that does not invalidate his wudu, according to the correct scholarly view, because when a person wipes over his socks, he has completed his wudu according to what is implied by the shar’i evidence. So if he takes them off, this wudu is still valid according to the shar’i evidence and cannot be broken except by something for which there is shar’i evidence. There is no evidence to indicate that taking off leather slippers or socks that have been wiped invalidates wudu. On this basis, then, his wudu remains valid. This was the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and a group of the scholars. But if he puts his socks back on after that and breaks his wudu, then he wants to wipe over them again, that is not allowed, because he has to put the socks on after doing wudu in which he washed his feet, according to what was stated by the scholars.

26344,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26344,How to take possession of lands that do not belong to anyone,"The tribes in the south of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia used to control the mountainous lands before the establishment of the municipalities that now control those lands according to the system of the state, and the tribes no longer have any control over them.

The question is: 

What is the ruling on taking possession of these lands by reviving them in the manner described in sharee’ah, despite the objections of some members of the tribe to those who tried that? They were formerly partners in those lands, especially before the state took them over, and some of them are able to revive those lands and some are not. Please note that revival of the land should have taken place before 1382 AH according to the system of the Ministry of Justice.Thank you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The correct view is that reviving the land entitles a person 
    to take possession of it at any time, because of the general meaning of the 
    words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): 
    “Whoever revives dead land, it is his.” Some of the scholars, such as the 
    Hanafis, stipulate that the permission of the ruler is essential. This is 
    what is known as allocation of land, which the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do, whereby he would give a piece 
    of a land to a person to make use of it. In this case, whoever revived some 
    land before 1382 AH, it is his, and whoever revived land with the permission 
    of the ruler after 1382 AH, it is his. With regard to those tribes, if they 
    had taken possession of the land by reviving it in the past, then they are 
    more entitled to it because of their previous ownership. But if they did not 
    revive it and it was simply part of their village, then they have the right 
    to prevent anybody else from reviving it if that serves the interests of 
    their village, so they leave it as vacant land for recreational purposes, or 
    leave it for future development. In that case if someone revives it, that 
    will adversely affect them, so they can ask the government to ban anybody 
    from reviving it, even if the people who want to revive it are from the same 
    tribe. This is in order to ward off harm.  But if it will cause no adverse 
    effects and the land is far away from the town, and no one will be affected 
    and the ruler has given permission, then it is permissible for others to 
    take possession of it, and they have no right to object. If they want to 
    have it for themselves, then they have to ask the state for that because 
    they have more right to it and they do not want people who are not of their 
    tribe to live near them. In that case the decision rests with the state.",Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Jibreen

    There is nothing wrong with that so long as the women to whom 
    you offer the perfume will not be going out to market-places after they 
    leave your house and will be going back to their own houses in their cars, 
    or their houses are close by and they will not be mixing with non-mahram men 
    after they leave. 
But if the situation is 
    not like that, then you should excuse yourself to them and tell them that it 
    is not permissible for a woman to go out wearing perfume among non-mahram

26348,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26348,Moulding one’s character in the way that Allaah loves based on the meanings of His names and attributes,I heard one of the khateebs giving a Friday khutbah and urging the people to adopt the attributes of Allaah and to mould their character after His. Is there a correct way to understand this? Is there a scholarly precedent for this statement?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The expression to which you refer is not appropriate, but 
    there is a correct interpretation for it, which is encouraging people to 
    mould their character based on the meanings implied by some of the 
    attributes and names of Allaah. That means looking at the attributes of 
    which it is appropriate for the created being (man) to adopt the meanings 
    implied, in contrast to the attributes which belong exclusively to Allaah, 
    such as His being the Creator, Provider, God, etc., for these are attributes 
    to which the created being can never aspire and it is not permissible to 
    claim such attributes. Rather what is meant by the attributes which Allaah 
    loves for His slaves is that they should develop the attitudes implied by 
    those attributes, such as knowledge, strength in adhering to the truth, 
    mercy, forbearance, kindness, generosity, tolerance, etc. For Allaah is 
    All-knowing and loves those who are knowledgeable; He is Strong and loves 
    the strong believer more than He loves the weak believer; He is Generous and 
    loves those who are generous; He is Merciful and loves those who show mercy; 
    He is Forgiving and loves those who forgive, etc. But the attributes of 
    Allaah are more perfect and greater than the attributes of the created being 
    (man), so there is no comparison between them, because there is nothing like 
    unto Him in His attributes and actions, just as there is nothing that can 
    compare to Him in His Essence. Rather it is sufficient for the created being 
    to have a share in these attributes in the manner that befits him, within 
    the limits set by sharee’ah. If he oversteps the limits with regard to 
    generosity then he will become a spendthrift; if he oversteps the limit with 
    regard to mercy then he will fail to carry out the punishments decreed by 
    sharee’ah; if he oversteps the limits with regard to forgiveness then he 
    will forgive in an inappropriate manner. These are just a few examples, from 
    which others may be deduced. The great scholar Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said words to this effect in his books ‘Uddat 
    al-Saabireen and al-Waabil al-Sayyib, the texts of which follow. 
    In ‘Uddat al-Saabireen (p. 310) he said: “Because He is al-Shakoor 
    (the Appreciative) in the truest sense, the most beloved of His creation to 
    Him are those who are characterized by the attribute of thankfulness, and 
    the most hated of His creation to Him are those in whom this attribute is 
    lacking, or who are characterized by the opposite. This applies to His Most 
    Beautiful Names: the most beloved of His creation to Him are those who have 
    the characteristic implied by that meaning, and the most hated of them to 
    Him are those who have the opposite characteristic. For this reason He hates 
    the kaafir, the wrongdoer, the hard-hearted, the miser, the coward, the 
    despicable and the depraved. He is Beautiful and loves beauty; He is 
    All-Knowing and loves those who have knowledge; He is Merciful and loves 
    those who show mercy; He is Beneficent and loves those who do good; He is 
    the Concealer and loves those who conceal (sins or faults); He is 
    All-Powerful and condemns incapacity – the stronger believer is more beloved 
    to Him than the weak believer. He is Forgiving and loves forgiveness; He is 
    One and loves odd-numbered things. Everything that He loves is implied by 
    His Names and Attributes, everything that He hates is the opposite of 
    that.” 

    And he said in al-Waabil al-Sayyib (p. 43): 
    “Generosity is one of the attributes of the Lord, for He gives and does not 
    take, He feeds but He is not fed. He is the most generous of those who are 
    generous, the kindest of those who are kind. The most beloved of His 
    creation to Him are those who bear the characteristics implied by His 
    attributes. For He is Kind and loves those among His slaves who are kind; He 
    is All-Knowing and loves those who have knowledge; He is All-Powerful and 
    loves those who are brave; He is Beautiful and loves beauty.” 

    I hope that what we have mentioned here will be sufficient. I ask Allaah to enable us all to understand His religion and to adhere to it properly, for He is All-Hearing, Ever-Responsive. Praise be to Allaah the Lord of the Worlds.","See: Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), 1/133"
