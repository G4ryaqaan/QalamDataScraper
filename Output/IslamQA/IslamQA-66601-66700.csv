66605,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66605,Should the muezzin break his fast first or give the adhaan?,When should the muezzin break his fast – before the adhaan or after?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The basic principle is that the person who is fasting should break his fast after the sun has set and night has begun, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your Sawm (fast) till the nightfall”
[al-Baqarah 2:187]
al-Tabari said: 
With regard to the words “then complete your Sawm (fast) till the nightfall”, Allaah defines the end of the fast as being when night comes, and He defines the time for breaking the fast, when eating, drinking and intercourse become permissible. And the fast begins when the day starts and the night disappears. This indicates that there is no fasting at night, and there is no breaking the fast by day during the days of fasting. End quote. 
Tafseer al-Tabari, 3/532. 
The Sunnah is to hasten to break the fast for those who are fasting. 
It was narrated from Sahl ibn Sa’d (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The people will continue to do well so long as they hasten to break the fast.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1856; Muslim, 1098. 
Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
It is Sunnah to hasten to break the fast and to delay sahoor. Hastening should only be done after ascertaining that the sun has indeed set. It is not permissible for anyone to break the fast when he is not sure whether the sun has set or not, because if an obligatory act becomes binding when there is certainty, then he cannot stop doing this deed except when there is certainty. End quote. 
Al-Tamheed, 21/97, 98. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
This shows that we are encouraged to hasten to break the fast after ascertaining that the sun has set. What this means is that the ummah will continue to be in good shape and they will be fine so long as they adhere to this Sunnah. End quote. 
Sharh Muslim, 7/208. 
With regard to the muezzin, if there are people who are waiting for his adhaan in order to break their fast, then he should hasten to give the adhaan so that he will not be a cause of the people delaying to break their fast, because that is contrary to the Sunnah. 
But if he breaks his fast with something simple (such as drinking water), that will not cause him to delay the adhaan, then there is nothing wrong with that. 
If no one is waiting to hear the adhaan of the muezzin, such as if he is giving the adhaan for himself (such as a man who is alone in the desert), or he is giving the adhaan for a group of people who are close at hand (such as a group of travellers), then there is nothing wrong with him breaking his fast before giving the adhaan, because his companions will break the fast with him even if he does not give the adhaan, so they are not waiting for his adhaan.

These guidelines are discussed in the answer to question no. 5693. 
With regard to internal exams by hand or using a speculum, this does not break the fast. In the answer to question no. 38023 there is a detailed discussion of the things that break the fast and things that do not. It says there: 
Among the things that do not break the fast are: 
Insertion of anything into the vagina such as pessaries, or a speculum, or the doctor’s fingers for the purpose of medical examination. 
Insertion of medical instruments or IUD into the womb.

66613,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66613,"Should he pray behind those who pray Witr with three rak’ahs and two tashahhuds and one salam, and they recite qunoot before bowing?","In the Islamic centre where I pray, they follow the Hanafi madhhab, and they pray witr with three rak’ahs, separated by a tashahhud in the second rak’ah, after which they do not say salam, rather they stand up for the third rak’ah, and after reciting al-Faatihah and another soorah, they say takbeer but they do not bow, rather they recite du’aa’ al-tahajjud silently, then they say takbeer and bow. Is this valid? If not, what should we do?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
What the imam and the worshippers did, praying Witr with three rak’ahs, two tashahhuds and one salam, and reciting qunoot before bowing, are issues concerning which there is a well-known scholarly difference of opinion between the Hanafis and the majority of scholars. There is something makrooh about praying Witr in this manner. Praying Witr with three rak’ahs may be done in two ways, both of which are Islamically acceptable. They are as follows: 
1 – Praying the three rak’ahs one after another, with one tashahhud and one tasleem.
2 – Praying two rak’ahs then saying the salam, then praying one rak’ah on its own. 
You will find a detailed discussion of both ways, along with the evidence for them, in the answer to question no. 46544. 
As for praying three rak’ahs with two tashahhuds and one salam, it is narrated that this is not allowed and at the very least it is makrooh. We have quoted the fatwas of scholars forbidding this in the answers to questions no. 72246 and 26844. 
With regard to reciting qunoot before bowing, there is evidence for this in the saheeh Sunnah. Those who say that qunoot should be recited after bowing also have evidence. There is no reason for denouncing, let alone disputing, let alone doing what is worse than that, namely refusing to pray behind that imam. 
The issue of qunoot in Witr has been discussed in the answer to question no. 14093. 
Secondly: 
There is nothing wrong with praying behind them, even if they pray in the manner that you have described, because what they are doing is following a mujtahid imam, so there is no justification for refusing to pray behind them or causing division amongst them, especially since you are living in a kaafir land and whatever troubles arise among you will reflect badly on Islam. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
The scholars differed concerning a situation where the imam does not do what the person praying behind him believes to be obligatory, such as not reciting the Basmalah when the person praying behind him believes that this is obligatory, or he has touched his private part without doing wudoo’ afterwards, when the person praying behind him believes wudoo’ to be obligatory in that case, or he prays wearing the skins of dead animals that have been tanned, when the person praying behind him thinks that tanning does not purify, or he has been treated by means of cupping and did not do wudoo’ afterwards, and the person praying behind him thinks that wudoo’ must be done after cupping. The definitively correct view is that the prayer of the one praying behind the imam is valid even if the imam follows the wrong view with regard to a disputed issue, because it is proven in al-Saheeh that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “They lead in you in prayer, and if they do right, it is for you and for them, and if they do wrong, it is for you and against them.” 
Similarly, if the worshipper follows an imam who does qunoot in Fajr or Witr, he should pray qunoot with him, whether that is before bowing or after, and if he does not do qunoot, he should not do qunoot with him. If the imam thinks that it is mustahabb to do a certain thing in prayer but the one who is praying behind him does not think that is the case and he (the imam) decides not to do it for the sake of harmony and unity, that is better. 
An example of that is Witr, concerning which there are three views among the scholars: 
1 – That it should be three rak’ahs one after another, like Maghrib, as was the view of some of the people of Iraq.
2 – That it should only be one rak’ah performed separately from whatever comes before, as was the view of some of the people of the Hijaz.
3 – That both are permissible, as is the apparent view of al-Shaafa’i, Ahmad and others. This is correct view, although they preferred that it should be done separately from whatever came before. 
If the imam thinks that it should be done separately, and the congregation thinks that Witr should be done like Maghrib, and he agrees to do that so as to create harmony, that is better, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to ‘Aa’ishah: “Were it not that your people have only recently left Jaahiliyyah behind, I would have razed the Ka’bah to the ground and rebuilt it with two doors, one through which the people might enter and one through which they might exit.” But he decided not to do that which was better, lest it put the people off.

66621,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66621,Does a wife have the right to refuse intimacy with her husband during Ramadaan for the purpose of worship?,What is the ruling on a wife who refuses intimacy with her husband during Ramadaan because she is preoccupied with worship and drawing close to Allaah?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The month of Ramadaan is an important occasion for worshippers to increase their worship and for sinners to give up their ways and reconcile themselves with their Lord by giving up their sin and doing more acts of worship and obedience, so that they may turn over a new leaf and start a new life. 
There are saheeh ahaadeeth which speak of the virtue of fasting, praying qiyaam and observing i’tikaaf. And in Ramadaan there is a night – Laylat al-Qadr – which Allah has made better than a thousand months. 
Based on this, the one who wants to spend the days of this month in worshipping his Lord cannot be denounced. People are psychologically prepared to read Qur’aan and obey the Most Merciful, whether they are men or women. 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever spends the nights of Ramadaan in prayer out of faith and in the hope of reward, his previous sins will be forgiven.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (37) and Muslim (760). 
Secondly: 
Women should understand that their husbands have great rights over them. It is not permissible for a woman to refuse her husband these rights, or to refuse them for the sake of naafil acts of worship. 
It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Abi Awfa (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, no woman can fulfil her duty towards Allah until she fulfils her duty towards her husband. If he asks her (for intimacy) even if she is on her camel saddle, she should not refuse.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah (1853); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 1938. 
What this means is that women are urged to obey their husbands, and that they should not refuse them even in this situation, so how about in other situations? 
Haashiyat al-Sindi ‘ala Ibn Maajah. 
Because of the importance of husbands’ rights, women are enjoined to ask their permission before doing some acts of worship which may conflict with their rights, such as the following: 
1 – Observing naafil fasts. 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No woman should fast when her husband is present except with his permission. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (4896) and Muslim (1026). 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This is to be understood as referring to voluntary and recommended fasts for which there is no specific time. It is understood as meaning that this is haraam, as our companions stated. The reason for that is that the husband has the right to intimacy with his wife on all days, and his right is to be implemented immediately, and cannot be deferred because of voluntary acts of worship or because of an obligatory deed that may be done at any time. End quote. 
Sharh Muslim, 7/115. 
2 – Going out to the mosque 
It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When the wife of any one of you asks for permission to go to the mosque, do not forbid her.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (4940) and Muslim (442). 
Thirdly: 
The husband has to fear Allah with regard to his wife, and not burden her with more than she can bear. Many men keep their womenfolk busy all day with cooking, and at night with making sweets, so the woman’s days and nights are wasted and she cannot make the most of her fasting days or her nights by doing acts of worship. One of the wife’s rights over her husband is that she should have a share of the worship of this month. So he should not prevent her from reading Qur’aan, or praying qiyaam. There should be understanding between them so that there will not be any conflict between his rights and her worship of her Lord. This, of course, has to do with naafil acts of worship; with regard to obligatory acts of worship, the husband has no right to stop his wife doing them. 
The way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with his wives was to encourage them to worship and obey Allah, especially in the last ten days of Ramadaan. 
It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “When the (last) ten nights began, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would tighten his waist-wrapper (i.e., strive hard in worship or refrain from intimacy with his wives), stay awake at night and wake his family.”
Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1920) and Muslim (1174). 
If both husband and wife understand their rights and duties, they will avoid difficulties and arguments in most cases. If they understand that such occasions will only recur a few times during their lives, this should make them keener to make the most of the days and nights of Ramadaan.
 We ask Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, to reconcile your hearts and to help you to obey Him and worship Him properly.

66652,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66652,"Is it permissible to pray Witr with nine rak’ahs, two tashahhuds and one salaam?","What is the ruling on praying Taraweeh in congregation in the mosque, with nine rak’ahs and a tashahhud after the eighth rak’ah, and another tashahhud after the ninth rak’ah, followed by the salaam? Some people say that this is bid’ah (an innovation).

 I hope that you can tell me the ruling with the evidence, supported by the comments of earlier and later scholars.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The best way of praying Taraweeh is to pray eleven rak'ahs, 
    as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do 
    during Ramadaan and at other times. He used to pray two by two, then pray 
    Witr with three. If a worshipper does more or less than eleven rak’ahs, 
    there is nothing wrong with that. We have explained that in the answer to 
    question no. 9036.

    As for the way of praying Witr that is asked about here, it 
    is one of the ways of praying Witr. It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may 
    Allaah be pleased with her) was asked about the Witr of the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and she said: “The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray nine 
    rak'ahs during which he would not sit except in the eighth rak’ah, when he 
    would remember Allaah and praise Him and call upon Him, then he would get up 
    without saying the salaam, then he would stand and pray the ninth rak’ah, 
    then he would sit and remember Allaah (dhikr) and praise Him and call upon 
    Him, then he would say a tasleem that we could hear.” Narrated by Muslim, 
    746. 

    Ibn al-Qayyim said, explaining the various ways in which the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed Witr: 

    The fifth way is nine rak’ahs in which he would pray eight of 
    them continuously, and did not sit at all except in the eighth, when he sat 
    and remembered Allaah and praised Him and called upon Him, then he got up 
    without saying the salaam, then he prayed the ninth rak’ah, then he sat and 
    recited the tashahhud and said the salaam, then he prayed two rak’ahs 
    sitting down after he said the salaam. End quote. 

    Zaad al-Ma’aad, 1/317 

    Some people think that these ahaadeeth contradict one 
    another, because it is proven in al-Saheehayn that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed at night two by two 
    (rak’ahs), but that is not the case, because this hadeeth was narrated 
    concerning qiyaam al-layl, but the way of praying that we have mentioned and 
    that is mentioned in the question was narrated concerning Witr prayer. 

    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, after 
    quoting the ahaadeeth about the ways in which the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed Witr: 

    All of these are saheeh ahaadeeth which do not contradict one 
    another. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “The night prayers are two by two,” which is a saheeh hadeeth. But at the 
    same time he prayed witr with nine or seven or five rak’ahs. All of his 
    Sunnahs are true and confirm one another. The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) answered the one who asked him about the 
    night prayers by saying that they are two by two, and he did not ask him 
    about Witr. As for seven or five or nine or one, this has to do with Witr 
    prayer. Witr refers to the one rak’ah that is offered separately from the 
    prayers that are offered before it, as well as the five, seven or nine are 
    joined to one another, just as Maghrib is the name for three rak’ahs that 
    are joined to one another. If the five or seven are separated with two 
    salaams like the eleven, then Witr is the name given to the rak’ah that is 
    performed separately, as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “The night prayers are two by two, and when one of you fears 
    that dawn is about to break, let him pray witr with one rak’ah, to make the 
    prayer that he has offered odd-numbered.” So the actions and words of the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) are in agreement, 
    and they confirm one another. End quote. 

    I’laam al-Muwaqqi’een, 2/424, 
    425 

    In the answer to question no.
    52875 
    we have explained that Witr prayer is part of the night prayer, but they 
    differ in the way that they are done. 

    Based on this, Taraweeh prayers cannot be offered as nine 
    rak'ahs joined together with two tashahhuds and one salaam, rather the 
    prayer that is offered in this manner is Witr.

I hope that you can reply to my question about the ruling on my listening to what he says.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Allah has prescribed fasting during the month of Ramadhan so that those who fast may attain taqwa (piety). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)” [2:183] 
If that colleague who eats the flesh of people (by gossiping) does not pay heed to this month then when will he pay heed, repent and fear Allah? 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does not give up false speech and acting upon it, Allah has no need of him giving up his food and drink.” [al-Bukhaari]
‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Fasting is not just (giving up) food and drink, rather it is giving up lying, falsehood and idle talk.” 
Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah al-Ansari (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “When you fast, then let your hearing, your sight and your tongue fast from lying and sin, stop abusing servants and be tranquil and dignified on the day when you fast. Do not let the day when you do not fast and the day when you fast be the same.” 
Those who backbite about people and “eat their flesh” should beware lest their fast be lost and lest all they get from it is hunger and thirst. 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There may be a fasting person who gets nothing more from his fast that hunger and thirst, and there may be a person who prays qiyam and all he gets from his qiyam is a sleepless night.” [Ahmad]. 
Some of the scholars are of the view that committing sins invalidates the fast. 
Hafsah bint Sireen (may Allah have mercy on her) said: “Fasting is a shield, so long as the one who fasts does not break it, and what breaks it is backbiting.” 
It was narrated that Ibrahim al-Nakha’i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: They used to say that lying breaks the fast of one who is fasting. 
This was also the view of some of the salaf (pious predecessors), which is that all sins break the fast, and whoever commits a sin when he is fasting has to make it up. This is the view of al-Imam al-Awza’i, and was the view favoured by Ibn Hazm al-Zahiri (may Allah have mercy on him). 
But the majority of scholars are of the view that committing sins reduces the reward for fasting, but it does not invalidate the fast, and this is the correct view. See the answer to question no.  50063. 
Secondly: 
Backbiting is a major sin. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Avoid much suspicion; indeed some suspicions are sins. And spy not, neither backbite one another. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? You would hate it (so hate backbiting). And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful”
[49:12] 
It was narrated that Anas ibn Malik said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When my Lord took me up into heaven, I passed by some people who had nails of copper with which they were scratching their faces and chests. I said: ‘Who are these, O Jibreel?’ He said: ‘These are the ones who used to eat the flesh of the people and impugn their honour.’” [Abu Dawood]
Thirdly: 
You have to denounce this colleague of yours and not approve of what he is doing. 
It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand (by taking action); if he cannot, then with his tongue (by speaking out); and if he cannot, then with his heart (by hating it and feeling it is wrong), and that is the weakest of faith.” 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
Note that the one who hears any backbiting about a Muslim should refute it and rebuke the one who says it. If he does not rebuke him in words he should rebuke him by his actions. If he cannot rebuke him by his actions or his words, then he should leave that gathering. If he hears any backbiting about his Shaykh (teacher) or anyone else who has a right over him or is one of the righteous and virtuous people, then he should pay even more attention to what we have said. 
In the book of al-Tirmidhi we narrated from Abu’l-Darda (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever protects the honour of his brother, Allah will protect his face from the Fire on the Day of Resurrection.” [Al-Tirmidhi] End quote. Al-Adhkaar. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
I am a young woman who hates backbiting and gossip. Sometimes I am with a group of people who talk about others and they start backbiting and gossiping. In my heart I hate and loathe this, but because I am very shy I cannot tell them not to do that, and there is no place I can go to get away from them. Allah knows that I wish that they would talk about something else. Is there any sin on me for sitting with them? What should I do? May Allah help you to do what is best for Islam and the Muslims. 
He replied: 
There is sin on you for that unless you denounce the evil. If they accept that from you, then praise be to Allah, otherwise you have to leave them and not sit with them, because Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And when you (Muhammad) see those who engage in a false conversation about Our Verses (of the Quran) by mocking at them, stay away from them till they turn to another topic. And if Shaytan (Satan) causes you to forget, then after the remembrance sit not you in the company of those people who are the Zalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers)” [6:68] 
“And it has already been revealed to you in the Book (this Quran) that when you hear the Verses of Allah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them”
[4:140] 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand (by taking action); if he cannot, then with his tongue (by speaking out); and if he cannot, then with his heart (by hating it and feeling it is wrong), and that is the weakest of faith.” [Muslim]. 
And there are many other verses and ahadeeth (prophetic narrations) which say the same thing. And Allah is the Source of strength. End quote. 
Majmoo’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz. 
So strive to remind your colleague of the ruling on backbiting, and explain to him the punishment of the one who does that. Perhaps he will give up what he is doing of sin. Remind him that backbiting during Ramadhan is more sinful, and the basic principle is that you should avoid sitting with him if he persists in not responding to the command of Allah. But seeing as you work with him and you cannot leave the place, then avoid listening to him and stop paying any attention to what he says. You can use the means of threatening to report him to his superiors at work, or threaten to tell the people about whom he is talking. Perhaps if he does not fear Allah he will fear people and will stop backbiting about them, and you will be relieved of having to listen to his annoying talk.
