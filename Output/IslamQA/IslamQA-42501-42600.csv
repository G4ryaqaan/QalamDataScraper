42505,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42505,Cursing Islam in a Moment of Intense Anger,A man cursed Islam in a moment of intense anger – what is the ruling on that? What are the conditions of repentance from this action? Is his marriage to his wife annulled as a result?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    
    The ruling on the one who curses Islam is that he is a kafir (disbeliever), 
    because cursing Islam or making fun of it constitutes apostasy from Islam 
    and disbelief in Allah and in His religion. Allah tells us of some people 
    who made fun of Islam and then said. “We were just joking and playing,” but 
    Allah tells us that this joking and playing is in fact mocking Allah, His 
    signs and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and that 
    they were committing kufr (disbelief) thereby. Allah says (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 

    
    “If you ask them (about this), they declare: ‘We were only talking idly and 
    joking.’ Say: ‘Was it at Allah, and His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, 
    lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger that you were mocking?

    
    Make no excuse; you disbelieved after you had believed.’” [9:65, 66] 

    
    Mocking the religion of Allah, or cursing the religion of Allah, or 
    insulting Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon 
    him), or making fun of them, is kufr that puts one beyond the pale of Islam. 
    However, there is room for repentance from this, because Allah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    
    “Say: O ‘Ibadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by 
    committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, 
    Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful.” 
    [39:53] 

    
    If a person repents from any kind of apostasy and his repentance is sincere 
    and meets all the conditions of repentance, then Allah will accept his 
    repentance. There are five conditions of repentance, which are as follows: 

    1 
    – Being sincere towards Allah in repentance, i.e., the motive for repentance 
    should not be a desire to show off, or fear of another person, or the hope 
    for some worldly gain to be made by repenting. If a person’s repentance is 
    sincerely for the sake of Allah alone, and the motive for it is fear of 
    Allah and fear of His punishment and hope for His reward, then it is 
    sincerely for Allah alone. 

    2 
    – He must regret what he has done of sin, by feeling remorse and sorrow for 
    what has happened in the past, and he should regard it as a serious matter 
    that he has to give up. 

    3 
    – He must give up the sin and stop persisting in it. If his sin was omission 
    of an obligatory duty, he must start doing it and make it up if he can. If 
    his sin was commission of a forbidden action he must give it up and keep 
    away from it. If his sin had to do with other people, then he must restore 
    their rights to them or ask for their pardon. 

    4 
    – He must resolve not to go back to it in the future, by having the 
    determination in his heart not to go back to the sin from which he has 
    repented. 

    5 
    – His repentance must come at the time when it will be accepted. If it comes 
    after that time it will not be accepted. The time of acceptance is general 
    and specific.  

    
    The general time is when the sun rises from the west; repentance that comes 
    after the sun rises from the west will not be accepted, because Allah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    
    “The day that some of the signs of your Lord do come, no good will it do to 
    a person to believe then, if he believed not before, nor earned good (by 
    performing deeds of righteousness) through his faith. Say: Wait you! We 
    (too) are waiting.” [6:158] 

    
    The specific time is when death is imminent. When death is imminent 
    repentance will be of no benefit, because Allah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    
    “And of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do evil deeds 
    until death faces one of them and he says: ‘Now I repent;’ nor of those who 
    die while they are disbelievers.” [4:18] 

    I 
    say: if a person repents from any sin – even if that is cursing Islam – then 
    his repentance will be accepted if he meets the conditions mentioned here. 

    
    But it should be noted that a word may be an act of kufr (disbelief) or 
    apostasy, but the one who says it may not become a kafir (disbeliever) 
    thereby, if there is a factor present which means that he cannot be judged 
    to be a kafir. Here we have a man who tells us that he cursed Islam whilst 
    in a state of anger. We say to him: If your anger was so intense that you 
    did not know what you were saying, and at that point you did not know if you 
    were in heaven or on earth, and you said words without thinking or knowing 
    what they were, then these words are not subject to any ruling, and you 
    cannot be judged to be an apostate, because these words were not spoken 
    intentionally. If a word is spoken unintentionally, Allah will not punish a 
    person for it. Allah says concerning vows (interpretation of the meaning): 

    
    “Allah will not punish you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He 
    will punish you for your deliberate oaths.” [5:89] 

    
    If this person who spoke words of kufr in a moment of intense anger did not 
    know what he was saying, then there is no ruling on his words, and he cannot 
    be judged to be an apostate in this case. As he is not judged to be an 
    apostate, his marriage to his wife is not annulled; rather she is still 
    married to him. 

    
    But if a person feels angry he should try to counteract this anger in the 
    ways prescribed by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) 
    when a man asked him, “O Messenger of Allah, advise me.” He said: “Do not 
    get angry,” and he repeated it several times, saying, “Do not get angry.” So 
    he must exercise self-control and seek refuge with Allah from the accursed 
    shaytan (devil). If he is standing, he should sit down; if he is sitting, he 
    should lie down. If his anger grows too intense, he should do wudhu 
    (ablution). All these things will take away his anger. How many people have 
    regretted acting upon their anger, but it was too late.

42507,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42507,Hajj is not obligatory for a person who does ‘Umrah during the months of Hajj,"Before the begining of the month of Haj, I did my umrah before the month of Haj, some one told me that Haj is wajeeb on me now , although I have already did haj 2 years back, please clarify the same?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    What this person told you is not correct, because Hajj is 
    only obligatory once in a lifetime, because of the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas, 
    which says that al-Aqra’ ibn Haabis asked the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him): “O Messenger of Allaah, is Hajj (to be 
    done) every year or only once?” He said: “One once, and whoever does more 
    than that, it is a voluntary (act of worship).” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 
    1721; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. 

    Since you did Hajj before that, then you do not have to do 
    Hajj again. 

    There are three months of Hajj: Shawwaal, Dhu’l-Qi’dah and 
    Dhu’l-Hijjah. Perhaps this person understood from the fact that they are 
    called the months of Hajj that whoever does ‘Umrah during these months is 
    obliged to do Hajj. But this is incorrect, rather the reason why they are 
    called the months of Hajj is that Hajj must happen during these months, not 
    before or after them. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was 
    asked about a man who did Hajj tamattu’, then after doing ‘Umrah he went 
    back to his city and did not do Hajj – does he have to do anything (offer 
    any expiation or ransom)? 

    He replied: You do not have to do anything, because if a 
    person is doing Hajj tamattu’ and enters ihraam for ‘umrah, then decides not 
    to do Hajj before he enters ihraam for Hajj, then he does not have to offer 
    any expiation or ransom, unless he vowed to do Hajj this year. If he made 
    such a vow then he is obliged to fulfil his vow.

The issue is stolen phone time. There are a lot of Arab students in this country and each one of them has to make overseas calls. Because the cost of making overseas calls is very high, they have all started to go to places where using the telephones is much cheaper than usual. The reason for that is that these phones are connected to phones belonging to individuals living in this country or they belong to the government. Many people justify this by saying that the government is not Muslim and is hostile towards Islam and Muslims, so we are entitled, indeed obliged, to corrupt their economy. So they regard this as permissible if the phones belong to the government.",,,"Praise be to Allah.

      promise, otherwise they would not have allowed you to enter.  The Muslim

      he defends falsehood knowingly, relying in his defence on man-made laws,

    In every case in which he defends falsehood knowingly,

      It is not permissible for a husband to take anything of his 
      wife’s wealth unless she gives it willingly; that includes her mahr, 
      except in a case where the wife has committed a blatant immoral action. 
      Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part 
    of it to you, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:4]

    may take away part of the Mahr you have given them, unless they commit open 
    illegal sexual intercourse”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:19]

    Ibn Qudaamah said: 

    The scholars are agreed that the husband may not take her 
    wealth, except in the case of willful defiance and bad conduct on her part. 
    Ibn al-Mundhir narrated that al-Nu’maan said: If the wrongdoing and 
    mistreatment is on his the husband’s part and she seeks divorce by means of 
    khula’, then it is permissible for him (to take the mahr), but he is sinning

    be upon him), and the consensus of the scholars. 

    Al-Mughni, 3/137 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa 
    (32/283): 

    It is not permissible for a man to treat his wife harshly in 
    order to make her give up part of the dowry, or to beat her for that 
    purpose. But if she commits an blatant act of immorality then he has the 
    right to treat her harshly in order to make her give up her mahr or some of 
    it (so he can divorce her), and he may hit her. This is between the man and 
    Allaah. The woman’s family should investigate the matter and fid out who is 
    in the right. If it is proven to them that she is the one who transgressed 
    the sacred limits of Allaah and betrayed the husband, then she is a 
    wrongdoer and transgressor, so she should give back the mahr (or part of 
    it). End quote. 

    What is meant by the act of blatant immorality (or “open 
    illegal sexual intercourse”) mentioned in the verse (interpretation of the 
    meaning):   

    “and you should not treat them with harshness, that you 
    may take away part of the Mahr you have given them, unless they commit open 
    illegal sexual intercourse”

42534,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42534,Jihad against the hypocrites,"The hypocrites still raise their ugly heads from time to time, whenever they get the opportunity, in order to attack the basic and fundamental beliefs and practices of the ummah, or to cast doubts on its basic tenets, or to strip the community of its Islamic identity. What should we do about them, and how can we protect the ummah against their evil?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Undoubtedly this is a problem from which the ummah suffers 
      from time to time, especially when it is faced with trials and 
      tribulations and these hypocrites feel secure and feel that they will not 
      be punished if they attack the foundations of this religion and try to 
      spread division and tribulation. 

    Undoubtedly the damage that these people do is greater than 
    that caused by the kuffaar whose kufr is obvious, as Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “They are the enemies, so beware of them. May Allaah curse 
    them! How are they denying (or deviating from) the Right Path?”

    [al-Munaafiqoon 63:4]
Because of that, it is 
    prescribed to wage jihad against them and to treat them harshly. 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said concerning the Nusayris, among whom were some who expressed their kufr 
    and heresy openly and others who made a hypocritical show of loving Ahl 
    al-Bayt (the members of the Prophet’s household): 

    Undoubtedly waging jihad against these people and carrying 
    out the hadd punishments against them is one of the greatest acts of 
    obedience and most important obligatory actions. It is better than waging 
    jihad against those mushrikeen and people of the Book who do not fight the 
    Muslims, for waging jihad against these comes under the same heading as 
    waging jihad against the apostates. Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq and all the Sahaabah 
    started with jihad against the apostates before they engaged in jihad 
    against the kuffaar of the people of the Book, for jihad against these (the 
    apostates) is a means to protect the lands that are already under Muslim 
    rule, and to deter anyone who wants to apostatize. Jihad against the 
    mushrikeen and people of the Book who are not fighting us is an additional 
    manifestation of the power of this religion. Protecting the capital takes 
    precedence over making profit. 

    Moreover the harm that these people (hypocrites) cause to the 
    Muslims is greater than that caused by others (kaafirs), indeed their harm 
    is like that caused by the mushrikeen and people of the Book who fight the 
    Muslims. The damage that they do to the religious commitment of many people 
    is worse than the damage done by those mushrikeen and people of the Book who 
    wage war on us. Every Muslim must do as much as he can of his duty. It is 
    not permissible for anyone to keep quiet about anything that he knows about 
    them, rather he must broadcast it so that the Muslims will know what they 
    really are. It is not permissible for anyone to help them to remain among 
    the troops and government employees, or for anyone to keep quiet and refrain 
    from carrying out against them that which Allaah and His Messenger have 
    enjoined. It is not permissible for anyone to speak against carrying out 
    what Allaah and His Messenger have enjoined. This is one of the greatest 
    types of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and of striving 
    in jihad for the sake of Allaah. Allaah said to His Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O Prophet (Muhammad)! 
    Strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be harsh 
    against them”

    [al-Tawbah 9:73]

    These people are included in this phrase “the disbelievers 
    and the hypocrites”. 
The one who helps to put 
    a stop to their evil and to guide them as much as he can will have of reward 
    that which is known only to Allaah, for the primary purpose is to guide them 
    as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“You (true believers in 
    Islamic Monotheism, and real followers of Prophet Muhammad and his Sunnah) 
    are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind”
    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:110] 

    Abu Hurayrah said: You are the best of people for people, you 
    bring them in chains and fetters until they enter Islam. (al-Bukhaari, 
    4557). 
The purpose of jihad and 
    of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, is to guide people to 
    what is best for them in this world and in the Hereafter, as much as 
    possible; then whomsoever Allaah guides will find happiness in this world 
    and in the Hereafter, and whomsoever He does not guide, his evil will be 
    contained. 

    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 35/159-160 

    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said: 

    The Muslim ummah must respond in kind when it is attacked. So 
    with regard to those who fight Islam with ideas and words, we must explain 
    the falseness of what they say using rational evidence as well as shar’i 
    evidence, so that the falseness of what they say will become apparent. 

    With regard to those who fight Islam by economic means, we 
    must ward them off and attack them if possible, by using the same means with 
    which they attack Islam. We must explain that the best way to strengthen the 
    economy in a just manner is the Islamic way. 

    With regard to those who attack Islam with weapons, we must 
    resist them in a similar fashion. Hence Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “O Prophet (Muhammad)! Strive hard against the 
    disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be harsh against them, their abode is 
    Hell, — and worst indeed is that destination”

    [al-Tawbah 9:73]
It is well known that 
    jihad against the hypocrites is not like jihad against the kuffaar, because 
    jihad against the hypocrites is fought with knowledge and argument, whilst 
    jihad against the kuffaar is fought with swords and arrows.

The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked about buying Islamic books with zakah wealth and distributing them. They replied: It is not permissible to buy books with zakah wealth and give them away, rather the wealth itself should be given to those who are entitled to it, as mentioned by Allah in His Book where He said (interpretation of the meaning):

If a person who is entitled to zakah is a sinner and there is the fear that he may use some of this money for sinful purposes, then we should give the zakah to one who spends on him, or to someone whom we trust will buy him what he needs. 
Shaykh Muhammad al-Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
If a person who is addicted to smoking is poor, then we can give the zakah to his wife and she can buy things herself that are needed for the house, and we can tell him: We have zakah, do you want us to buy you such and such of essential needs? We can ask him to delegate us to buy these things, and in this way we will achieve the desired goal and avoid something haraam – which is helping him to commit sin, because the one who gives a dirham to a person to buy cigarettes with has helped him to commit sin and has done something that Allah has forbidden, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“do not help one another in sin and transgression”[al-Maa’idah 5:2]
Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (17/question no. 262) 
He was also asked: Is it permissible to give zakah in the form of consumable goods and clothing, if it is known that in the case of some poor families it is better to buy these things for them, because there is the fear that if they are given cash, they will spend it on things in which there is no benefit? 
He replied: 
This is an important matter which people need to know: if the people of this household are poor, and if we give them money they will waste it by buying luxuries and things that are of no benefit, so is it permissible for us to buy them essential needs and give them to them? 
What is known to the scholars is that it is not permissible to do this, i.e., it is not permissible for a person to buy specific things with his zakah and give them instead of money. They said: That is because money is more beneficial to the poor, because he can spend the money however he wants, unlike specific goods of which he may have no need, in which case he will sell them for less. 
But there is a way around this if you fear that if you give money to this family, they will spend it on things they do not need. You can say to the head of the household – whether that is the father, the mother, the brother or the uncle: I have zakah, what are the things you need, so that I can buy them for you and send them to you? If you do it in this way, that is permissible, and the zakah will be given as it should be.

42551,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42551,"Her husband does not do any of his duties, he sleeps a lot and he neglect prayers","My husband of eight years is a non practising muslim. He lost his job in Nov. 2002 during Ramadan and has been out of work since. He has not once prayed to Allah to ask for help with a job. Instead, he wakes up at 3, 4, 5 in the afternoon. He has even woken up at 8 or 9 o'clock in the evening. he then plays on the computer ALL night and goes to bed at 6 or 7 in the morning, when I am getting up for fajr namaz. We have 3 children whom he hardly sees because they are usually going to bed as he is getting up. If i try to wake him in the mornings to take the children to school, or on a Friday for Jumaah namaz, he will shout or swear or hit me. I have to look after the children myself, go and do all the shopping even for meat. I don't like to go to the meat shop because only men are there.but if I don't go he thratens to kick me out of the home. I am also at college so it is very hard for me to do everything myself. I always pray to Allah for his guidance and help but I am only human and the situation is getting more difficult. I cannot cope with things as they are. I am not exagerrating when I tell you he is on the computer every night and not looking for a job. Since November he has been shopping only 2 times, taken the children to school maybe 10 times. He does'nt leave the house to visit family, and nobody comes to visit anymore. Our money is getting less and he tells me to leave the house if I don't like things. I cannot bear to look or speak to him, but still I pray to Allah that our situation is improved, and that Allah may choose to open my husbands eyes and heart. His parents have spoken to him, but he doesn't listen, and now his mother is always blaming me. I didn't loose him his job, neither do I complain about him not finding another one. I am not a wife who asks for alot of money to buy gold and jewellery and fancy clothes, but I do want good things for my children and food at home, this is why I go to college so insh'allah i can find a suitable job. But my husband won't stop this addiction of the computer, he doesn't stop shouting at the children every day if they become noisy while they are playing and he is sleeping during the day. What can I do?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    We ask Allaah to help you and give you strength, and to guide 
    your husband aright. 

    Undoubtedly by taking care of your children and being keen to 
    guide your husband, you are doing good and will be rewarded in sha Allaah, 
    for Allaah does not cause the reward of those who do good to be lost. 

    Our advice to you is to keep on being patient and making 
    du’aa’ for your husband, and striving to guide him, through his parents, his 
    brothers and those who have any influence on him. If a man neglects his duty 
    towards his family he exposes himself to the wrath and anger of Allaah, 
    because he is neglecting that which Allaah has entrusted to his care. The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Each of you 
    is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock. The ruler is the 
    shepherd of his people and is responsible for his flock. A man is the 
    shepherd of his family and is responsible for his flock….” This hadeeth was 
    narrated by al-Bukhaari, 893; Muslim, 1826, from Ibn ‘Umar. And the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said of his household: 
    “Allaah will ask every shepherd about that which was entrusted to his care, 
    whether he took care of it or neglected it, and He will even ask a man about 
    his family.” Narrated by Ibn Hibbaan, classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in 
    Ghaayat al-Maraam, no. 271 

    And he said: “It is sufficient sin for a man to neglect those 
    who are under his care.” Narrated by Ahmad and Abu Dawood from the hadeeth 
    of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh 
    al-Jaami’, no. 827. 
And he said: “There is no 
    man whom Allaah causes to be appointed to a position of responsibility and 
    he does not discharge his duties sincerely, but he will not even smell the 
    fragrance of Paradise.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6731. 

    We do not think that your husband would like to have this 
    warning directed at him, or that he would want his wife to spend on him and 
    take care of him. This is something that men instinctively dislike. 

    You said that he sleeps and misses the prayers because he 
    stays up at night and wastes his time. This means that he is in grave danger 
    from another angle. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given 
    up As‑Salah (the prayers) [i.e. made their Salah (prayers) to be lost, 
    either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not 
    offering them in their proper fixed times] and have followed lusts. So they 
    will be thrown in Hell”

    [Maryam 19:59]
Ibn Mas’ood said that 
    al-Ghayy (translated here as “Hell”) is a valley in Hell that is very deep 
    and has an awful taste. 

    And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “. So woe unto those performers of Salaah (prayers),

    5. Those who delay their Salaah (prayer from their stated 
    fixed times)”

    [al-Maa’oon 107:4-5]

    This refers to those who delay their prayers from the proper 
    times. But if he does not pray at all, then this is kufr which puts him 
    beyond the pale of Islam, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Between a man and shirk and kufr there stands his 
    giving up prayer.” Narrated by Muslim, 82. 

    And he said: “The covenant that stands between us and them is 
    prayer. Whoever gives it up is a kaafir.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2621; 
    al-Nasaa’i, 463; Ibn Maajah, 1079; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. 

    In that case you have to advise him, and if he persists in 
    not praying, then you have to prevent him from being intimate with you until 
    he repents and starts to pray.

     We ask Allaah to set the affairs of all the Muslims traight.

42564,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42564,Ruling on selling haram clothes to the kuffaar,"I am a dealer in stock lot of garments which are being exported to U.S.A. and other European countries.I live in Sri Lanka where majority are non-muslims, and I supply these clothes to retail outlets and I also come across women's clothes such as short skirts, shorts, tight fitting pants, blouses which are forbidden in Islam.Please let me know whether my income is halal if I buy and sell these kind of garments.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allah has commanded the believers to cooperate amongst themselves in righteousness and piety, and He has forbidden them to cooperate in sin and transgression. He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression” [al-Maa’idah 5:2]
According to the shar’i principle set out by the scholars: “The means are subject to the same ruling as the ends.” So everything that leads to haram is also haram. 
Selling haram clothing such as short skirts and tight pants etc in which women go out is undoubtedly haram because it leads to forbidden wanton display of their charms, by means of which women tempt men. 
Those who buy these clothes usually go out and appear in them in front of people, so selling them is helping in sin and transgression, and spreading immorality and evil among the people. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:  
All clothes which one thinks most likely will be used for sinful purposes, it is not permissible to sell them or sew them for one who will use them for sinful and wrongful purposes. 
Sharh al-‘Umdah, 4/386. 
Even if the clothes are being exported and sold to kaafir women, it makes no difference to the ruling, because the minor rulings of sharee’ah are also addressed to the kaafirs, according to the correct scholarly view. This is the view of the majority of scholars. So everything that is obligatory for Muslims is also obligatory for kaafirs, and everything that is forbidden to Muslims is also forbidden to kaafirs. They will be brought to account for that on the Day of Resurrection, and their torment will be increased. 
The evidence for that is the verse in which Allah says of the people of Hell (interpretation of the meaning):
“’What has caused you to enter Hell?’
43. They will say: ‘We were not of those who used to offer the Salaah (prayers),
44. Nor we used to feed Al‑Miskeen (the poor);
45. And we used to talk falsehood (all that which Allah hated) with vain talkers.
46. And we used to belie the Day of Recompense’”
[al-Muddaththir 74:42-46]
The point here is that Allah tells us that He will punish them on the Day of Resurrection, and that their punishment will be Hell, and that when they are asked why they deserve this punishment, they will say that it is for the sins of not praying and not feeding the poor. This indicates that they will be punished for that as well as for their being kuffaar who did not believe in the Day of Reckoning. 
In conclusion: 
Selling these garments to those who you think will most likely use them for sinful purposes is haram, whether those who buy them are Muslims or kaafirs. 
And Allah knows best. 
See also the answer to question no. 34674. In the answer to question no. 3011 you will find an important discussion of a hadeeth from which it may be understood that it is permissible to sell things that are forbidden to Muslims if they are being sold to kaafirs.

Investing pension money


Participating in government pension plan","Praise be to Allah.Are pensions halal?
Participating in pension plans other than those organized by the government is a kind of gambling, because a person may contribute to the scheme for a number of months, then become disabled or die, so he and his heirs may get much more money than was taken from them, or he may pay many installments then what he takes from them is less than what he paid. This is gambling . For more details, please see this answer: 8889 .  
Investing pension money
If they are investing the money deducted in haram things such as making alcohol, or in riba-based loans, this is another reason to regard this as haram, because that is helping them in sin and transgression. 
This applies if your participation in this scheme is voluntary. It is not permissible to participate in it in this case, and whoever gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with something better than that. 
But if participation is compulsory, then there is no sin on you, but it is not permissible for you or your heirs to take more than what was taken from you. You can leave the rest, or take it and donate it to charitable causes. 
Participating in government pension plan
With regard to participating in the government pension plan , this may not come under the same ruling, in the sense that the government or treasury (bayt al-mal) is responsible for spending on the people if they need that.

42573,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42573,What Does Islam Say About Redemption?,Why do Muslims persist in denying that the Messiah came to redeem us?,"Muslims believe that Jesus did not die on the cross and therefore there is no sacrifice, no salvation, and no trinity. Muslims do not believe in the original sin; rather they believe that no one can bear the sin of anyone else, or redeem him with his own self. Allah promises those who repent that their repentance will be accepted. The Messiah affirmed the importance of righteous deeds. He did not tell them of redemption by which they would be saved from the reckoning.","Meaning of redemption


Does redemption mean saving all of mankind?


Was this salvation from the “original sin” of Adam only?


Is there an original sin?


Will God accept our repentance?


Jesus affirmed the importance of righteous deeds","Praise be to Allah.Meaning of redemption
The doctrine of redemption, and the basis of this doctrine which is their belief that the Messiah (peace be upon him) was crucified, is one of the basic doctrines of Christianity , so much so that they would gamble the entire religion on this doctrine. 
The English cardinal Manning says in his book “Eternal Priesthood”: “The importance of this confusing topic is obvious, for if the death of Christ on the cross is not real, then the basis of the church’s doctrine will crumble from its foundations, because if Christ did not die on the cross, then there is no sacrifice, no salvation , and no trinity … Paul, the Apostles and all the churches say that, i.e., if Christ did not die then there was no resurrection either.” 
This is what Paul said: 
“And if Christ has not been raised, then preaching is useless and so is your faith.” I Corinthians 15:14 – New International Version (NIV)
Just as they struggle with their belief in trinity and what it means, and how they can reconcile it with the belief in monotheism which is affirmed in the Old Testament (See the question: 12628 ), and just as they also struggle with everything that has to do with the crucifixion and its details, which is the basis of their belief in redemption which they believe is the reason for the crucifixion , we say: as confusion is inevitable for everyone who turns away from the light of revelation that came down from Allah, similarly they are confused about the doctrine of redemption. 
Does redemption mean saving all of mankind?
Does redemption mean saving all of mankind, as John says: 
“…Jesus Christ, the Righteous One.
He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world” I John 2:1-2 (NIV) 
Or is it only for those who believe and are baptized: 
“Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned” Mark 16:16 (NIV)
The one who studies the life and sayings of the Messiah will see clearly that the call of the Messiah was addressed to the Children of Israel, and that throughout his mission he forbade his disciples to call anyone else. So salvation must have been only for them. This is what we see in the story of the Canaanite woman who said to him: 
“… ‘Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is suffering terribly from demon-possession.’
Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, ‘Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.’
He answered, ‘I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.’
The woman came and knelt before him. ‘Lord, help me!’ she said.
He replied, ‘It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs.’”
Matthew 15:22-26 – NIV
The Messiah did not heal the daughter of the Canaanite woman, although he was able to do so, so how could he redeem all of mankind? 
Was this salvation from the “original sin” of Adam only?
Was this salvation from the “original sin” of Adam only, or does it include all of our sins? 
But no one can bear the sin of anyone else, or redeem him with his own self, as Allah tells us in His Noble Book (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And no bearer of burdens shall bear another’s burden; and if one heavily laden calls another to (bear) his load, nothing of it will be lifted even though he be near of kin. You (O Muhammad) can warn only those who fear their Lord unseen and perform As-Salah (Iqamat-as-Salah). And he who purifies himself (from all kinds of sins), then he purifies only for the benefit of his own self. And to Allah is the (final) Return (of all).” [Fatir 35:18]
This is what the texts of their Bible also say: 
“The soul who sins is the one who will die. The son will not share the guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him.” Ezekiel 18:20-21-- NIV
Is there an original sin?
There is no inherited sin (“original sin”): 
“If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. Now, however, they have no excuse for their sin.
He who hates me hates my Father as well.
If I had not done among them what no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. But now they have seen these miracles, and yet they have hated both me and my Father” John 15:22-24 – NIV
When there is sin – whether a person has committed it himself or inherited it from Adam or from another of his forefathers – can this sin not be erased through repentance? 
The people of heaven rejoice over the one who repents like the shepherd rejoices when he finds his lost sheep, and the woman rejoices over her lost penny when she finds it, and a father rejoices over his prodigal son when he returns: 
“I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.” (Luke 15:7)
Will God accept our repentance?
God promises those who repent that their repentance will be accepted : 
“But if a wicked man turns away from all the sins he has committed and keeps all my decrees and does what is just and right, he will surely live; he will not die.
None of the offenses he has committed will be remembered against him. Because of the righteous things he has done, he will live.” Ezekiel 18:21-23 – NIV. See also Isaiah 55:7
Putting one's trust in one’s lineage without repenting or doing righteous deeds is a kind of madness; if a person’s deeds slow him down, his lineage will not help him to speed up, as our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said. (Sahih Muslim, 2699) 
John the Baptist (Yahya – peace be upon him) taught you the same things: 
“You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.
And do not think you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire” Matthew 3:7-10 – NIV
Forgiveness of sins through the sinner’s repentance is what befits the kind and merciful God – not sacrifice and crucifixion and the shedding of blood. This is what the Bible says: 
“I desire mercy, not sacrifice. For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners (to repentance)” Matthew 9:13 – NIV
(the words “to repentance” do not appear in the NIV but are present in the “King James” or “Authorized” translation of the Bible).
Hence Paul says: 
“Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.
Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will never count against him.” Romans 4:7-8 – NIV
We believe that if Allah had commanded some of His slaves to kill themselves in repentance from their sins, that would not be too much for them to do, and that would not contradict His being kind and merciful. He commanded the Children of Israel to do that when they asked to see God directly, but even then no one was to be killed for anyone else, rather a person was to be killed for his own sins, not for the sins of another. That was the heavy burden and fetters that were upon them (cf. al-A’raf 7:157), from which Allah has spared this ummah (nation/community).
Another matter that disproves the belief in original sin is the texts which mean that each person is responsible for his own actions, as Allah says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Whosoever does a righteous good deed, it is for (the benefit of) his own self; and whosoever does evil, it is against his own self. And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) slaves” [Fussilat 41:46]
“Every person is a pledge for what he has earned” [al-Muddaththir 74:38]
Similarly it says in your Bible: 
“Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you” Matthew 7:1-2 – NIV
“For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what he has done” Matthew 16:27 – NIV
Jesus affirmed the importance of righteous deeds
The Messiah affirmed the importance of righteous deeds, and said to his disciples: 
“Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?'
Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'” Matthew 7:21-22 – NIV
Similarly, he said: 
“The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.
They will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” Matthew 13:41-42 – NIV
He did not tell them of redemption by which they would be saved from the reckoning. 
Those who do righteous deeds are the only ones who will be saved on the Day of Resurrection from the reckoning, whilst those who did evil deeds will be carried off to Hell, with no salvation by the Messiah or by anyone else: 
“… for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice
and come out--those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned. John 5:28-29 – NIV  
“When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory…
Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels’” Matthew 25:31-42 – NIV
The Messiah said to them: 
“You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell?” Matthew 23:33 – NIV
Adolf Hernck noted that the epistles of the Apostles did not include the idea of salvation by redemption, rather they suggested that salvation is attained by good deeds, as it says in the Epistle of James: 
“What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him?
… faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.
… faith without deeds is useless (or dead).” James 2:14 – NIV
And Peter says: 
“I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism
but accepts men from every nation who fear him and do what is right” Acts 10:34-35
There are many similar examples in the words of the Messiah and the disciples. 
Allah the Almighty has spoken the truth (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most honourable of you with Allah is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa [i.e. he is one of the Muttaqun (the pious)]. Verily, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware” [Al-Hujurat 49:13]
What is strange is that Paul himself, who abolished this teaching and said that deeds were to no avail, and that salvation is only by faith, affirmed the importance of righteous deeds on other occasions, such as when he said: 
“A man reaps what he sows
… Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up” Galatians 6:7 – NIV  
“and each will be rewarded according to his own labour” I Corinthians 3:8 – NIV
(For more information on this matter see: Dr Mundhir al-Saqqar: Hal iftadana al-Masih ‘ala al-Salib) 
So you have no way of resolving this contradiction unless you ignore your common sense and reasoning, and delude yourself with false wishes, as you do in the case of the doctrine of trinity and unity, which is what John R Stott advises you to do in his book Basic Christianity: I do not dare to deal with this subject, before I admit frankly that a great deal of it must remain a hidden mystery… I wonder how our weak minds cannot comprehend it fully, but there will inevitably come a day when the veil will be lifted and all mysteries will be resolved, and we will see the Messiah as he really is! 
… How is it possible that God was incarnated in Christ, whilst making Christ a sacrifice for our sin? I cannot answer this, but the Apostle himself places these two truths side by side and I accept the idea completely, just as I accept that Jesus the Nazarene is human and divine in one person… If we cannot resolve this contradiction or solve this mystery, we should accept the truth as proclaimed by Christ and his disciples, that he bore our sins.” (Basic Christianity, p. 110, 121, quoting from Dr Sa’ud al-Khalaf, al-Yahudiyyah wal-Nasraniyyah, p. 238) 
Yes, you and we will see the Messiah as he really is, one of the slaves of Allah who are close to Him, and one of His prophets who were sent, on that Day when the veil will be lifted and he will disavow himself of all those who took him as a god besides Allah, or who attributed to him words that he did not say. At that time there were no mysteries or puzzles: 
“And (remember) when Allah will say (on the Day of Resurrection): ‘O ‘Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)! Did you say unto men: Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah?’ He will say: ‘Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right (to say). Had I said such a thing, You would surely have known it. You know what is in my inner-self though I do not know what is in Yours; truly, You, only You, are the All-Knower of all that is hidden (and unseen).
‘Never did I say to them aught except what You (Allah) did command me to say: Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them while I dwelt amongst them, but when You took me up, You were the Watcher over them; and You are a Witness to all things. (This is a great admonition and warning to the Christians of the whole world).
‘If You punish them, they are Your slaves, and if You forgive them, verily, You, only You, are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.’
Allah will say: ‘This is a Day on which the truthful will profit from their truth: theirs are Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise) — they shall abide therein forever. Allah is pleased with them and they with Him. That is the great success (Paradise).
To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is therein, and He is Able to do all things.” [Al-Maidah 5:116-120]
Will you think about it before it is too late? 
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allah (Alone), and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allah.’ Then, if they turn away, say: ‘Bear witness that we are Muslims’” [Aal ‘Imran 3:64].

42574,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42574,A mistake in the direction of the qiblah,"One of my neighbours told me that the qiblah towards which I was praying was wrong and was not in accordance with the qiblah of the neighbouring mosque. Based on this, I changed the direction for a few months, including last Ramadaan. Then I found out that the first qiblah had been correct. What is the ruling on prayers that I did facing the incorrect qiblah? I hope you can answer me because I am confused. Thank you very much.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Facing the qiblah is one of the conditions of prayer being valid. Every worshipper has to make sure he faces the qiblah in his prayer, and strive to make sure he is facing in the right direction, whether by means of natural signs or using a compass, if he is able to do that, or by asking trustworthy people in that place who know in which direction the qiblah is. 
It seems most likely in the case that you describe that the deviation from the qiblah was very slight. This slight deviation is something that can happen when a person who lives in that area is a little confused and people do not pay attention to this slight difference in direction. If that is the case, i.e., if the deviation from the qiblah was slight, then it does not matter and it does not invalidate the prayer, because those who are far away from the Ka’bah have to face in its general direction; they do not have to face precisely in that direction, because al-Tirmidhi (342) and Ibn Maajah (1011) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whatever is between the east and the west is the qiblah.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in al-Irwa’. 
Al-San’aani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Subul al-Salam (1/260). This hadith indicates that what is required is to face in that direction, and not towards the precise location of the Ka’bah when one cannot see it. 
Further evidence to this effect is to be seen in the report narrated by al-Bukhari (144) and Muslim (264) from Abu Ayyoob (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If you need to relieve yourself, then do not face the qiblah or turn your back towards it, whether you are urinating or defecating, rather face to the east or to the west.” 
Shaykh al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh al-‘Umdah: This is stating that facing any direction other than the east or the west means that one is either facing the qiblah or turning one’s back towards it. This was addressed to the people of Madeenah and everyone who was in the same direction (in relation to Makkah), because this was the consensus of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them). ‘Umar said: Whatever is between the east and the west is the qiblah except at the House.  And it was narrated that ‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) said: How can a man make a mistake in his prayer when whatever is between the east and the west is the qiblah, so long he does not turn towards the east deliberately. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Thus we know that the matter is broad in scope. So if we see a person praying in a direction that is slightly off from the qiblah, that does not matter, because he is facing in its general direction, and this is what he is obliged to do. 
Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 2/273 
But if the deviation from the direction of the qiblah was very great, so that you were not praying in the direction of the qiblah at all, such as if you were praying towards the east when the qiblah is towards the west or the north, for example, so long as you based your action on the words of someone who you know attaches great importance to the prayer and you thought that they knew better about the direction of the qiblah, then you do not have to do anything, and the prayers which you offered are still valid, even if you faced the wrong direction when you prayed, because if a person tries his best to get it right, he has done what is required of him, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can” [Al-Taghaabun 64:16]
It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (6/314): If a worshipper does his best to figure out the direction of the qiblah and prays, then he finds out that he was mistaken, his prayer is still valid. 
In Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) (10/421) it says: If a believer does his best to figure out the direction of the qiblah, when he is in the desert or is in a city in which he is not sure where the qiblah is, and he prays on that basis, then he finds out that he prayed in a direction other than the qiblah, then he should continue to pray according to his latest estimate, if he believes that it is more correct than his first estimate. His first prayer is still valid because he did his best to work out the qiblah.",Islam Q&A
42579,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42579,Fatwa from the Standing Committee on the “Business and “Hibbat al-Jazeerah” companies and pyramid marketing schemes,"The Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas has received many questions about pyramid marketing companies such as the “Business” and “Hibbat al-Jazeerah” companies, whose work may be summed up as being the attempt to convince a person to buy a product on the basis that he will also convince others to buy; they in turn will convince others, and so on. The more levels of participants there are, the more the first person will gain in commission, reaching thousands of riyals. Every participant convinces others to join in return for a large commission, if he is successful in getting new customers to join his list of members. This is what is called pyramid marketing or network marketing.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      The Committee replied: This kind of dealing is haraam, 
      because the purpose of this dealing is to earn commission, not to buy the 
      product. The commission may reach tens of thousands, whilst the product is 
      not worth more than a few hundred. Any smart person who is offered a 
      choice between the two will choose the commission. Hence these companies 
      rely on marketing and advertising of their product which emphasizes the 
      size of the large commission which the participant can earn, and offers 
      the incentive of a large profit in return for a small sum, which is the 
      price of the product. The product marketed by such companies is merely a 
      screen or a means of earning these commissions and profits. Because this 
      commission is really the point of the transaction, it is haraam according 
      to sharee’ah for several reasons: 

    1 – It involves riba of two types, riba al-fadl (involving 
    exchange of goods of the same type but of different quantity) and riba 
    al-nasi’ah (involving deferred payment of a larger amount than would be paid 
    if it were paid immediately). The participant pays a small amount of money 
    in order to gain a lot of money, in other words he pays cash for cash of a 
    different amount and with deferred payment. This is the kind of riba that is 
    forbidden according to the texts and to scholarly consensus. The product 
    which the company sells to the agent is simply a screen for this 
    transaction; it is not what the participant is seeking and it makes no 
    difference to the ruling. 

    2 – It is a kind of gharar (ambiguous transaction) that is 
    forbidden in sharee’ah, because the participant does not know whether he 
    will be successful in finding the number of purchasers (participants) 
    required or not. No matter how long pyramid or network marketing lasts, it 
    must inevitably reach an end, and when a person joins the pyramid he does 
    not know whether he will be in a higher level and thus make a profit, or in 
    the lower levels and thus make a loss. The fact of the matter is that most 
    of the members of the pyramid lose out, except for the few at the top. So 
    what usually happens is loss, which is the case of all ambiguous 
    transactions. One of two things may happen, and it is usually the one that 
    is most feared. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    forbade ambiguous transactions, as was narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh. 

    3 – These transactions involve consuming people’s wealth 
    unlawfully, because these contracts benefit no one but the companies and 
    some participants whom the company encourages with the aim of tricking 
    others. This is what is forbidden in the Qur’aan, where Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “O you who believe! Eat not up your property among 
    yourselves unjustly”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:29]
4 – This transaction 
    involves cheating, deceiving and tricking people, by showing the product as 
    if that is the purpose of this transaction, when that is not the case, and 
    by enticing them with the idea of large commission which people do not 
    usually earn. This is the kind of deceit that is forbidden in sharee’ah. The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever 
    deceives us is not one of us.” Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh. And 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The two 
    parties to a transaction have the choice, so long as they have not parted. 
    If they are sincere and open in their dealings, the transaction will be 
    blessed for them, but if they lie and conceal anything, the blessing of 
    their transaction will be erased.” Agreed upon. 

    With regard to the view that this transaction is a kind of 
    brokerage, this is not true. Brokerage is a transaction whereby the broker 
    receives payment in return for selling the product, whereas in network 
    marketing the participant pays a fee in order to market the product. 
    Brokerage means marketing the product in a real sense, unlike network 
    marketing where the real aim is to market the transaction, not the product, 
    so the participant markets to others who will market to others who will 
    market to others and so on, unlike brokerage in which the broker markets the 
    product to those who really want the product. The difference between the two 
    is quite clear. 

    With regard to the view that the transaction is a kind of 
    gift, this is also not true. Even if we accept that, not every gift is 
    permissible according to sharee’ah. A gift given in return for a loan is 
    riba. Hence ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Salaam said to Abu Burdah (may Allaah be pleased 
    with them both): “You are in a land where riba is widespread among them. If 
    you have some right over a man and he gives you a load of straw or a load of 
    barley or a load of fodder, this is riba.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari in his 
    Saheeh. 

    Gifts are subject to the rulings on the reason for which they 
    are given. Hence the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said, concerning the zakaat-collector who came and said: “This is for 
    you and this is what was given to me as a gift”: “Why don’t you sit in the 
    house of your father and mother and see whether you are given any gifts or 
    not?” Agreed upon. 

    These commissions are only paid for the purpose of joining 
    the network marketing scheme, no matter what names are given to them, 
    whether they are called gifts or anything else. That does not change their 
    nature or the ruling on them in the slightest. 

    It is worth mentioning that there are companies that have 
    appeared in the market which follow the practices of network marketing or 
    pyramid marketing, such as “Smartest Way”, “Gold Quest” and “Seven 
    Diamonds”. The ruling on these companies is no different from the ruling on 
    the companies mentioned above, even though the products they offer may 
    vary. 

    And Allaah is the Source of strength. May Allaah send 
    blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and 
    companions.","Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas. Fatwa no. 22935, dated 14/3/1425 AH"
42582,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42582,"Ruling on cauterizing, and reconciling ahaadeeth on this topic which appear to contradict one another","It is narrated in a saheeh report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade cauterizing, but it is also narrated that he did it. What is the correct ruling on cauterizing and how can we reconcile the ahaadeeth which appear to contradict one another?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Many ahaadeeth have been narrated on the topic of 
      cauterizing, which the scholars divided into four categories. 
1 – Those which indicate 
    that it is permissible, such as the hadeeth of Jaabir who said: Ubayy was 
    struck by an arrow in his medial arm vein on the day of al-Ahzaab, and the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    cauterized it. Narrated by Muslim, 2207. 

    2 – Those which indicate that he did not like it, such as the 
    hadeeth of Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: I heard the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “If there is 
    anything good in your medicine it is in the instrument of the cupper or 
    drinking honey or cauterizing with fire that suits the ailment, but I would 
    not like to be cauterized.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5683; Muslim, 2205. 

    3 – Those which praise those who do not do that, such as the 
    hadeeth of ‘Imraan ibn Husayn concerning the seventy thousand who will enter 
    Paradise without being brought to account: “… those who did not use 
    cauterization.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6541, and Muslim, 218. 

    In the hadeeth of ‘Imraan ibn Husayn (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) it says that the angels would greet him because he did not use 
    cauterization. When he used it, they stopped greeting him, then when he 
    stopped using it, they started to greet him again. Narrated by Muslim, 
    1226. 

    4 – Those which indicate that cauterization is makrooh, such 
    as the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah have mercy on him) who said that 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Healing 
    is to be found in three things: the instrument of the cupper, drinking honey 
    and cauterization with fire, but I forbid my ummah to use cauterization.” 
    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5681. 

    This is how the reports may be reconciled. Forbidding here 
    means that it is makrooh, and the ahaadeeth which say that he did it 
    indicate that it is permissible when there is a need for it. 

    Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: I do not know of any scholarly 
    difference of opinion, for they did not see anything wrong with 
    cauterization if there was a need for it. 
The reason why it is makrooh is because it 
    causes suffering and pain.",Islam Q&A
