66803,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66803,He agrees with the opinion of Ibn Hazm about intimacy. Is it permissible for his wife to engage in foreplay with him when he is fasting?,"If a husband follows the opinion of the Zaahiris (literalists), Ibn Hazm and al-Albaani, which says that emission of semen when fasting without having intercourse does not invalidate the fast, is it permissible for his wife to engage in foreplay with her husband during the day in Ramadaan, even if that results in emission of madhiy (prostatic fluid) or maniy (semen) from him?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The ruling 
    on emission of madhiy is different from the ruling on emission of maniy. The 
    most correct scholarly view is that emission of madhiy does not invalidate 
    the fast, whether it is from a man or a woman. The scholars' opinions on 
    this issue have been mentioned in the answer to question no.
    49752. 
Secondly: 
It should be 
    noted that it is not permissible for anyone to adopt the opinion of any 
    scholar on the basis of convenience, or because this opinion suits his whims 
    and desires. When there is a difference of scholarly opinion, what we must 
    do is that which Allaah has enjoined in the verse where He says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“(And) if 
    you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allaah and His 
    Messenger, if you believe in Allaah and in the Last Day. That is better and 
    more suitable for final determination”
[al-Nisa’ 
    4:59]
It is not 
    permissible for anyone to say: I will follow the opinion of such and such a 
    scholar, and thus go against a hadeeth which is proven from the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
Hence Imam 
    al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The scholars are 
    unanimously agreed that if a Sunnah of the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) is proven, it is not permissible to forsake it for 
    the opinion of anyone. End quote. Madaarij al-Saalikeen (2/335). 
Once the 
    ruling is proven with saheeh evidence, no one’s opinion counts, no matter 
    who he is. 
The view 
    that masturbation or intimacy with one's wife to the point of ejaculation 
    are among the things that invalidate the fast is the view of the majority of 
    scholars, including the four imams, Abu Haneefah, Maalik, al-Shaafa’i and 
    Ahmad. They quoted as evidence the fact that it is satisfaction of desire, 
    and that is forbidden to the person who is fasting, because Allaah says, 
    according to the hadeeth qudsi about the fasting person: “He gives up his 
    food, his drink and his desire for My sake.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari 
    (1894). 
This has 
    been explained in detail in the answer to questions no.
    71213and 65698. 
We do not 
    deny that there is a difference of opinion on this issue. Ibn Hazm and 
    Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on them) both thought that emission 
    of semen as the result of intimacy with one's wife does not invalidate the 
    fast. If someone adopts this opinion on the basis of knowledge and follows 
    it on the basis of evidence, not on the basis of his whims and desires, then 
    there is no sin on him for that, because a person is only responsible within 
    the framework of his knowledge, but that is subject to the condition that he 
    only believes that on the basis of what evidence and scholarly opinions he 
    has available to him, and is not simply looking for a concession and the 
    easiest opinion. 
It is not 
    permissible for a Muslim to follow the mistakes of the scholars; if he does 
    that, all evil will be combined in him. Hence the scholars said: Whoever 
    follows a matter concerning which the scholars differed and follows the 
    easiest opinion is a heretic, or almost a heretic. End quote. See also the 
    answer to question no. 22652. 
What we 
    advise the questioner to do is to be content with that which the scholars 
    have agreed is permissible, which is intimacy in the form of touching or 
    kissing, without ejaculating, so as to protect his fast and fulfil his duty, 
    and for fear of falling into that which is haraam and invalidates the fast 
    according to consensus, namely intercourse.

66822,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66822,She could not find a poor person to feed instead of fasting in Ramadaan – should she give the money in charity?,I am a sick woman suffering from a chronic illness. My doctor advised me not to fast and I cannot find any poor person to feed. How much money may I give instead?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.We ask Allaah to bless you with healing and to make this sickness an expiation for your sins and to raise you in status in the Hereafter. 
The person who is chronically sick and unable to fast or make up the missed fasts is not obliged to fast, but he must feed one poor person for each day, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskeen (poor person) (for every day).”
[al-Baqarah 2:184]
‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: This has not been abrogated. It refers to an old man or an old woman who are unable to fast; they should feed one poor person for each day. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4505.
The sick person for whom there is no hope of recovery comes under the same ruling as an old man. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
The sick person who has no hope of recovery may break the fast, and he should feed one poor person for each day, because he is like an old man. End quote. 
Al-Mughni, 4/396 
The Muslim lands are full of poor and needy people who cannot find enough to feed them and their families. There is no state that is without its poor, even if they are hard to find in some countries. No country is without its charitable committees who take on the task of making sure that zakaah and charity reach those who are entitled to them. 
Even if you cannot find a poor person to give food to, what are you going to do with the money that is equal to the value of the food? To whom will you give this money? This means that the problem is still there. It is not permissible to give this money – even if it were permissible to give it in the form of money – to anyone but the poor and needy who are entitled to it. 
Whatever the case, you must try hard to look for poor and needy people in your country. Even if you do not know them, you can delegate someone whose religious commitment you trust to give this food to someone who is entitled to it. It makes no difference whether it is an individual or a charitable organization. 
Remember that it is not permissible for you to give money – no matter how much – instead of giving the fidyah that has been enjoined upon you, because Allaah has enjoined upon you “to feed a Miskeen (poor person)”, and He has not enjoined you to give money. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskeen (poor person) (for every day).”
[al-Baqarah 2:184]

66824,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66824,Ruling on entering bathhouses and uncovering the awrah for a massage,"Is it permissible for a person to go to traditional bathhouses during Ramadan and have a massage, knowing that the masseur in the bathhouse will see me naked, in addition to my uncovering myself in front of the other people in the bathhouse? Will this affect the fast?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to go to those bathhouses in which these evils occur, whether in Ramadan or at any other time, but entering them during Ramadan is more sinful. Fasting does not only mean giving up food, drink and intercourse, rather it means giving up all haraam things and keeping away from all evil actions. 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does not give up false speech and acting upon it, there is no need for him to give up his food and drink.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1804. 
‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Fasting is not just (giving up) food and drink, rather it is giving up lying, falsehood and idle talk.” 
Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah al-Ansaari (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “When you fast, then let your hearing, your sight and your tongue fast from lying and sin, stop abusing servants and be tranquil and dignified on the day when you fast. Do not let the day when you do not fast and the day when you fast be the same.” 
What happens in those bathhouses, such as uncovering and touching the ‘awrah, are evil actions, and Allah describes His believing slaves as being those who lower their gaze and guard their private parts (against sin). Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts)
6. Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their right hands possess, __ for then, they are free from blame”
[al-Mu’minoon 23:5,6]
Indeed, Allah enjoins that, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts). That is purer for them. Verily, Allah is All‑Aware of what they do”
[al-Noor 24:30]
If you ponder the end of the verse, you will find a stern warning against going against the command to lower the gaze and guard the private parts. It was narrated from Mu’aawiyah ibn Haydah al-Qushayri (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, with regard to our ‘awrah, what may we uncover of it and what must we conceal? He said: “Cover your ‘awrah except from your wife and those whom your right hand possesses (i.e., concubines).” I said, O Messenger of Allah, what if a man is with another man? He said, “If you can make sure that no one sees it, then do not let anyone see it.” I said, O Messenger of Allah, what if one of us is alone? He said, “Allah is more deserving that you should feel shy before Him than people.” Narrated and classed as hasan by al-Timridhi (2769); narrated by Ibn Maajah (1920); classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan Ibn Maajah.  
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) expressly forbade one man to look at the ‘awrah of another, or one woman to look at the ‘awrah of another. It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No man should look at the ‘awrah of another man, and no woman should look at the ‘awrah of another woman.” Narrated by Muslim, 338. 
It is well known that looking at ‘awrahs and touching and massaging parts of the body may provoke desire and lead to temptation and evil. This massage is not a medical treatment such that we can say that is it permissible subject to certain conditions. Rather it is a kind of pleasure which can be done at home by one’s wife or using machines. This is not something that can be regarded as a necessity. 
Hence going to these bathhouses is haraam, and doing it in Ramadan is even more haraam and reduces the reward of the one who fasts, and it may erase his reward altogether. See the answer to question no. 50063.

    time when the fast ends, which is the time of Maghrib prayer. There is no 
    sin on the one who asks about the time of iftaar so that he may enjoy the 
    things that Allaah has permitted to him of food, drink and intercourse, and 
    to feel the joy of having completed his worship. It was narrated that Abu 
    Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The fasting person has 
    two moments of joy: when he breaks his fast he rejoices at breaking his 
    fast, and when he meets his Lord he will rejoice at his fasting.” Narrated 
    by al-Bukhaari, 1805; Muslim, 1151. 

    Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    Al-Qurtubi said: What this means is that he rejoices at the 
    disappearance of his hunger and thirst when it becomes permissible for him 
    to break his fast. This joy is something natural and this is the first 
    meaning that comes to mind. And it was said that his joy when breaking the 
    fast is because he has completed his fast and finished his act of worship, 
    and his Lord is allowing him now to eat and drink, which will help him to 
    fast more.  
I say: There is no reason 
    why it should not be interpreted in a manner that is more general than what 
    has been mentioned. Everyone rejoices according to his status, because 
    people vary with regard to that. Some of them feel a kind of joy that is 
    permissible, and that is natural. Others feel a kind of joy that is 
    mustahabb, if it is because of the reasons mentioned above.

66886,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66886,What is the definition of the poor to whom the fidyah for not fasting may be given? And how much should be given and when?,"Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “to feed a Miskeen (poor person) (for every day)” [al-Baqarah 2:184]. Is it essential that this poor person be an adult? If a person wants to feed thirty poor persons, are the children and dependents of a poor person included in this number? Is it acceptable to give money instead of food? How much food should be given?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
It is not permissible for anyone who is able to fast in Ramadan, and who has no legitimate excuse, not to fast. Not everyone who does not fast because of a concession is required to feed a poor person for every day. Rather feeding the poor is required of those who are elderly or are suffering a chronic illness for which there is no hope of recovery. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskeen (poor person) (for every day).” [al-Baqarah 2:184]
Ibn ‘Abbaas said: This refers to an old man or an old woman who are not able to fast, so for each day they should feed one poor person.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4505. 
The person who is suffering from a chronic illness from which there is no hope of recovery comes under the same ruling as an old man.

The sick person for whom there is no hope of recovery may break the fast, and he should feed one poor person for each day, because he is like an old man.""(Al-Mughni, 4/396). 
Secondly: 
It is not essential that this poor person be an adult, rather the food may be given to a child who eats regular food, according to scholarly consensus. But the imams differed with regard to giving it to a nursing infant. The majority of scholars (including Abu Haneefah, al-Shaafa’i and Ahmad) are of the view that this is permissible, because he is a poor person who is included in the general meaning of this verse. The apparent meaning of the words of Imam Maalik is that food should not be given to a nursing infant, but he said that it is permissible to give it to a weanling. This view was favoured by al-Muwaffaq Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him). 
See: al-Mughni, 13/508; al-Insaaf, 23/342; al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 35/101-103. 
Thirdly: 
The children, wife and family of a poor person on whom he is obliged to spend may be included in this number, if they do not have enough to live on and there is no one else who can spend on them apart from this poor man. 
Hence the poor man may be given zakaah that is sufficient for him and his family. 
It says in al-Rawd al-Murbi’ (3/311): 
The two types – i.e., the poor (fuqara’) and needy (masaakeen) – may both be given what is sufficient for them and their dependents. End quote. 
Fourthly: 
As for what is to be given and how much, the poor person should be given half a saa’ (approximately one and a half kilograms) of the local staple food, whether it is rice, dates or anything else. If some condiment or meat is also given, that is better.
Al-Bukhari narrated in a mu’allaq report from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that when he grew old and was unable to fast, he did not fast and he would give bread and meat to a poor person for each day. 
It is not permissible to give the equivalent value of the food in money. 
Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allah preserve him) said: 
Feeding the poor is not to be done by giving cash as you mentioned, rather it is done by giving the food that is the local staple food. So each day half a saa’ of the usual local staple food is to be given, and half a saa’ is equivalent to approximately one and half kilograms. 
So you have to give this amount of the local staple food for each day, and do not give cash, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskeen (poor person) (for every day).” [al-Baqarah 2:184]

Does uncovering the ‘awrah break your fast?","Praise be to Allah.Is showing the ‘awrah haram?
Showing the `awrah in front of others for whom it is not permissible to see it is haram. It is not permissible for anyone to do that, whether in Ramadan or at any other time. It is haram to uncover the ‘awrah and it is haram to look at it. 
Bahz ibn Hakim narrated from his father that his grandfather [Mu’awiyah ibn Haydah al-Qushayri] (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, with regard to our `awrah, what may we uncover of it and what must we conceal?

Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “This shows that it is haram for a man to look at the `awrah of another man and for a woman to look at the `awrah of another woman, and there is no difference of opinion concerning that.” (Sharh Muslim, 4/30) 
But if the issue is showing the `awrah unintentionally, then there is no sin on you, and the other person has to avert his gaze and not look at it.

For a long time we have relied on the Umm al-Quraa timetable for the times of beginning and ending the fast, and the times for prayer, following the same times as Makkah al-Mukarramah. But a year or more ago, the brothers in the cooperative office distributed a timetable specifically for the al-Qunfudhah Governorate, in which there is a difference of ten minutes, sometimes less and sometimes more. The problem now is that the people have become divided into two groups: some villages are following the timetable for Makkah al-Mukarramah and others are following this new timetable that is specifically for our governorate. Now our problem with fasting is: is the fast of those who follow the timetable for Makkah al-Mukarramah, which is ten minutes later than the timetable for al-Qunfudhah, regarded as not valid, because in this case they are regarded as having started to fast after the adhaan, if the new timetable for the governorate is correct?
We hope that you can explain the issue clearly, because the people are arguing and disputing.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly:
It is not permissible to rely on the timetables that are widespread among people unless two conditions are met:
That the organisation that issues a timetable should be people of knowledge and experience.
That the time for beginning the fast should be specific to the town for which the timetable is issued. It is not permissible for someone who is living far away from a town to rely on its timetable, because of the differences in timings between the two towns.
If someone does not have a timetable that he can rely on for the times of beginning and ending the fast, then he can check for himself the times of the true dawn and sunset by observing them himself, or he can follow a trustworthy mu’adhdhin who knows the proper times. If it is known that the mu’adhdhin only gives the adhaan at the time of the true dawn, then he must stop eating and drinking as soon as he hears his adhaan. If it is known that he gives the adhaan after sunset, then it is permissible for the fasting person to break the fast, and no attention should be paid to the adhaan of one who gives the adhaan some time before dawn or after sunset so as to be on the safe side.
Secondly:
In the answer to question no. 8048, we quoted Shaykh ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan al-Barraak as saying: These timetables have become a means for people to know the times for the prayers to the hour and minute, and we should pay attention to that.
But this does not mean that there are no mistakes in those timetables. In the answer to question no. 26763, we quoted from Shaykh al-Albaani an explanation of the mistakes in some timetables, particularly with regard to the time of Fajr, and this was based on his investigation into the issue (may Allah have mercy on him).
It is well-known that the Umm al-Quraa timetable is very accurate and highly credible. Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abdillah Aal ash-Shaykh, the Grand Mufti of the Kingdom, President of the Council of Senior Scholars and President of the Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas affirmed – in a Friday khutbah – that the Umm al-Quraa timetable is precise, in accordance with shar‘i rules, and authenticated, and it cannot be doubted.
And he said:
The scholars of this ummah have deemed this timetable to be trustworthy. It has been tested, applied and proven that it is in accordance with the timings prescribed in sharee‘ah. Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abdullah ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) issued a statement in 1418 AH in which he confirmed that the Umm al-Quraa timetable is trustworthy. End quote.
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) also stated that there is only a slight difference, five minutes, with regard to Fajr.
See the answer to question no. 66202.
 Thirdly:
With regard to the city of al-Qunfudhah, it is located on the coast of the Red Sea, halfway between Makkah and Jeddah to the north and Jazan to the south. It is 380 km south of Makkah and Jeddah, and is located at the intersection of the line of longitude 41.5 degrees east, and the line of latitude 19.8 degrees north.
With regard to Mecca, it is located at the line of latitude 21.27 degrees north and the line of longitude 39.49 east.
By studying the times of the prayers according to the Umm al-Quraa timetable, we see a difference in the times, that is in accordance with the distance between Makkah and al-Qunfudhah. Therefore it is not valid for the people of al-Qunfudhah to rely on the timetable and adhaan of Makkah.
On this day – 30 Rajab 1426 AH – for example, the times of the prayers are as follows:

City


Fajr


Shurooq


Zuhr


‘Asr


Maghrib


‘Ishaa’


Makkah


4.44

It becomes clear that what the brothers in the cooperative office have distributed to you, of a timetable that is specific to your region, is valid, and the differences that you mention are in fact correct. So you must pay attention to this. We ask Allah to help you and guide you to do that which pleases Him.
