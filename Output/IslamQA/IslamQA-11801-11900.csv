“And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).” [51:56]
i.e., to believe in His Oneness and to devote their worship to Him alone, to the exclusion of all others. One of the conditions of worship being correct is belief in His Messenger [Muhammad] (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and following his example, for he is the example to be followed, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

If a sick person is not cured by reading (Qur’aan and du’aa’s), then we should note that medicine does not guarantee a cure either, because not every treatment produces the desired result. Allaah may delay the healing for a long time, or the person may die from this sickness. It is not a condition of treatment that the person should be healed. If a person is treated by reading Qur’aan and does not recover, that is not an excuse for turning to sihr, because we are commanded to take the permissible means prescribed in sharee’ah, and we are forbidden to use haraam means. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “O slaves of Allaah, seek treatment but do not seek treatment with that which has been forbidden to you.” And it was narrated that he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah does not make your healing in that which He has forbidden to you.” 
All things are in the hand of Allaah, may He be glorified. He is the One Who heals whomsoever He wills, and He decrees sickness and death for whomsoever He wills, as He says (interpretation of the meanings): 
“And if Allaah touches you with harm, none can remove it but He, and if He touches you with good, then He is Able to do all things” [al-An’aam 6:17]
 “And if Allaah touches you with harm, there is none who can remove it but He; and if He intends any good for you, there is none who can repel His Favour which He causes it to reach whomsoever of His slaves He wills. And He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful [Yoonus 10:107]
 So the Muslim must be patient and seek reward with Allaah. He must limit himself to the means that Allaah has permitted, and beware of that which Allaah has forbidden, whilst also believing that the decree of Allaah is beneficial and that His command cannot be put back, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings):  
“Verily, His Command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, ‘Be!’ and it is! [Yaa-Seen 36:82]

Do you need witnesses to become a Muslim?
The purpose of this answer is to correct a false idea spread among those willing to adopt Islam as their faith. Some people have a wrong notion that entering into the Islamic fold requires an announcement from the concerned person in the presence of high ranking scholars or shaykhs or reporting this act to courts of justice or other authorities. It is also thought that the act of accepting Islam, should, as a condition, have a certificate issued by the authorities, as evidence to that effect.
Is it difficult to become a Muslim?
We wish to clarify that the whole matter is very easy and that none of these conditions or obligations are required. For Allah, Almighty, is above all comprehension and knows well the secrets of all hearts. Nevertheless, those who are going to adopt Islam as their religion are advised to register themselves as Muslims with the concerned governmental agency, as this procedure may facilitate for them many matters including the possibility of performing Hajj (Pilgrimage) and ‘Umrah.
How to convert to Islam and become a Muslim?
If anyone has a real desire to be a Muslim and has full conviction and strong belief that Islam is the true religion ordained by Allah for all human-beings, then, one should pronounce the “shahadah ”, the testimony of faith, without further delay. The Noble Quran is explicit in this regard as Allah states:
“The Religion in the sight of Allah is Islam” (Quran 3:19)
In another verse of the Quran, Allah states:
“If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to Allah), Never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost (their selves in the Hellfire).” (Quran 3:85)
In addition, Islam is the only religion prevailing over all other religions. Allah states in the Quran:
“To thee We sent the Scripture in the truth, confirming the scripture that came before it, and guarding it in safety:…. (Quran 5:48)
Muhammad, the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessing of Allah be upon him), said:
“The superstructure of Islam is raised on five (pillars): testifying that there is no God (none truly worthy of worship) but Allah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, performing the prayer, paying the Zakah (poor-due), fasting the month of Ramadan, and performing Hajj.” 
How to pronounce Shahadah
The Shahadah can be declared as follows:
 “ASH-HADU ALLA ILAHA ILLA-ALLAH WA ASH-HADU ANNA MUHAMMADAN RASUL-ALLAH”.
Shahadah in English
The English translation of the shahadah is:
“I bear witness that there is no deity (none worthy of worship) but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.”
Conversion to Islam should be based on full conviction
However, it would not be sufficient for anyone to only utter this testimony orally either in private or in public; but rather, he should believe in it in his heart with a firm conviction and unshakeable faith. If one is truly sincere and complies with the teachings of Islam in all his life, he will find himself a new born person. 
This will move him to strive more and more to improve his character and draw nearer to perfection. The light of the living faith will fill his heart until he becomes the embodiment of that faith.
What would be next after declaring oneself a Muslim? One should then know the real concept underlying this testimony which means the oneness of Allah and meet its requirements. One must behave accordingly, applying this true faith to everything one speaks or does.
The meaning of the Shahadah
What do the words of the “Shahadah” signify? The significant point which every Muslim must know very well is the truth that there is no God (deity) to be worshipped other than Allah. He-glory be to Him – is the only true God, Who Alone deserves to be worshipped, since He is the Giver of life and Sustainer and Nourisher of mankind and all creation with His unlimited bounties. Man must worship Allah, Who Alone is worthy of worship.
The second part of the Shahadah “i.e., Wa Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan ‘abduhu wa rasuluh” means that Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) is the servant and chosen Messenger of Allah. 
No one must have two opinions about this matter. In fact the Muslim has to obey the commands of the Prophet (peace and blessing of Allah be upon him), to believe him in what he has said, to practise his teachings, to avoid what he has forbidden, and to worship Allah alone according to the message revealed to him, for all the teachings of the Prophet were in fact revelation and inspirations conveyed to him by Allah.
What is worship according to Islam?
What is the meaning of worship ? It simply means rendering sincere service, showing reverence for Allah. In a deeper shade of meaning, it implies total submission and complete obedience to Allah’s commandments both in utterances and actions of man whether explicit or implicit.
What are the forms of worship in Islam?
Worship falls into two categories:

Visible (manifest or outward).
Invisible (concealed or inward).

Visible worship includes acts such as uttering the two parts of the “Shahadah”, performing prayers, giving Zakah (the poor-due), recitation of the Quran, supplication, adoring Allah by praising Him, purifying our bodies before prayers, etc.
This type of worship is associated with movement of the parts of the human body. 
Invisible worship is to believe in Allah, in the Day of Judgement (in the Hereafter), in the Angels, in the Books of Allah, in the prophets of Allah, in the Divine Decree of destiny (that good and bad are determined by Allah Alone).
This type of worship does not involve movement of parts of the body but it surely has bearing on one’s heart which subsequently affects one’s way of life. 
It should be borne in mind that any worship not dedicated to Allah Alone will be rejected as one form of polytheism and this causes apostasy from the Islamic fold.
What’s after taking the Shahadah?
The next step for a new revert to Islam is to purify himself by taking a complete bath. He should then resolve to comply with the principles and rules of Islam in their entirety. He should disown all forms of polytheism and false beliefs. He should reject evil and be righteous. Such rejection of evil and being righteous is one of the requisites of the motto of Islam – that is, La ilaha illallah . 
Allah states in the Holy qur’an:
“…whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah hath grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold, that never breaks…” (Quran 2:256).
We have to consider that when we declare from our heart that “there is no god (deity) worthy to be worshipped but Allah”, it implies on our part love, devotion, faith and obedience to the rules of Islamic legislations which are legally binding on all Muslims. It is a requirement of “there is no god worthy to be  worshipped but Allah” to love for the sake of Allah and to reject for the sake of Allah.
This is the firmest anchor of belief which materializes the meaning of “AL WALA” and “AL BARA”. It means that a Muslim should love and be loyal to his Muslim brothers. He should, as a practice, dissociate himself completely from the unbelievers and refuse to be influenced by them, both in worldly and religious matters.
We conclude with a humble prayer to Allah that may He cleanse the hearts and souls of those who are genuine seekers of truth and may He bless the community of believers.

11865,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11865,How many times should he call a non-Muslim to Islam?,"For up to many times should we conduct Islamic lectures to a group of non-muslims who seems not interested to what we are conveying. We are a volunteer dawah brothers and we use to visit workshops, factories, hospitals to make dawah. Oftentimes we make a visit which last 4 to 5 times in one place. But we noticed nobody is listening. Some only stayed just because the owner of the establishment ordered (obliges) them to attend.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We ask Allaah to reward you with good, and to bless your work and your efforts. 
There is no specific number of times that you should give lectures to those whom you mention. That depends on the number of places you visit and the time that is given to you, and the extent to which the people are responsive. The daa’iyah is required to be wise in giving da’wah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would try to choose the right time for preaching to his companions so that they would not get bored, and this is how you should be. Strive to call people to Islam in a way that is better, and choose suitable times and places for da’wah. 
The daa’iyah should not despair if he makes da’wah time after time and sees little response. Hearts are in the hand of Allaah, and all the daa’iyah has to do is to convey the message. A word that the daa’iyah thinks little of may have an effect on a person’s heart years later, and may be the cause of his being guided. 
In order for this word to bear fruit, it should be accompanied with a smile, compassion and a sincere desire to save these poor people and bring them forth from the darkness of kufr and atheism.  If the daa’iyah can add some money or help to his words, let him do so, for that give credibility to the values and principles to which he is calling people, and may prepare people’s hearts to accept the goodness that comes to them and remove any hatred, resistance and objections. 
Also strive to solve any problems that these people may have with their bosses at work. This will have a great effect in softening their hearts towards the daa’iyah. Long ago the poet said: 
Be kind to people, you will win their hearts… 
Even better than that is the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one which is better (i.e. Allaah orders the faithful believers to be patient at the time of anger, and to excuse those who treat them badly) then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend”
[Fussilat 41:34]
You should leave with these people something that they can look at in their spare time, when you are not there, such as pamphlets and booklets. If a person thinks about the truth when he is on his own, he is more likely to accept it and submit to it. 
Part of your da’wah should be addressed to the bosses themselves, advising them to treat these workers well and to show them the good morals and attitudes of Islam. Often that is a cause of the workers embracing Islam, just as the bad attitude of a boss and his mistreatment of his workers may be a cause of their resisting Islam. 
May Allaah help you to guide others and make you truly guided.

11872,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11872,Obedience is only with regard to that which is right and proper,"If a man threatens to divorce his wife unless she does some prohibited deed, what should she do?",,,"Praise be to Allah.We should note that there is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience to the Creator, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Obedience is only with regard to that which is right and proper.” Haram actions do not come under the heading of that which is right and proper, rather this is an evil deed, so if the husband threatens his wife and says that he will divorce her if she does not do it, she should try to explain to him and warn him that this is haram and is not permitted, and she should explain the evidence for that. The questioner does not explain what the haram deed is and to what degree it is forbidden. She should tell us what it is so that we can answer more clearly. But the basic principle is that she should not do it and that there is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator. 
This woman should refuse to do the haram action, because obedience to Allah takes precedence over obedience to her husband. She should strive and seek reward, and turn to Allah and pray to Him and beseech Him to guide her husband away from such deeds. For du’a is a mighty weapon, and Allah will not turn away one who asks of Him. 
Moreover, she can buy him some books or tapes, and seek the help – after Allah – of one of her relatives or one of the seekers of knowledge in her city, or the imam of a mosque, etc, to advise her husband and remind him of Allah, and encourage him by telling him that whoever gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with something better.",Shaykh Dr. Khaalid al-Mushayqih

Allah decreed that I should conceive a sixth child, but I took some pills to abort it, approximately one and a half months after conception, and it was aborted. Now I greatly regret what I did. What should I do? Do I have to offer any expiation?.","If the pregnancy is still forty days or less, and if aborting it will serve a Shar`i interest or ward off some harm that may affect the mother, it is permissible to abort it. No expiation is required because expiation is only required for abortion of a foetus into whom the soul has been breathed.","Is early abortion allowed in Islam?


Any expiation for early abortion?","Praise be to Allah.Is early abortion allowed in Islam?
“The basic principle is that it is not permissible to abort a woman’s pregnancy at any stage except for a legitimate Shar`i reason. If the pregnancy is still a Nutfah (drop), i.e., forty days or less, and if aborting it will serve a Shar`i interest or ward off some harm that may affect the mother, it is permissible to abort it in this case . That does not include fears of hardship incurred by raising children or not being able to pay their expenses or to educate them , or being content with a certain number of children, or other excuses that are not acceptable according to Shari`ah. 
But if the pregnancy has lasted for more than forty days, it is prohibited to abort it , because after forty days it becomes an `Alaqah (clot) which is the beginning of a person. 
It is not permissible to abort it after it reaches this stage , unless a trustworthy council of doctors agrees that continuing the pregnancy poses a threat to the life of the mother, and there is the fear that she may die if the pregnancy continues. 
Therefore, your aborting the pregnancy after one and a half months on the basis of your own justification means that you committed a forbidden action, so you have to repent sincerely from that and not do such a thing again in the future.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 21/450) 
Any expiation for early abortion?
With regard to expiation, no expiation is required of you, because expiation is only required for abortion of a foetus into whom the soul has been breathed , which is after one hundred and twenty days have passed since conception. 
 It says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (21/434): 
“If the soul had been breathed into the foetus that was aborted, i.e., four or more months had passed, then expiation must be offered, which is to free a believing slave; if that is not possible then you have to fast for two consecutive months. If the soul had not yet been breathed into the foetus then it was a sin to abort the foetus, but no expiation is required. Rather what is required is repentance and praying for forgiveness.”

11878,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11878,A pregnant woman feels nauseous all the time – how should she pray?,"I have a few questions regarding pregnancy and prayers . When a woman is pregnant, especially in the early stages, it is quite common to feel ill.  I am in the first months of my pregnancy and have nausea all day long.  What is the ruling on a woman praying when she feels ill?  Can she join prayers?  Can she sit down while praying (in case she feels much more nauseous when standing)?  When I currently pray standing, I must do so quickly for fear that I will become sick and this causes me to not have the proper attention in prayers.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
          it is not permissible for a Muslim to forego prayer no matter what the 
          situation. But if he is sick, then he should pray according to what 
          he is able to do. So he should pray standing up; if he cannot do that, 
          then he should pray sitting, and if he cannot do that, then on his side. 
          The evidence for that is:
1 
          – ‘Imraan ibn Husayn (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: “The 
          Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Pray standing, and 
          if you cannot, then sitting, and if you cannot, then on your side.’” 
          (narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1117)
2 – It was narrated from Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased 
          with him) that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to a sick person who 
          prayed using a pillow for rukoo’ and prostration “Pray on the ground 
          if you can, and if you cannot, then tilt your head, and make your sujood  
          lower than your rukoo’.” (Narrated by al-Bayhaqi with a strong (qawiy) 
          isnaad, 4359. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Saheeh, 323). See 
          also Question no. 7522.  
Secondly, 
          although you say that you feel nauseous during pregnancy, this should 
          not prevent you from doing the prayers; even if you feel nauseous when 
          you pray, this does not invalidate your prayers. 
Thirdly, 
          can a woman join prayers if she finds it difficult to pray each prayer 
          at its own time?
Examples 
          of difficulty include travelling, sickness, rain, mud and intense cold 
          wind.
But 
          shortening the prayers is only permitted when travelling.
This 
          woman who feels nauseous when praying will be rewarded in sha Allaah 
          for striving to pray when she is in this difficult situation. Whatever 
          she suffers of pain and exhaustion in her pregnancy will also expiate 
          for her sins, because the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No fatigue, no disease, 
          no sorrow, no sadness, no hurt, no distress befalls a Muslim, not even 
          the prick of a thorn, but Allaah expiates some of his sins for that.”

4- Why the Companion doing this?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly, what the Muslims should do is to try to have as many 
    children as they can, because this is the command of the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who said: “Marry the one who is loving 
    and fertile, for I will be proud of your great numbers before the nations.” 
    (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2050; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh 
    Abi Dawood, 1805). 

    Having more children increases the numbers of the ummah, and 
    increasing the numbers of the ummah is a source of its glory, as Allaah 
    says, reminding the Children of Israel of His blessings: 

    “and made you more numerous in man-power”

    And Shu’ayb said to his people: 

    “And remember when you were but few, and He multiplied 
    you”

    [al-A’raaf 7:86 – interpretation of the meaning]

    No one can deny that having a large number is a source of 
    pride and strength for the ummah, contrary to what those pessimists think 
    who say that large numbers causes poverty and starvation in a nation. 

    If the ummah increases in number, puts its trust in Allaah 
    and believes His promises as mentioned in the aayah,  

    “And no moving (living) creature is there on earth but its 
    provision is due from Allaah”

    for example if she is ill and cannot cope with a pregnancy every year, or 
    she is physically unfit, or there is some other reason that getting pregnant 
    every year may harm her.

    2-Her husband should give his 
    permission, because the husband has the right to have children. There must 
    also be consultation with the doctor, to find out whether these pills are 
    harmful or not. 

    If these two conditions are met, there is nothing wrong with 
    taking these pills, but that should not be on a permanent basis, because 
    that means preventing having children. 

     With regard to ‘azl (coitus interruptus), or withdrawing 
    during intercourse, the correct scholarly view is that there is nothing 
    wrong with it, because of the hadeeth of Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him): “We used to practise ‘azl at the time when the Qur’aan was being 
    revealed” – i.e., at the time of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him). If that action had been haraam, the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have forbidden it. But the 
    scholars say that one should not engage in ‘azl with a free woman except 
    with her permission, because she has the right to have children. Moreover, 
    withdrawing without her permission diminishes her pleasure, because the 
    woman’s pleasure can only be completed after ejaculation. So not asking her 
    permission causes her to lose out on pleasure and on the possibility of 
    having children. Hence we state the condition that this may only be done 
    with her permission.

     Thirdly: the reason why the Sahaabah engaged in ‘azl was 
    because they did not want the woman – especially a slave woman – to get 
    pregnant, so that they could continue to enjoy a physical relationship with 
    them and the woman would still be able to do their work. Abu Dawood narrated 
    that a man said, “O Messenger of Allaah, I have a slave woman and I engage 
    in ‘azl with her, because I do not want her to get pregnant, but I want what 
    men want. But the Jews say that ‘azl is a lesser form of infanticide.” He 
    said, “The Jews are lying. If Allaah wants to create (a child) you cannot 
    prevent that.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, Kitaab al-Nikaah, 1856; 
    classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 1903).",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
11886,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11886,Are Women Allowed to Wear Gold Rings?,"Some of the women among us are confused because of the fatwa of the scholar Muhammad Naasir al-Deen al-Albaani, the muhaddith (hadith scholar) of Syria, in his book Adaab al-Zafaaf (The Etiquettes of Marriage and Wedding) concerning the prohibition of wearing gold rings in general.
There are women who have given up wearing them, and they describe the women who do wear them as being misguided and misguiding others. 
What do you say about the wearing of gold rings in particular? We urgently need your evidence and fatwa, because the matter has gotten out of control. May Allah forgive you and increase you in abundance of knowledge.","It is permissible for women to wear various kinds of adornment, of both silver and gold, of all types, such as necklaces, rings, bracelets, bangles, and everything that is worn on the neck and elsewhere, and everything that is ordinarily worn.",,"Praise be to Allah.Women are permitted to wear gold, in the form of rings and otherwise, because of the general meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning), 
“(Like they then for Allah) a creature who is brought up in adornments (wearing silk and gold ornaments, i.e. women), and who in dispute cannot make herself clear?”  [al-Zukhruf 43:18], 
Where Allah mentions that wearing adornments is an attribute of women; this includes gold and other things. And Ahmad, Abu Dawud and al-Nasai narrated with a good chain of transmission from Amir al-Muminin ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) that “These two [gold and silk] are forbidden for the males of my ummah.” Ibn Majah added in one narration, “and permitted for the females.” 
It was narrated by Ahmad and al-Nasai, and by al-Tirmidhi who classed it as authentic, and by Abu Dawud, and by al-Hakim who classed it as authentic, and by al-Tabarani, and classed as authentic by Ibn Hazm, from Abu Musa al-Ash’ari (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“Gold and silk have been permitted for the females of my ummah, and forbidden for the males.”
It was criticized for there being a gap [in the isnad] between Sa’id ibn Abi Hind and Abu Musa, but there is no reliable evidence for that. We have mentioned above those who classed it as authentic. Even if we assume that the criticism mentioned is valid, it is still supported by other sahih hadiths, as is the well-known principle among the imams of hadith. 
This was the view of the scholars of the salaf. More than one of them narrated that there was consensus (ijma’) that it is permissible for women to wear gold. We will mention the views of some of them in order to make the matter more clear. 
Al-Jassas said in his Tafsir (vol. 3, p. 388) in his discussion of gold: “The reports narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and from the Sahabah stating that it is permitted for women are clearer and more well-known than the reports which suggest that it is not allowed. The evidence of the ayah [he is referring to the ayah which we have quoted above] also indicates that it is permissible for women. 
The practice of women wearing jewellery has been widespread from the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Companions until the present day, without anyone denouncing them for doing that. Such a widespread practice cannot be objected to on the grounds of some solitary reports.” 
Ilkiya al-Harrasi said in Tafsir al-Quran (vol. 4, p. 391), in his commentary on the verse “a creature who is brought up in adornments” [al-Zukhruf 43:18 – interpretation of the meaning]: 
“This indicates that jewellery is permissible for women. There is proven scholarly consensus (ijma’) on this point, and the reports concerning that are innumerable.” 
Al-Bayhaqi said in al-Sunan al-Kubra (vol. 4, p. 142), when he mentioned some of the hadiths which indicate that gold and silk are permissible for women, without discussing the texts in detail:
“These and similar reports indicate that it is permissible for women to adorn themselves with gold. The fact that there is consensus that this is permissible for them indicates that the reports which indicate that it is haram for women have been abrogated.” 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu’ (vol. 6, p. 40):
“The Muslims are agreed that it is permissible for women to wear various kinds of adornment, of silver, gold and silk, by consensus, because of the authentic hadiths.” 
He also said (vol. 6, p. 40):
“The Muslims are agreed that it is permissible for women to wear various kinds of adornment, of both silver and gold, of all types, such as necklaces, rings , bracelets, bangles, and everything that is worn on the neck and elsewhere, and everything that is ordinarily worn. There is no dispute on this matter at all.” 
He said in his commentary on Sahih Muslim, in the chapter on the prohibition of gold rings for men, and the abrogation of their being permissible which had existed at the beginning of Islam:
“The Muslims are agreed that gold rings are permissible for women.” 
Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on the hadith of al-Bara – “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade seven things, he forbade gold rings…” – (vol. 10, p. 317): 
“The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade gold rings, or making rings of gold, to men only , not women. It has been reported that there is scholarly consensus concerning their being permissible for women.” 
The fact that gold is permitted for women in general, whether it is formed into rings or not, is proven by the two hadith quoted above, and by the comments of the scholars mentioned above, and by the scholarly consensus that the following hadiths are to be accepted:

The hadith narrated by Abu Dawud and al-Nasai from ‘Amr ibn Shu’ayb from his father from his grandfather, that a woman came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with a daughter of hers, on whose hand were two heavy bangles of gold. He said to her, “Do you pay zakah on these?” She said, “No.” He said, “Would you be happy if Allah were to give you two bracelets of fire on the Day of Resurrection because of these?” So she took them off and threw them to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), saying, “They are for Allah and His Messenger.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained to her the obligation to pay zakah on the two bangles mentioned, but he did not rebuke her for putting them on her daughter. This indicated that that is permissible, although they were formed into the shape of circles. The hadith is sahih and its isnad is jayyid, as was pointed out by al-Hafiz in al-Bulugh. 
2 – It was narrated in Sunan Abi Dawud with a sahih isnad from ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she said: “Some jewellery came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as a gift from the Negus (the ruler of Abyssinia), as a gift to him. It included a gold ring in which was set an Abyssinian stone. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) picked it up hesitantly with a stick or with his fingers, then he called Umamah the daughter of Abu’l-‘As and his daughter Zaynab. He said, ‘Adorn yourself with this, O my daughter.’” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave a ring to Umamah, which was formed from a circle of gold, and said, “Adorn yourself with this.” This indicates that gold formed into a circle is permissible on the basis of this report. 

Abu Dawud and al-Daraqutni narrated, and al-Hakim classed as sahih, as stated in Bulugh al-Maram, a report from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she used to wear anklets of gold. She said, “O Messenger of Allah, is this kanz (stored wealth)?” He said, “If you pay the zakah on it, it is not kanz.” 
With regard to the hadiths which appear to forbid women wearing gold, they are shadhdh (“odd”), and contradict those which are more sahih and stronger. The imams of hadith have stated that what is said in the hadiths with jayyid isnads but goes against hadiths which are more sahih, and they cannot be reconciled, and the chronology is not known, such reports are to be regarded as shadhdh (“odd”) and unreliable, and they are not to be followed. Al-Hafiz al-'Iraqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Alfiyyah: 
“An odd report is one in which a trustworthy person says something which goes against the majority.  
Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said in al-Nukhbah: 
“If it is contradicted by something that is more correct, then the correct report should be adopted and the one that contradicts it is odd.” 
They also stated that the condition for a sahih hadith to be accepted is that it should not be shadhdh (odd). There is no doubt that the hadiths which state that gold is haram for women, even if we accept that their isnads are free of faults, cannot be reconciled with the sahih hadiths which indicate that gold is permissible for females, when we do not know which reports came first. So they have to be regarded as shadhdh and not sahih, following this shar’i principle which is accepted by the scholars. What our brother ‘Allamah Shaykh Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani has mentioned in his book Adab al-Zafaf, reconciling these reports with the hadiths which permit (gold to women) by interpreting the prohibition as applying to gold formed into circles and the permission as applying to other kinds of jewellery, is not correct and is not in accordance with the hadiths which indicate that gold is permitted, because the hadiths permit rings , which are in the form of a circle, and they permit bangles, which are in the form of a circle. So what we have mentioned becomes clear. Moreover the hadiths which indicate that gold is permitted are general and are not restricted in meaning. So we must follow them because they are general in meaning and because their isnads are sahih. This is supported by the reports narrated by a group of the scholars that there was consensus that the hadiths which indicate that gold is forbidden were abrogated, as we have quoted from them above. This is the truth beyond a doubt. Hence confusion may be dispelled and the ruling of shari’ah becomes clear: there is no doubt that gold is permitted to the females of this ummah and is forbidden to the males. And Allah is the Source of strength. Praise be to Allah the Lord of the Worlds, and may Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions.

11890,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11890,Ruling on Muslims visiting the graves of kaafirs,What is the ruling on a Muslim visiting the graves of kaafirs?,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is permissible to visit the graves of those who did not die in Islam in order only to learn a lesson from that. 
This is because of the report of Abu Hurayrah, who said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) visited the grave of his mother, and he wept and those who were with him wept. Then he said, ‘I asked my Lord for permission to pray for forgiveness for her, and He did not grant me permission to do that, and I asked Him for permission to visit her grave, and He gave me permission. So visit the graves, for they are a reminder of death.’”
(Narrated by Muslim, 3/65; Abu Dawood, 2/72; al-Nasaa’i, 1/286; also by Ibn Maajah, al-Haakim, al-Bayhaqi and Ahmad) 
Buraydah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated: “We were with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on a journey (according to one report, on the campaign of the conquest [of Makkah]), and he camped with us, and we were nearly one thousand on mounts. He prayed two rak’ahs, then he turned to us weeping. ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) got up and went to him, and said, ‘May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah, what is the matter?’ He said, ‘I asked my Lord to let me pray for forgiveness for my mother, and He did not give me permission, and my eyes filled with tears out of compassion for her in the Fire. I asked my Lord for permission to visit her grave, and He granted me permission. I used to forbid you to visit the graves, but (now) visit them, for visiting them will increase you in good.’”
(Narrated by Ahmad, 5/355-359; Ibn Abi Shaybah, 4/139; also narrated by Ibn Hibbaan and al-Haakim. The other addition was narrated by al-Haakim who said, it is saheeh according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs [al-Bukhaari and Muslim], and al-Dhahabi agreed with him, and it is as they said. A briefer version was narrated by al-Tirmidhi, who classed it as saheeh).  
If a Muslim visits the grave of a kaafir, he does not greet h m with salaams or make du’aa’ for him; rather he should give him the tidings of Hell. 
The evidence for that is the hadeeth of Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqaas who said: “A Bedouin came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, ‘My father used to uphold the ties of kinship, and so on and so forth  - where is he now?’ He said, ‘In Hell.’ The Bedouin got upset and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, where is your father?’ He said, ‘Whenever you pass by the grave of a kaafir, give him the tidings of Hell.’ The Bedouin later became a Muslim, and he said, ‘The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave me a difficult commission. Whenever I pass by the grave of a kaafir, I give him the tidings of Hell.”’”
(Narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Mu’jam al-Kabeer, 1/191; Ibn al-Sunni in ‘Aml al-Yawm wa’l-Laylah, 588; al-Diyaa’ al-Maqdisi in al-Ahaadeeth al-Mukhtaarah, with a saheeh isnaad. Al-Haythami (1/117-118) said: it was narrated by al-Bazzaar and by al-Tabaraani in al-Kabeer, and the men of its isnaad are sound). 
And Abu Hurayrah narrated in a marfoo’ hadeeth [i.e., it is attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)]: “When you pass by the graves of the people of the jaahilyyah, of our people and your people, give them the news that they are among the people of Hell.” (Narrated by Ibn al-Sunni in al-Yawm wa’l-Laylah with an isnaad which includes Yahyaa ibn Yamaan, who had a bad memory, from Muhammad ibn ‘Umar. I do not know it from Abu Salamah from him, but apparently he is Ibn ‘Amr, who is hasan in narrating hadeeth. And Allah knows best.”",Adapted from Mukhtasar Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz by al-Albaani
