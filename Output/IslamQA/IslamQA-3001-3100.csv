3001,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3001,"Are sperm alive or
    do they have no soul?","If the soul is breathed into the embryo
      after four months, are we to understand that the sperm which joins with the woman’s
      egg, from which the embryo is formed, has no soul, or what?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Both the sperm and the ovum are alive in a sense which, if they are
    free from defects, prepares each of them to join with the other, if Allaah wills and
    decrees it to happen. When that happens, if Allaah wills it, the embryo is formed and is
    also alive in a manner that suits it and prepares it to grow and develop, moving through
    the known stages. When the soul is breathed into it, it becomes alive in another sense, by
    the permission of Allaah, the Subtle One, the Aware. No matter how a man tries, even if he
    is a highly-skilled doctor, he can never comprehend all the secrets and stages of
    development of pregnancy. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“Allaah knows what every female bears, and by how much the
    wombs fall short (of their time or number) or exceed. Everything with Him is in (due)
    proportion. All-Knower of the unseen and the seen, the Most Great, the Most High.”
    [al-Ra’d 13:8-9]
“Verily, Allaah! With Him (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour, He
    sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs…” [Luqmaan 31:34]
(Fataawa Islamiyyah li’l-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 488).
Life is of varying kinds, and each being is alive in a
    manner that suits it by the power of Allaah. So plants are alive in a manner that suits
    them, sperm is alive in a manner that suits it, and man is alive in a manner that suits
    him, and so on. Allaah is the Creator of all this, and He has made water the basis of
    every living thing, as He says in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning):
“Have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and the
    earth were joined together as one united piece, then We parted them? And We have made from
    water every living thing. Will they not then believe?” [al-Anbiya’ 21:30]

It is not permissible for anyone who receives a letter in which Allah is mentioned or an aayah of the Qur’aan is quoted to throw it into the garbage or put it in any undesirable place. The same applies to newspapers and other similar papers: it is not permitted to mishandle them or throw them in the garbage, or to use them to wrap food or other things, because the name of Allah is mentioned in them.

      razors to sell. Given that these razors are usually used for shaving
      beards, and rarely for shaving moustaches and pubic hairs, and for this
      reason I feel doubtful, is it halaal or haraam, i.e., should I sell them
      or not?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It

3004,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3004,Opening      a store to sell reptiles and predatory animals,"I want to ask a question about the Islamic ruling on dealing in and buying animals for hobby purposes or for decorative purposes. These include the following, which is not a comprehensive list Decorative birds such as parrots and other colourful birds Reptiles such as snakes and lizards Predators such as wolves, lions, foxes, etc. -- where these animals are kept for their beautiful appearance or used for their fur. It is known that they are expensive and will be kept behind bars, but dealing in them is very profitable.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: selling decorative birds like parrots, colourful birds and nightingales for their voices is permissible, because looking at them and listening to them is something that is permissible. There is no text in the sharee’ah which forbids selling them or collecting them; however there are texts which may be understood as meaning that it is permissible to keep them in cages, so long as they are fed and watered and given whatever care is needed. Among these texts is the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari from Anas, who said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was the best of people in attitude. I had a brother called Abu ‘Umayr, who had just been weaned, I think. When (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) came, he would say, ‘O Abu ‘Umayr, what happened to the nughayr?’ – a nughar [young sparrow or small bird] with which he used to play.” This nughar is a type of bird. Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said in his commentary (Fath al-Baari), when enumerating the things that we learn from this hadeeth: “… it is permissible for children to play with birds; it is permissible for parents to allow their children to play with things with which it is permissible to play; it is permissible to spend money on permissible things to entertain children; it is permissible to keep a bird in a cage or to clip a birds’ wings – for one or the other must have been the case with Abu ‘Umayr’s bird, and whichever one it was, the other is also implied in the ruling.
There is also the hadeeth narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), in which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A woman entered Hell because of a cat which she detained but she did not give it food or water, and she did not let it free so that it could eat of the vermin of the earth.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari in al-Saheeh, 4/100,152; Ahmad, 2/261). If this is permissible in the case of cats, then it is also permissible in the case of birds etc.
Some scholars believed it to be makrooh to keep them in cages. Some believed that it was not allowed, and said: because people do not need to listen to their voices and look at them. This is an unnecessary luxury and soft living, and it is also foolishness because it means that one is enjoying the voice of a creature that is calling out in longing to be allowed to fly and grieving that it cannot fly freely in the open air – as was stated in the book Al-Furoo’ wa Tasheehuh by al-Mirdaawi, 4/9, and al-Insaaf, 4/275.
Secondly: among the conditions of valid sales is that the thing to be sold is something which it is permissible to use and benefit from, even if there is no necessity as such. There is no benefit in snakes, which are indeed harmful, so it is not permissible to buy or sell them. The same applies to lizards – there is no benefit in them, so it is not permissible to sell or buy them.
Thirdly: it is not permissible to sell predators such as wolves, lions, foxes or any other fanged carnivore, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade that, and because it is a waste of money, which was also forbidden by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).","From Fataawaa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 13/38"
3005,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3005,Is It Prohibited to Burn Insects?,"Is it permissible to kill insects that may be found in the house, such as ants, cockroaches and the like, by burning them? If it is not permissible, what should we do?","1.	If ants or cockroaches or dung-beetles cause harm, they may be killed with insecticides but not with fire. 
2.	The Prophet told us that rats, scorpions, crows, kites [a hawk-like bird], and mad dogs are harmful pests, and he told us to kill them whether we are in Ihram or not.",,"Praise be to Allah.If these insects are harmful, they may be killed with insecticides, but not with fire. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are five pests that may be killed whether one is in Ihram or not: rats, scorpions, crows, kites [a hawk-like bird], and mad dogs.” (Reported by Muslim, 2071) Another report adds a sixth, snakes. 
Thus the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us that they are harmful pests, and that they are unlike other animals which do not do harm, and so he told us to kill them whether we are in Ihram or not. 
If other creatures, such as ants or cockroaches or dung-beetles, cause harm, they may also be killed with insecticides, but not with fire.

3006,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3006,"Ruling on
    illegitimate children","Can an illegitimate person enter
      Paradise if he obeys Allaah? Is there any sin on him or not?",,,"Praise be to Allah.An illegitimate child does not bear any sin because of
    his parents’ having committed the sin of zinaa (unlawful sexual intercourse), because
    that was not of his doing. They bear their own sin, because Allaah says (interpretation of
    the meanings): 
    “… He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and
    he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned…” [al-Baqarah 2:286]
“… no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of
    another…” [al-An’aam 6:164]
With regard to his ultimate destiny, the illegitimate person is like
    anyone else: if he obeys Allaah and does righteous deeds, and dies as a Muslim, then
    Paradise will be his; if he disobeys Allaah and dies as a kaafir, then he will be one of
    the people of Hell. If he mixes righteous deeds and bad deeds, and dies as a Muslim, then
    his fate is up to Allaah: if He wills, He will forgive him, if He wills, He will punish
    him, and his eventual admission to Paradise will be by the Grace and Mercy of Allaah. As
    for the hadeeth which says that an illegitimate person will not enter Paradise, this is a
    fabrication (falsely attributed to the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him)). And Allaah knows best.","Fataawa Islamiyyah li’l-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 522"

3009,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3009,Are Prayer Beads Allowed in Islam?,What is the ruling on using prayer beads?,"Some scholars say that it is permissible to use prayer beads (Masbahah ), but they say that it is preferable to do Tasbih (count praises) on one’s fingers; others say that it is Bid`ah (reprehensible religious innovation).",,"Praise be to Allah.Some scholars say that it is permissible to use the Masbahah (prayer beads), but they say that it is preferable to do Tasbih (count praises) on one’s fingers; others say that it is Bid`ah (reprehensible religious innovation).
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Fatawa (22/187): 
“Some of them might show off by putting their prayer-mats over their shoulders and carrying their Masbahah in their hands, making them symbols of religion and prayer. It is known from the Mutawatir reports (reports in such large numbers that they couldn’t be forged) that neither the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) nor his Companions used these as symbols. They used to recite Tasbih and count on their fingers, as the Hadith says: “Count on your fingers, for they will be asked, and will be made to speak.” Some of them may count their Tasbih with pebbles or date stones. Some people say that doing Tasbih with the Masbahah is disliked, and some allow it, but no one says that Tasbih with the Masbahah is better than Tasbih with the fingers.” Then he (may Allah have mercy on him) goes on to discuss the issue of showing off with the Masbahah, saying that it is showing off with regard to something that is not prescribed by Islam, which is worse than showing off with regard to something that is prescribed.”
Al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked  (al-Al-Liqa al-Al-MaftoohMaftuh, 3/30) whether using the Masbahah for Tasbih is Bid`ah, and his reply was: 
“It is better not to do Tasbih with the Masbahah, but it is not Bid`ah , because there is a basis for it, which is the fact that some of the Sahabah (Companions) did Tasbih with pebbles. But the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us that Tasbih with the fingers is better, as he said, `Count with the fingertips, for they will be made to speak.’ Doing Tasbih with the Masbahah is not haram (impermissible) or Bid`ah, but it is better not to do it, because the one who does Tasbih with the Masbahah has shunned something better. Using the Masbahah may also be contaminated with some element of showing off, because we see some people carrying Masbahah that contain a thousand beads, as if they are telling people, `Look at me, I do a thousand Tasbihs!’ Secondly, those who use the Masbahah for Tasbih are usually absent-minded and not focused, so you see them doing Tasbih with the beads, but their gaze is wandering all over the place, which indicates that they are not really concentrating. It is better to do Tasbih with one’s fingers, preferably using the right hand rather than the left, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to count his Tasbih on his right hand. If a person counts his Tasbih using both hands, there is nothing wrong with that, but it is better to use the right hand only.”
Ash-Shaykh Muhammad Nasir Al-Din Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said in As-Silsilah Ad-Da`ifah (1/110), where he quotes the (inauthentic) Hadith “What a good reminder is the Subhah [Masbahah],”
“In my view, the meaning of this Hadith is invalid for a number of reasons:

Firstly, the Subhah [Masbahah] is Bid`ah and was not known at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It happened after that, so how could he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) have encouraged his Sahabah to do something that was unknown to them? The evidence for what I have said is the report narrated by Ibn Waddah in Al-Bid’ wa’l-Nahy `anha from Al-Salt ibn Bahram, who said: `Ibn Mas’ood passed by a woman who had a [Masbahah] with which she was making Tasbih, and he broke it and threw it aside, then he passed by a man who was making Tasbih with pebbles, and he kicked him then said, “You think you are better than the Sahabah, but you are following unjustified Bid`ah! You think you have more knowledge than the Companions of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)!”’ Its chain of narrators is authentic to As-Salt, who is one of the trustworthy followers of the Tabi`in.
Secondly, it goes against the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). `Abdulah ibn `Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) said, `I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) counting the Tasbih on his right hand.’”

He also said (1/117): 
“If there is only one bad thing about the Masbahah, which is that it takes the place of the Sunnah of counting on the fingers, even though all agree that counting on the fingers is preferable, then that is bad enough. How rarely I see people counting their Tasbih on their fingers!
Moreover, people have invented so many sophisticated ways of following this Bid`ah, so you see the followers of one of the [Sufi] Tariqahs (orders) wearing the Masbahah around their necks ! Or some of them counting with the beads whilst talking or listening to you! Or another one – the like of whom I have not seen for some time – riding his bicycle through a street crowded with people, with the Masbahah in one of his hands! They are showing the people that they are not distracted from the remembrance of Allah for even an instant, but in many cases this Bid`ah is a cause of their neglecting what is obligatory. It has happened many times – to others as well as myself – that when I greet one of these people with Salam, they answer only by waving and not by saying the words of the greeting. The bad results of this Bid`ah are innumerable, and no one can say it better than the poet:
`All goodness is in following that which went before (the Salaf)
All badness is in the innovations of those who came later.’”

From the hadith quoted above it seems like it is permissible to sell it or to give it to non-Muslims.",,,"Praise be to Allah. We constantly advise people, when reading texts that appear to present a problem, to examine all versions and isnaads of these ahaadeeth, and to refer to the words of scholars and commentators, because they have the knowledge and understanding that can dispel the confusion.  In the following discussion we will quote several versions of the hadeeth as reported by al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him), then we will give a summary from the commentary on the hadeeth by al-Haafiz Ahmad ibn ‘Ali ibn Hajar al-‘Asqallaani (may Allah have mercy on him) from his book Fath al-Baari Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhaari, and from the commentary of Imam al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) on the same hadeeth in Saheeh Muslim.  
‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar reported that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab saw a hullah siyara’ [a type of two-piece garment] at the door of the mosque and said, “O Messenger of Allah, why don’t you buy this and wear it on Fridays and when the delegations come to you?”  The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “This is only worn by one who has no share in the Hereafter.” Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was brought a number of garments [hullahs] of the same type. He gave one of them to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) and ‘Umar said, “O Messenger of Allah, are you giving it to me to wear it when you said what you said about the hullah of ‘Utaarid (the vendor of the first hullah)?”  The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I am not giving it to you to wear it.”  So ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) gave it to a brother of his in Makkah who was a mushrik.”  (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 837). 
According to another report: “[The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:] Sell it and benefit from its price.” Al-Bukhaari, 896.
 According to another report: “I did not send it to you for you to wear it, for it is worn only by one who has no share in the Hereafter. I sent it to you so that you could benefit from it – i.e., by selling it.”  Al-Bukhaari, 1962. 
According to another report: “Umar said: ‘How can I wear it when you said what you said about it?’   He said, ‘I did not give it to you for you to wear it; sell it or give it to someone else.’  So ‘Umar sent it to a brother of his among the people of Makkah, before he [the brother] became Muslim.”  Al-Bukhaari, 2426.
 According to another report: “He said: ‘Sell it and spend the money on your own needs.’”  Al-Bukhaari, 2826. 
According to another report: “He said: ‘I sent it to you so that you could make some money from it.’”  Al-Bukhaari, 5617.
 Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Concerning the phrase, ‘Why don’t you buy it and wear it?’ – it is as if ‘Umar wanted the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to buy it and wished that he would do so. ‘This is only worn’ – according to the report of Jareer ibn Haazim, he said, ‘silk is only worn’.  ‘One who has no share’ – Maalik added in his report, ‘in the Hereafter.’  This could mean the one who has no share in the Hereafter, i.e., of silk clothes. 
‘He gave it to him’ – it is apparent from the rest of the hadeeth that he did not give it to him to wear, or it could mean that he gave him something that could be used for clothing. [The verb used, kasaa, has the sense of covering or clothing].  According to the report of Maalik, ‘Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was brought a number of similar hullahs, and he gave one to ‘Umar.’ In another report, ‘Later on some hullahs (of the same type) were brought to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he sent one to ‘Umar and one to Usaamah ibn Zayd, and gave one to ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib.’
 ‘Sell it and spend the money on your own needs’ – means benefit from its price, or it could mean trade it or exchange it, or some more general meaning. 
(Note): the reason why this hadeeth was included in Baab al-Hareer li’l-nisa’ (Chapter on silk for women) is because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to ‘Umar, ‘sell it or use it for clothing.’ Silk is forbidden for men, and there is no difference between ‘Umar and other men in that regard, so the permission to give it to someone else to wear applies only if it is given to a woman.  The fact that ‘Umar gave it to his brother should not be a source of confusion to those who believe that the minor issues of sharee’ah apply to kaafirs too, as ‘Umar gave it to his brother to sell it or to give it to a woman to wear.
 In some versions of the hadeeth… Ibn ‘Umar said: ‘The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw ‘Utaarid wearing a silk garment and he disliked that for him, then he gave ‘Umar a similar garment…’  and ‘… [he said,] “I did not give it to you to wear it, I gave it to you to give to women to wear.”’  This is an indication that it is permissible for women to wear pure silk.  
Imaam Muslim (may Allah have mercy on him) reported in his Saheeh that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ‘The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) one day wore a coat of silk brocade that had been given to him, but soon afterwards he took it off and sent it to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab.  It was said to him, “But you took it off so quickly, O Messenger of Allah.” He said, “Jibreel forbade me to wear it.”  Then ‘Umar came to him, weeping, and said, “O Messenger of Allah, you disliked something and gave it to me. What is wrong with me?”  He said, “I did not give it to you to wear it, I gave it to you to sell it.” So he sold it for two thousand dirhams.’  (Reported by Muslim, 3861).” 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on Saheeh Muslim:
 “In the hadeeth of ‘Umar about this hullah there is evidence that silk is forbidden for men and permitted for women, that it is permissible to give it, that its price is permitted, and that a Muslim is permitted to give a kaafir clothes and other things.
 ‘So ‘Umar gave it to a mushrik brother of his in Makkah’ – this is how it was reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. According to a report narrated by al-Bukhaari in some chapter, ‘‘Umar sent it to a brother of his among the people of Makkah, before he [the brother] became Muslim’ – this indicates that he (the brother) subsequently became Muslim… This also indicates that it is permissible to maintain family ties with kaafirs and to treat them well, and that it is permissible to give gifts to kaafirs.  The permission to give silk clothes to men does not mean that they should wear them. Some may misinterpret this to mean that kaafir men are permitted to wear silk, but this is incorrect. The hadeeth describes giving a gift to a kaafir, but does not give them permission to wear silk.  The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent silk garments to ‘Umar, ‘Ali and Usaamah (may Allah be pleased with them), but this does not mean that they were permitted to wear silk; he stated quite clearly that he was giving it to them so that they could benefit from it in some way other than by wearing it.  The correct opinion, which is that of the majority of scholars, is that the minor issues of sharee’ah apply equally to kaafirs, so they are forbidden to wear silk just as Muslims are. And Allah knows best.
 Al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him) reported another hadeeth on the same issue from al-Miswar ibn Makhramah, who said that his father Makhramah said to him: ‘O my son, I have heard that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has received some coats and he is sharing them out, so let us go to him.’  So we went and found the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in his house. [My father] said to me, ‘O my son, call the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for me.’ I felt too embarrassed, so I said, ‘Should I call the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for you?’ He said, ‘O my son, he is not arrogant.’ So I called him, and he came out carrying a coat of silk brocade with gold buttons. He said, ‘O Makhramah, we kept this for you,’ and he gave it to him. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Kitaab al-Libaas, Baab al-Muzarrar bi’l-Dhahab).
 Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on the hadeeth:
 “ ‘He came out carrying a coat of silk brocade with gold buttons’ – it is possible that this happened before silk was prohibited, but after silk and gold were prohibited for men, this report can no longer be used as evidence by those who want to permit these things.  It is also possible that this happened after these things were prohibited, in which case the garment was given so that the recipient could benefit from it either by selling it or by giving it to women to wear.”
 In brief, then, the answer to the matter raised in the question is that so long as a silk garment has some legitimate use, such as clothing for women, then it is permissible to sell it and take the money paid for it.  And Allah knows best. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

How can you seek repentance from zina?","Praise be to Allah.What is Zina? 
Zina, in Arabic, means immorality, and is used with two meanings in Shari`ah: a general meaning and a specific meaning.
The general meaning includes that which carries the punishment (hadd) and that which does not carry it. Islam does not give the name of Zina only to that which carries the punishment, which is just one of many types of Zina. 
Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: I have never heard any better definition of small faults [al-Najm 53:32] than that which Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): Allah has decreed for every son of Adam his share of Zina, and there is no way to escape from it. The Zina of the eye is a glance, the Zina of the tongue is speaking, and the Zina of the mind is wishing and hoping; then the private part either acts upon this or it does not. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 11/26; Muslim, 4/2046).
Al-Bukhari included this hadeeth in a chapter entitled Bab Zina al-jawarih doon al-farj (Chapter on the Zina of faculties other than the private part).
Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Zina is not always associated with the private part itself, but may involve other faculties such as the eyes and so on. Ibn Battal (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Looking and speaking are called Zina because they lead to real Zina. This is why he said that the private part either acts upon this or it does not
Zina: A Grave sin in Islam
Zina is one of the forbidden deeds, one of the most serious major sins (kabair) after shirk and murder. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“And those who invoke not any other god along with Allah, nor kill such life as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment. The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace; except those who repent and believe and do righteous deeds, for those Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [al-Furqan 25:68-70]
“And come not near to unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a fahishah [anything that transgresses its limits a great sin], and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allaah forgives him).” [al-Isra 17:32]
Imam al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars said that the phrase ‘And come not near to unlawful sexual intercourse’ is more eloquent than merely saying Do not commit Zina, because the meaning is, Do not even come close to Zina. This means not doing any deed that may get close to Zina or lead to it, such as being alone with a member of the opposite sex, touching, looking, going to evil places, speaking in a haraam manner to a woman to whom one is not related, thinking about and planning immoral acts, and so on.
Abd-Allah ibn Masood said: I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), Which sin is worst in the sight of Allah? He said, To make any rival to Allah, when He has created you. I asked, Then what? He said, To kill your child for fear that he will eat with you. I asked, Then what? He said, To commit Zina with the wife of your neighbour. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 8/492; Muslim, 1/90).
All religions are agreed that Zina is haram; no religion allows it. The punishment for Zina is the most severe of punishments, because it violates peoples’ honour and lineages.
Degrees of zina
The sin of Zina may be of varying degrees, and the gravity of the offence depends on the nature and circumstances of the deed, although all Zina is haram, a major sin and an act of immorality. Zina with a mahram [i.e., incest] (Allah forbid) or with a married woman is far worse than Zina with a woman to whom one is not related or with an unmarried woman, because it involves violating the rights of the husband, contaminating his bed, attributing a child to him that is not his, and other kinds of offence and harm. 
If her husband is a neighbour, the crime of being a bad neighbour is added to the offence. If her husband is one's brother or relative, the crime of breaking family ties is added. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: He will not enter Paradise whose neighbour is not safe from his evil actions. (Reported by Muslim, 1/68). 
There is no evil action worse than Zina, and if the husband is absent for the sake of Allah, such as in worship, seeking knowledge or jihaad, then the sin is compounded. Buraydah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The wives of the mujahideen are as sacred and forbidden to those who stay behind as their own mothers. There is no man of those who stay behind who is entrusted by one of the mujahideen with the care of his family and then betrays him (by committing Zina), but he will be detained on the Day of Resurrection, and (the one whom he betrayed) will take as much of his good deeds as he wishes. So what do you think? (Reported by Muslim, 3515)
Punishment for zina
If the adulterer is married, the sin is greater, and the punishment is stoning, and if he is an old man, the sin is greater and the punishment is as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) mentioned in the hadeeth about the three whom Allah will neither look at nor praise on the Day of Resurrection, and who will have a painful punishment. (Saheeh Muslim, 156)
If the deed is also committed during a sacred month or in a sacred place or at a time which is special in the sight of Allah, the sin is compounded.
What constitutes zina?
The jurists (may Allah have mercy on them) stated that the basic act of Zina which carries the punishment is illegal sexual intercourse, whereby the two circumcised parts [i.e. genitals] come together and there is penetration of the tip of the penis, because this is actual penetration (which carries the prescribed hadd or punishment).
What leads to zina?
A person must avoid evil deeds and everything that can lead to them. Allah has commanded us to avoid the traps of the Shaytaan, because if a man takes one step in that direction, his shaytan and his own ego (nafs) will keep urging him to do evil until he commits immoral deeds.
One should think about how serious it is to touch a woman to whom one is not related, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained: If one of you were to be stabbed in the head with a piece of iron it would be better for him than if he were to touch a woman whom it is not permissible for him to touch. (Reported by al-Tabaraani; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, 5045). 
This refers to the punishment for touching, so how about worse deeds, such as embracing and kissing, and even worse kinds of illicit activity? The Muslim judge is empowered to stipulate an appropriate punishment for every proven action other than actual intercourse; in the case of intercourse, the punishment set out by Islam is one hundred lashes and a year’s exile for one who is unmarried, and stoning for one who is married. This is the punishment in this world, and the punishment in the Hereafter is far more severe.
Will adulterers be forgiven?
One of the important principles which the salaf (may Allah have mercy on them) pointed out is that the sincere believer who truly hopes for Allaah and the Hereafter should not look at whether the sin is major or minor, or whether is carries a punishment (hadd) or not. Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: There is no major sin if one asks for forgiveness, and there is no minor sin if one persists in repeating it. Someone else said: If you want to disobey Allah, do not think about the smallness of the sin, think about the greatness of the One Whom you are disobeying.
How can you seek repentance from zina?
With regard to the matter of repentance from Zina , please refer to the book ""I Want to Repent, But..."" May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

3020,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3020,Is It Prohibited to Eat with the Left Hand?,"Because of my nephew’s bad habit he has great difficulty in eating with his right hand. At the moment, he uses his left hand when there is nobody to remind him. I am worried about this, so, what is the Fiqhi ruling concerning a person who gets used to eating with his left hand?","Prophet Muhammad said: “When any one of you eats, let him eat with his right hand, and when he drinks, let him drink with his right hand, because the devil eats with his left hand and drinks with his left hand.” Therefore, the one who uses his left hand to eat and drink should be taught the Islamic ruling and should be reminded of this Hadith.",,"Praise be to Allah.Doing good is a habit and doing evil is a habit. Man is always either making progress or falling behind. When a person gets used to doing something, he becomes very fond of it and loves it, and dislikes anything else. Then he thinks that the thing he is not used to is not possible, but this way of thinking is not right and it goes against both the laws of Islam and the facts of reality. 
Therefore, the one who uses his left hand to eat and drink should be taught the Islamic ruling and should be reminded of the Hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on this matter. When a man ate with his left hand in his presence, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, Eat with your right hand. He said, I cannot. He said, May you never be able to! Nothing was stopping him but his stubborn arrogance, and he never raised his right hand to his mouth after that. (Narrated by Muslim, 3776).
According to a report narrated by Ad-Darimi, his right hand never reached his mouth. This man suffered paralysis because of the Du`a of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“In this Hadith, we have an indication that it is allowed to pray against a person who breaks a Shar`i rule with no excuse. We also see the principle of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil in all situations, even with regard to eating . It encourages us to teach proper manners of eating to a person who is eating if he is doing something wrong. The Hadith also teaches us that the devil eats with his left hand, because of the Hadith: When any one of you eats, let him eat with his right hand , and when he drinks, let him drink with his right hand, because the devil eats with his left hand and drinks with his left hand. (Narrated by Muslim, 3764)
The devil eats with his left hand so the person who eats with his left hand resembles the devil, indeed the devil is sharing his food with him. Ahmad reported with a sound Isnad (chain of narration) from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) and attributed it to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): Whoever eats with his left hand, the devil eats with him. (Tuhfat Al-Ahwadhi, commentary on Hadith 1721)
Moreover, the left hand should be reserved for removing dirt, as when cleaning oneself after going to the toilet (Istinja’) and blowing one's nose and other kinds of cleaning oneself and removing dirt. How can a person use that which is used for removing dirt and impurities for putting food in his mouth?
Hafsah (may Allah be pleased with her), the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to use his right hand for eating, drinking and getting dressed and his left hand for everything else. (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 30)
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“This is a fixed rule in Shari`ah. It has to do with honourable things such as putting on ones shirt, trousers and shoes, entering the mosque, using Siwak , applying kohl, combing and styling ones hair, shaving the head, giving Salam at the end of prayer, washing oneself in Ghusl or Wudu, leaving the toilet, eating, drinking, shaking hands , acknowledging the Black Stone, and other things where we are encouraged to use the right hand or start with the right. As for the opposite [things that are not honourable], such as entering the toilet , leaving the mosque, blowing one's nose, washing oneself after using the toilet, taking off one's shirt, trousers and shoes, and so on, then we should start with the left or use the left hand. All of this has to do with honouring the right hand or right side.
Some people may have a real problem that prevents them from using their right hand, such as being paralyzed and so on. In this case they are excused and there is no blame on them. An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If he has an excuse for not eating and drinking with his right hand, such as sickness or an injury, then this is not disliked.
Most likely the problem of the boy you are asking about has to do with habit, so try to get him used to eating with his right hand and keep on advising him and reminding him to do so. You could seek the help of psychiatrists, because some of them may have some useful ideas. We ask Allah to give you strength, May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

I'm very sorry if my question is being offensive to individual or JAMAH TABLIGH.",,,"Praise be to Allah.No doubt the cause of this problem and others is ignorance of many of the rulings of Islam, and a lack of understanding of a man’s responsibilities towards those whom he is supporting, and the duties towards his family that Allaah has enjoined upon him.
One of the greatest rights enjoined by wives in children is that the head of the family should spend on them; indeed, this is one of the greatest acts of worship and devotion to Allaah that a person can do. Spending on them covers their food, drink, clothing and shelter, and everything that a wife and children need to ensure their good health and physical well being.
Allaah has told us that men are the ones who spend on women, and so they have the status of being qawwaamoon (maintainers and protectors) and of excelling over them, because they spend on them when they give them the mahr (dowry) and maintenance. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means…”[al-Nisa’ 4:34]
The fact that this spending is obligatory is indicated by the Qur’an, the Sunnah and the consensus of the scholars and of all wise people.
The evidence of the Qur’aan includes the aayat (interpretation of the meanings):
“Let the rich man spend according to his means, and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allaah has given him. Allaah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him. Allaah will grant after hardship, ease.”[al-Talaaq 65:7]
“… but the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother’s food and clothing on a reasonable basis. No person shall have a burden laid on him greater than he can bear…”[al-Baqarah 2:233]
“… and if they are pregnant, spend on them until they deliver…”
[al-Talaaq 65:6]
With regard to the evidence in the Sunnah, many ahaadeeth were narrated which show that it is obligatory for the husband to spend on his wife and children, and those who are under his guardianship. Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with them both) reported that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said in his sermon during his Farewell Pilgrimage:
“Fear Allaah with regard to women, for they are your prisoners. You have taken them as a trust from Allaah, and they are permissible for you through the word of Allaah, and they have the right to be given provision and clothing by you on a reasonable basis.” (Reported by Muslim, 8/183).
‘Umar ibn al-Ahwas (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that he heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say during his Farewell Pilgrimage:
“Verily, you have rights over your women, and your women have rights over you. As for your rights over your women, they are that they should not allow anyone to sit on your beds whom you dislike, or allow anyone into your houses whom you dislike. Verily, their rights over you are that you should treat them well with regard to their clothing and food.”
(Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1163, and Ibn Maajah, 1851).
Mu’aawiyah ibn Haydah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:
“I said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, what are the rights of the wife of any one of us over us?’ He said, ‘That you feed her when you feed yourself and clothe her when you clothe yourself, that you do not say to her, “May Allaah make your face ugly!”, and that you do not hit her.’”
(Reported by Abu Dawood, 2/244; Ibn Maajah, 1850; Ahmad, 4/446).
Imaam al-Baghawi said: “Al-Khattaabi said: this is a command to spend on women and clothe them, according to the capabilities of the husband. As the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made this a right of women, it is necessary whether the husband is present or absent. If the husband is not able to do it, it become a debt which he owes, as with all other duties, whether or not the qaadi (judge) issues a decree to that effect.”
It was reported that Wahb said:
“A freed slave of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr said to him, ‘I want to go and spend this month there in Jerusalem.’ He said, ‘Have you left enough for your family to live on during this month?’ He said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Then go back to your family and leave them what they need, for I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saying: “It is enough sin for a man not to give food to the one whom he is supposed to feed.”’”
(Reported by Ahmad, 2/160; Abu Dawood, 1692).
The original report in is Muslim, where the wording is, “It is enough sin for a man to withhold food from the one whom he is supposed to feed.”
Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah will ask everyone who has been given responsibility about whatever he was responsible for, until He asks a man about his family.” (Reported by Ibn Hibaan).
Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:
“I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saying, ‘By Allaah, if one of you were to get up in the morning and carry firewood on his back, and sell it and meet his own needs from the money and give some away in charity, this would be better for him than coming to a man and begging from him, and either being given something or not. The upper hand (the one which gives) is better than the lower hand (the one that takes), and start with those for whom you are responsible.” (Reported by Muslim, 3/96). According to a report narrated by Ahmad
(2/524), it was said: “For whom am I responsible, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “Your wife is one of those for whom you are responsible.”
According to a hadeeth narrated by Jaabir ibn Samurah (may Allaah be pleased with him), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If Allaah gives something good to any one of you, let him start with himself and his family.”
(Reported by Muslim, 1454).
With regard to the consensus of the scholars:
Imaam Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (7/564):
“The scholars are agreed that it is the duty of husbands to spend on their wives if they (the husbands) have reached the age of puberty, except in the case of a wife who is rebellious. This was mentioned by Ibn al-Mundhir and others.”
The above references to the texts of Islam indicate that it is obligatory for a man to spend on his family and to take care of their interests. Many hadeeth narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) demonstrate the virtue of this action and show that it is a righteous action in the sight of Allaah. Abu Mas’ood al-Ansaari (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When the Muslim spends on his family with the hope of earning reward, this is an act of charity for him.”
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 1/136).
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Fath (9/498): “Spending on one's family is obligatory according to scholarly consensus. Islam called it sadaqah (charity) lest people think that they are doing it as a duty for which there is no reward, because they knew how much reward there is in giving charity, so that they will not give charity to others until they have given enough to their families. This was to encourage them to give priority to the charity that is obligatory before they give voluntary charity.”
Sa’d ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him: “Whatever you spend on your family, you will be rewarded for it, even the mouthful which you lift up and place in your wife’s mouth.”
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3/164, and Muslim, 1628).
Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A dinar that you spend in the way of Allaah, a dinar that you spend to free a slave, a dinar that you give to the poor, and a dinar that you spend on your family – the greatest of these is the one that you spend on your family. “ (reported by Muslim, 2/692).
Ka’b ibn ‘Ujarah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “A man passed by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and his Companions were impressed by the man's strength and energy. They said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, if only this was for the sake of Allaah!’ The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘If he goes out to work for the sake of his young children, he is striving for the sake of Allaah; if he goes out to work for the sake of his aged parents, he is striving for the sake of Allaah; if he goes out to work to keep himself from having to beg, he is striving for the sake of Allaah; but if he goes out to work for the purposes of showing off and boasting, then he is striving in the way of the Shaytaan.”
(Reported by al-Tabaraani, Saheeh al-Jaami’, 2/8).
The salaf, may Allaah have mercy on them, understood this duty properly. It was their guideline in their day-to-day life with their families. No one put it better than Imaam al-Rabaani ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Mubaarak (may Allaah have mercy on him), who said: “There is nothing better than earning one's own living, not even jihaad for the sake of Allaah.” (al-Siyar, 8/399)
It is not permissible for a Muslim to neglect his family even if he claims that he is travelling for the purpose of worship and righteous deeds, because neglecting one’s family and failing to spend on them is haraam. We have quoted above the advice given by ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr to the one who wanted to stay in Jerusalem: he had to make arrangements for his family’s provision first. So you have to advise your father of the things we have said in this reply, and explain the matter to him politely and kindly. If you can fill the gap left by your father’s negligence by spending some of your own money on your family as much as you can, you will get a great reward, in sha Allaah. We ask Allaah to put all our affairs right. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
3044,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3044,"Problem between a daughter and her
    mother","AssalmualaykumFor the past 23 years, i endured a lot of physical and mental abuse
      from my beloved mother. In all this time, 
      i have tried very hard to swallow my pain and tolerate it , purely because she is my
      mother, regardless. But, sadly, now, at the age of 23 I am finding it very difficult to
      Tolerate it anymore. Her constant physical and verbal abuse has made me so ill, that i
      have been hospitalised for stress and been recommended to seek professional help. But i
      don't want to see a psychologist who would feed me with information and advice that is
      hostile to the Islamic point of view.
      
      I ma a very pious women,and know how highly regarded mothers are in Islam, and they have
      to be respected regardless. But what about me? Why have i done to deserve all this? Just
      recently, i have learnt, from my father, that she is mentally disturbed, and is a product
      of her hostile upbringing. But that still doesn't help me? 
      As i write to you now, she sits outside in the lounge, and refuses to talk to me and works
      very hard to make my four sisters and brothers not talk to me either. Sadly, they comply,
      so not to make her upset. What really upsets me is that she curses me a lot and makes very
      bad du'oas for me, like wish that i die soon from a horrible disease or go to hell. 
      My real concern is, how much of that would God listen to?  What is God's opinion of
      me? What's His opinion of her?  And what do i do now? Please help and and let me know
      what my rights and obligations are as a Muslim daughter. Can mothers do that just because
      they are mothers and paradise lay under their feet? What about the children? Jazak allah khayra",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah has commanded us to treat our parents well, and He has linked
    this to the command to worship Him and the prohibition of associating anything in worship
    with Him. The rights of the mother in this regard have been emphasized more than those of
    the father.
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Worship none but
    Allaah (Alone) and be dutiful and good to parents [al-Baqarah 2:83]. Ibn
    Abbaas said: This means treating them with respect and kindness, and lowering
    the wing of humility to them, not answering them harshly or glaring at them, not raising
    one's voice to them, but being as humble towards them as a slave towards his master.
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And your Lord has decreed that you
    worship none but Him, and that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of
    them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, not shout at them,
    but address them in terms of honour. And lower unto them the wing of submission and
    humility through mercy, and say: My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did
    bring me up when I was small. [al-Isra 17:23-24]. Al-Baghawi (may
    Allaah have mercy on him) said: This means not saying anything that may contain the
    slightest hint of irritation. [The word uff in the aayah, translated
    here as a word of disrepect] comes from the word aff, which
    is similar to the word taff; both words refer to the dirt that collects
    under fingernails, and [in Arabic] when one is annoyed and fed up with something, one says
    uff! to it.
Abu Baddaah al-Tajeebi said: I said to Saeed ibn
    al-Musayyab: I understood everything in the Quraan about respecting ones
    parents, apart from the aayah (interpretation of the meaning) But address them in
    terms of honour [al-Isra 17:23]. What are these terms of honour [al-qawl
    al-kareem]? Ibn al-Musayyab said: It is the way in which a slave who has
    done wrong approaches a harsh and strict master.
The obligation of treating ones parents with kindness and respect
    is not confined only to Muslim parents; they should be honoured in this way even if they
    are kaafirs. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And We have enjoined on
    man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship
    upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years  give thanks to Me and
    to your parents, - unto Me is the final destination. But if they (both) strive with you to
    make you join in worship with Me others of which you have no knowledge, then obey them
    not, but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to me
    in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your return, and I shall tell you what
    you used to do. [Luqmaan 31:14-15].
If Allaah has told us to treat even these parents with respect and
    kindness, in spite of the heinous sin which they are telling their child to commit, which
    is the crime of associating something in worship with Allaah, then what do you think is
    the case with Muslim parents, especially if they are righteous? By Allaah, their rights
    are among the most important and most certain rights, and fulfilling these rights in a
    proper manner is one of the most difficult and most important duties. The one who is
    guided to do this is truly guided, and the one who is not helped to do this is truly
    deprived. Innumerable ahaadeeth also confirm this. According to a hadeeth narrated by Abu
    Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him): A man came to the Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allaah, who among the
    people is most deserving of my good companionship? He said, Your mother.
    He asked, Then whom? He said, Your mother. He asked, Then
    whom? He said, Your mother. He asked, Then whom? He said,
    Then your father. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4/13, and Muslim,
    2548).
    Makhool said: Respecting ones parents is an
    expiation for major sins.
You have to be patient with your mother and put up with the harsh
    treatment on her part, which is upsetting you. By treating her with respect and dealing
    with her kindly, you will earn her good pleasure and love. Try to avoid things that will
    provoke her and make her angry, even if they are in your interests, without causing harm
    to yourself. Your mother, for her part, has to treat you well and stop harming you with
    her blows and insults.
With regard to what you mention about her praying against you, if these
    duaas are said for no good reason, they will not be accepted. It is not
    permissible for her to pray against you for no good reason, because of the general
    applicability of the Prophets words: [The prayers] of any of you will be
    answered, so long as he does not pray for sin or the breaking of family ties. This
    hadeeth indicates that if a duaa includes sin, it will definitely not be
    answered. There is no doubt that praying against ones child for no good reason is a
    sin.
We ask Allaah to help you to treat her with respect and earn her
    pleasure, and to help us all to do that which He loves and will please Him. May Allaah
    bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

She makes continual, costly demands of me and my financial situation does not allow for this because of my low wages. I told her and her family about my financial situation before we married. Now we have continuous arguments in which she accuses me of being stingy and I accuse her of being extravagant and demanding more of me than I can do. What should I do about this situation that has brought us to the brink of separation?",,,"Praise be to Allah.One of the most important rights that a wife has is that her husband should spend on her, and his spending on her is one of the greatest good deeds that he can do that will bring him closer to Allah. This spending covers food, drink, clothing and housing, and all the other things that a wife needs for her sustenance and good health.
With regard to what you mention of your wifes complaints that you are not spending enough on her, Allah tells us that men are the ones who should spend on women, and they have been given the position of qawwaamah (protector and maintainer) and excellence because of the money they spend on them in the mahr and on their maintenance. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means [al-Nisa 4:34]. The Quran, Sunnah and consensus of the scholars (ijmaa) all indicate that this spending is obligatory.
The Quran tells us (interpretation of the meanings):
the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mothers food and clothing on a reasonable basis. No person shall have a burden laid on him greater than he can bear [al-Baqarah 2:233]
And if they are pregnant, then spend on them till they deliver [al-Talaaq 65:6]
With regard to the evidence of the Sunnah, many ahaadith have been narrated which indicate that it is obligatory for a husband to spend on his wife and children and those under his guardianship, as was proven in the hadith of Jaabir ibn Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him), who reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in his Farewell Sermon: Fear Allah with regard to women, for they are your prisoners. You have taken them as a trust from Allah, and they have become permissible to you by the word of Allah, and they have the right to be fed and clothed reasonably by you.
(Reported by Muslim, 8/183).
Umar ibn al-Ahwas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say during the Farewell Pilgrimage: Take good care of women, for they are your prisoners and you have no rights over them beyond that, except if they commit open illegal lewdness; if they do that, then you should shun them in their beds and strike them, but not in a way that causes pain. And if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). You have rights over your women and your women have rights over you. Your rights over your women are that they should not allow anyone to sit on your beds whom you dislike, or allow anyone to enter your houses who you dislike, and their rights over you are that you should clothe and feed them properly.
(Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1163; Ibn Maajah, 1851. Al-Tirmidhi said this is a hasan saheeh hadith).
Muaawiyah ibn Haydah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I said, O Messenger of Allah, what is the right of the wife of any one of us over us? He said: That you should feed her as you feed yourself and clothe her as you clothe yourself, that you should not say to her May Allah make your face ugly! and that you should not beat her.
(Reported by Abu Dawood, 2/244; Ibn Maajah, 1850; Ahmad, 4/446).
Imaam al-Baghawi said: Al-Khattaabi said: This means that it is obligatory to spend on her and clothe her, according to the means of the husband. Because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made it a right of the wife, it is obligatory on the husband whether he is present or absent. If he is not able to do this at any particular time, it becomes a debt that he owes, as in the case of other duties, whether or not the qaadi (judge) imposes it on him for the time when he is absent.
Wahb said: A freed slave of Abd-Allah ibn Amr said to him: I want to spend this month here in Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). He said, Have you left your family anything for their provisions during this month? He said, No. He said, Then go back to your family and leave them something for their provisions, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saying, It is enough sin for a man to neglect those he is responsible to feed.
(Reported by Ahmad, 2/160; Abu Dawood, 1692)
The original hadith is reported by Muslim (245), with the wording: It is enough sin for a man to keep food away from those he is responsible to feed.
Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Allah will ask every responsible person (literally, shepherd) about those for whom he was responsible, whether he took care of them or not, and He will even ask a man about the members of his household.
(Reported by Ibn Hibbaan and classed as hasan in Saheeh al-Jaami, 1774).
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: By Allah, if one of you were to go out in the morning and gather firewood on his back, and sell it and make himself independent, and give some of it in charity, this is better for him than his coming to a man and asking for anything, whether he gives or refuses. The upper hand is better than the lower hand, and start with those who are under your care.
(Reported by Muslim, 3/96). According to a report narrated by Ahmad (2/524): It was said, Who are those who are under our care, O Messenger of Allah? He said, Your wife is one of those who are under your care.
With regard to the consensus of the scholars (ijmaa):
Imaam Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (7/564): The scholars are agreed that it is obligatory on men to spend on their wives, except in the case of a wife who is rebellious. This was mentioned by Ibn al-Mundhir and others.
The texts referred to above indicate that it is obligatory for a man to spend on his household and to take care of them and their best interests. Numerous ahaadith reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) describe the virtue of this and state that it is a righteous deed in the sight of Allah, for example the hadith of Abu Masood al-Ansaari (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: If a Muslim spends on his wife, and hopes for reward from Allah, it will be counted as sadaqah (charity) on his part.
(Reported by al-Bukhari, 1/136).
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Fath (9/498): Spending on ones wife is obligatory according to consensus (ijmaa), and Islam described it as charity lest people think that it is only a duty for which they will not be rewarded, for they already know the rewards for charity. Islam taught them that it will be counted as charity so that they will not give to others besides their wives until they (the wives) have enough, to encourage them to give obligatory charity before they give voluntary charity.
Sad ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: No matter what you spend on your family, you will be rewarded, even for the morsel of food you put in your wifes mouth.
(Reported by al-Bukhari, 3/164, and Muslim, 1628).
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: A dinar spent for the sake of Allah, a dinar spent to free a slave, a dinar given in charity to a poor person, and a dinar spent on ones wife the greatest in reward of all these is the dinar spent on one's wife.
(Reported by Muslim, 2/692)
Kab ibn Ijrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man passed by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and his Companions were impressed with how strong and energetic he appeared. They said, O Messenger of Allah, if only this was for the sake of Allah! The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: If he is going out to earn a living for his young children, this is for the sake of Allah; if he is going out to earn a living for his aged parents, this is for the sake of Allah; if he is going out to earn a living so he can keep himself from begging from others, this is for the sake of Allah; but if he is going out to boast and show off, then this is for the sake of Shaytaan.
(Reported by al-Tabaraani, Saheeh al-Jaami, 2/8)
The salaf (may Allah have mercy on them) understood this duty properly, and said words to that effect. How marvellous are the words of the great imaam Abd-Allah ibn al-Mubaarak (may Allah have mercy on him): There is nothing equivalent in reward to earning money to spend on your family, not even jihaad for the sake of Allah. (Al-Siyar, 8/399).
At the same time, your wife should understand that the husbands obligation to spend should be within his means and according to his financial situation, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): Let the rich man spend according to his means, and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allah has given him. Allah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him. Allah will grant after hardship, ease. [al-Talaaq 65:7]
She has no right to mistreat her husband by asking him for too much and expecting him to exhaust himself in spending on her; that is bad treatment indeed. Perhaps if you grant her some of her reasonable requests and remind her, gently and tactfully, of the requests that you have fulfilled, you may be able to lessen her anger somewhat and persuade her to stop asking for more. You could also discuss with her, quietly and without resorting to arguing, how important her requests really are and how necessary it is to keep a certain amount for things that are more important, like paying the rent and so on. This may also persuade her to stop asking.
Know that what you lack in financial resources can be compensated for with kind words and promises for when things get better. When Allah mentioned taking care of ones relatives and upholding family ties, He also mentioned what a person can do who does not have money to give to his relatives. He says (interpretation of the meaning): And if you turn away from them (relatives, the poor etc. whom We have ordered you to give their rights, but you have no money at the time they ask for it) and you are awaiting a mercy from your Lord for which you hope, then speak unto them a kind, soft word (i.e., Allah will give me and I shall give you). [al-Isra 18:28]
Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his interpretation of this aayah: And if you turn away from them (relatives, the poor etc. whom We have ordered you to give their rights, but you have no money at the time they ask for it) and you are awaiting a mercy from your Lord for which you hope means: if your relatives ask you for something that We have commanded you to give them, and you do not have anything, and you turn away from them because you have nothing to spend on them, then speak unto them a kind, soft word which means, promise them, gently and kindly, that when the provision of Allah comes, we will give it to you, in sha Allah.
Know that a good attitude will make her forget the hardship you are going through. You have to be patient and treat her kindly, whilst repeating your advice. If life becomes too difficult and the situation between you deteriorates to such an extent that you reach a total impasse, if your efforts do not succeed and life becomes unbearable, then Allah has permitted divorce in such cases, and this may indeed be better for both parties, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): But if they separate (by divorce), Allah will provide abundance for everyone of them from His Bounty. And Allah is Ever All-Sufficient for His creatures need, All-Wise. [al-Nisa 4:130]",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
3062,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3062,Is it permissible    for Muslims to vote for kaafirs who seem to be less evil?,Some Moslems in a non Islamic country are asking if it is OK to participate in the elections there and vote for non Moslem groups or parties. They claim that it would serve the Moslem community there if a certain group won the elections?,,,"Praise be to Allah.This is a matter concerning which rulings may differ according to different circumstances in different times and places. There is no absolute ruling that covers all situations, both real and hypothetical.
In some cases it is wrong to vote, such as when the matter will have no effect on the Muslims, or when the Muslims have no effect on the outcome of the vote. In this case voting or not voting is all the same. The same applies in cases where all the candidates are equally evil or where they all have the same attitude towards Muslims…
It may be the case that the interests of Islam require Muslims to vote so as to ward off the greater evil and to reduce harmful effects, such as where two candidates may be non-Muslims but one of them is less hostile towards Muslims than the other, and Muslims’ votes will have an impact on the outcome of the election. In such cases there is nothing wrong with Muslims casting their votes in favour of the less evil candidate.
In any case, this is the matter of ijtihaad based on the principle of weighing up the pros and cons, what is in the interests of Islam and what is detrimental. With regard to this matter, we have to refer to the people of knowledge who understand this principle. We should put the question to them, explaining in detail the circumstances and laws in the country where the Muslim community is living, the state of the candidates, the importance of the vote, the likely benefits, and so on.
No one should imagine that anyone who says that it is OK to vote is thereby expressing approval or support for kufr. It is done in the interests of the Muslims, not out of love for kufr and its people. The Muslims rejoiced when the Romans defeated the Persians, as did the Muslims in Abyssinia (Ethiopia) when the Negus defeated those who had challenged his authority. This is well known from history. Whoever wants to be on the safe side and abstain from voting is allowed to do so. This response applies only to elections for influential positions.

My question is of differentiating between what is Zikhr & waht is Bidha. My daily drive to work take me approx. 2hrs and to make good use of this time I Listen to the Quran (Arabic with English Translation) on the way to work and on the way home, I try to say some duas I learnt from a books that were given to me. These book published in India/Pakistan suggest that I should recite a particular dua for 100 times and another dua for 500 times etc.... All the duas in these books have the number of times I should recite them. I have researched many authentic hadiths and cannot find this reciting by certain amount. As a result am I committing Bidha if I recite these duas by the amounts suggested in these books. If so, is there any authentic books you could recommend where I can learne and recite daily duas for Zikhr purposes.
Jazak Allah Khair.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Some saheeh reports from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) describe duaas that can be recited one hundred times during the day and night, such as that reported by Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, Whoever says Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, lahul-mulk wa lahul-hamd wa huwa ala kulli shayin Qadeer (There is no god but Allaah Alone, with no partner or associate; His is the Dominion and His is the Praise, and He is Able to do all things), one hundred times in a day, it will be equivalent (in reward) to freeing ten slaves, and a hundred hasanaat (good deeds) will be recorded for him, and one hundred sayiaat (bad deeds) will be erased from his record; it will be a protection for him from the Shaytaan all that day until evening comes, and nobody can do any better than that except one who does more than that.
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3050).
Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) also reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever says Subhaan Allaah wa bi hamdih (Glory and praise be to Allaah) one hundred times in a day, his sins will be wiped out even if they are like the foam of the sea.

In some cases the samples are more than is required for testing. For example, a carton of juice holds 30 boxes, and the tests require only 5 boxes. There are many similar examples. Is it permissible for the lab technicians to take them or give them to some deserving people? Knowing that leaving them until all the lab and customs procedures are completed would mean that they may go off and have to be thrown out, and, moreover, many of the traders never come and ask about the rest of their samples.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly:
      those who are responsible for requesting samples for quality-control
      testing must ask for the amount that is usually sufficient for testing,
      and not ask for or accept more than what is needed.
Secondly:
      in cases where only some of the amount given is sufficient, whatever is
      left over must be handed back to its owner. His address should be written
      down on the sample, and an appointment should be made to give back
      whatever is left over from the tests. A name of a contact person and an
      address should also be obtained, so that the goods may be returned.
Thirdly:
      in the event that the owner of the goods or his representative does not
      keep the appointment, and there is the fear that the samples may go off,
      then they may be sold and the money raised should be given to Bayt

      cannot be sold, they should be given away to the people who are usually

3075,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3075,"Ruling on praying
    in a torn garment","If one fnds a hole in their prayer garment, and realizes that he/she has
      been praying in such a condition (the 'awra could be seen through the hole) for some time,
      are all of his/her prayers in need of being repeated? If so, and the person does not know
      for how long this occurred, how can they be sure they made up enough prayers?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars, may Allaah have mercy on them, agreed that covering the
    awrah is a condition of the validity of ones prayer. The evidence for this is
    the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): O Children of Adam! Take your
    adornment (by wearing your clean clothes) while praying [al-Araaf 7:31]
The conditions for clothes to cover the awrah properly are as
    follows:
They should not show the shape or contours of the body; if they do so,
        this is no good because it does not cover properly.
They should be clean (taahir). If the clothes are unclean or impure
        (naajis), then it is not correct to pray in them, because it is haraam to have any
        impurity (najaasah) on ones body or clothes when praying. Allaah says
        (interpretation of the meaning): And your garments purify! [al-Muddaththir
        74:4]. It was reported that a baby boy who was not yet eating solid food was brought
        to the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he sat the infant in his
        lap. The child urinated in his lap, and he called for water and poured it over the urine.
        The fact that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) hastened to wash
        the childs urine from his clothes indicates that it is obligatory to clean
        ones clothes of any impurity that may get on them.
They should be permissible, not haraam, whether they are haraam in and
        of themselves, such as silk garments, or because of the way in which they are made, such
        as garments that come below the ankles, or because of the way in which they were acquired,
        such as garments seized by force or stolen. 
With regard to the matter of the awrah becoming uncovered during
    prayer, al-Shaafa'i, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: It is good enough for both
    men and women to pray with their awrah covered. The mans awrah is what I
    have already described (i.e., from the navel to theknee), and all of a woman is awrah, apart from her
    face and hands. The top of her feet is also awrah. If during prayer any part of the
    area between a mans navel and knees becomes uncovered, or any part of a womans
    hair, whether it is a lot or a little, or any part of her body apart from her face and
    hands and wrist  and no more than that  becomes uncovered, whether they
    realize it or not, then both (man and woman) must repeat the prayer  unless it was
    uncovered by the wind, or it slipped and was immediately replaced without delay (no longer
    than it takes to pick up the garment and place it back immediately.) (Al-Shaafa'i, Kitaab
    al-Umm, Baab Kayfiyyat Libs al-Thiyaab fil-Salaah). 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his book al-Mughni:
    Section: if a little bit of the awrah becomes uncovered, this does not
    invalidate the prayer. This is the opinion of Ahmad and Abu Haneefah. Al-Shaafa'i said:
    It invalidates the prayer because it is a ruling that has to do with the
    awrah, and it is the same whether it is a little or a lot, as is the case with
    looking (at the awrah). We have what was reported by Abu Dawood, with his
    isnaad from Ayyoob, from Amr ibn Salamah al-Jarmi, who said: My father went
    with a group from his people to the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
    upon him), and he taught them how to pray. He said, The one who reads Quraan
    best among you should lead you in prayer. I was the best at reading Quraan, so
    they appointed me. I used to lead them in prayer wearing a small yellow burdah (cloak or
    garment), and when I prostrated, my awrah became uncovered. One of the women said,
    Cover the awrah of your reciter for us! so they bought me an Omani
    shirt, and I never rejoiced over anything  apart from Islam  as much as I
    rejoiced over that. Reported by Abu Dawood. Al-Nasaa'i also reported from
    Aasim al-Ahwal, from Amr ibn Salamah, who said: I used to lead them in
    prayer wearing a burdah made of two attached parts in which there was a gap. When I
    prostrated in it, my backside showed. This was common and was not denounced, and we
    have not heard that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or any of his
    Companions denounced it, because if prayer is still valid despite a severe problem where
    there is an excuse, then we should differentiate between whether the problem is severe or
    not where there is no excuse; it is like the case of walking during the prayer. Avoiding
    little matters may be too difficult, so a little is excused, as is the case with blood.
    Once this is clear, the definition of a lot is that which is offensive to look at, and in
    this case there is no differentiation between the private parts and other parts of the
    awrah. A little is that which is not offensive, and the point of reference is that
    which is customary, except that the two private parts are more offensive than anything
    else, so that is considered to be an obstacle to prayer This is a matter in which
    Islam did not define what is offensive, so the point of reference is what is customary, as
    also applies in the case of excessive movement during the prayer
If these holes show what is customarily regarded to be too much of the
    awrah, and it shows it for a while, or it is not possible to cover them because the
    garment is too small, for example, then the prayer is not valid, because covering the
    awrah is one of the conditions of prayer, and if one of the conditions is not met
    without a valid excuse such as inability to meet it, then the prayer is not valid. You
    have to repeat the prayers which you did wearing this garment. If you do not know how many
    they were, you should take what you are certain of. For example, if you think that they
    may have been four or three or five, but definitely not more than five, then what you can
    be certain of in this case is five, and so on. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

      live with our father after we moved to the US. He had already divorced 3 women including
      my mother. We found out that all he cares about is money. He treated us well as long as we
      gave him money. My younger brother left us because of his rude and greedy behaviour. 
      We found out that he drinks beer and alcohol and does Zinaah. He didn't even care about
      us. He brought women even in our presence. We tried to stop him but he would abuse us
      verbally and even beat us. He even accuses my mother of doing haram things and disowns his
      own son from his fatherhood. He does this just because my  brother refused to give
      him his paycheck. He never persuaded us to perform Salat and fast during Ramadan, and
      neither he did it himself. Instead he asked me to drink beer and I drank beer a couple of
      times. 
      I'm married now Alahumdulillah. I and my husband do our Salat regularly and I fast to
      compensate for the days I didn't fast during Ramadan. I always repent to Allah to forgive
      me for the bad things I did intentionally and unintentionally. My husband has been helping
      me with all this.

      married. He asked her to drink beer with him and his girl friend but she harshly refused.
      She had to lock door to sleep. She didn' t trust him at all. So I asked her to live with
      us as she didn t have any other place to go (My mother lives in another country).
      I' ve questions in this regards.

      his haram habits and truly repent to ALLAH. Is this right ?

    with Allaah; sufficient unto us is Allaah and He is the best Disposer of affairs; verily
    we belong to Allaah and unto Him we will return). [These are duaas
    recited by Muslims when faced with calamity  Translator] Does he not
    know that Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
     Ward off from yourselves and your families a Fire
    (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are appointed angels stern (and) severe,
    who disobey not (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allaah, but do that which
    they are commanded.[al-Tahreem 66:6]
Does he not know that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah
    be upon him) said:
There is no person to whom Allaah has given responsibility and
    dies neglecting that responsibility, but Allaah will deny him Paradise. (Reported
    by Muslim, 203)
    Every one of you is a shepherd and every one of
    you is responsible for his flock (those under his care) a man is the shepherd over
    the members of his household and he is responsible for them
Allaah will ask every shepherd about that for which
    he was responsible. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1627).
    There is no person to whom Allaah has given
    responsibility over others and he failed to take care of them by advising them sincerely,
    but he will never smell the fragrance of Paradise. (Reported by al-Bukhaari,
    6617).
    We ask Allaah to bring this man back to the truth.
Know that even though your father has caused you so much suffering, it
    is not permissible for you to sever your ties with him, in spite of all that you have
    mentioned. You must keep in touch with him and treat him kindly. You and your siblings
    should treat him kindly and express your fears for him and your love for him, because of
    his rights as a father, and because severing ties with him and ignoring him in a hostile
    manner will only make matters worse. Neither you nor your siblings should obey him in sin.
    You mention in your message that your father used to treat you well when you gave him
    money, so if giving him money will put an end to his bad treatment and make things go back
    to normal, so that you will treat one another well and he will see love and sacrifice on
    your part, then why not do that? This is provided that he does not use this money to buy
    haraam things. Try to restrain your anger and forget his past shortcomings in his
    behaviour towards you. Try to honour him and show love towards him. Visit him and look
    after him. Maybe this will stir up true fatherly feelings in him, and maybe stop him from
    doing haraam things. Dont even think of severing ties with him. Get in touch with
    your brother and ask him to get back in touch with his father. Know that your being
    patient with him is a kind of jihaad, which will be rewarded. The idea of not visiting him
    until he repents is not right, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others
    that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not, but behave with them in the world
    kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Then to
    Me will be your return, and I shall tell you what you used to do. [Luqmaan 31:15]
Visit him, so long as it does not cause you unbearable harm or make you
    do wrongful things. Know that one of the ways to make a sinner repent is having someone
    who will call him to repent and remind him of Allaah. A child has to treat his parents
    honourably even if they are mushrikeen. Al-Qurtubi said:
The aayah indicates that one should honour kaafir parents as much
    as possible by spending on them if they are poor, by speaking kindly to them, and by
    calling them to Islam.
With regard to your sister, she must be careful when she stays with her
    immoral father. Locking herself in is a good safety measure and may well be essential at
    times. If she does not feel safe in the home of this immoral father, she should go and
    live somewhere else where she can be safe, such as in your house, if it is suitable. Maybe
    Allaah will give her a righteous husband who will take care of her and protect her.

      feature stated that one of the signs of the last days were; that the Quran
      would disappear. I have not heard this. And how could it be true why we
      have many many hafis of Qurans.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There are a
      number of ahaadeeth which indicate that the Qur’aan will be taken away
      at the end of time. Among these ahaadeeth are the following:
From
      ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood, who said: “Something will come and take the
      Qur’aan one night and not one aayah will be left, either in the Mus-haf
      or in the heart of any person, but it will be taken away.” (Narrated by
      al-Daarimi with a saheeh isnaad, no. 3209)
 Al-Daarimi
      narrated with a different saheeh isnaad (no. 3207) that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn
      Mas’ood said: “Recite the Qur’aan much before it is taken away.”
      They said, “These Mus-hafs will be taken away! What about that which is
      (memorized) in men’s hearts?” He said: “Something will come and take
      it one night, and in the morning they will wake up without it. They will
      forget the phrase ‘laa ilaaha
      ill-Allaah’ and they will start to recite the sayings and
      poetry of the Jaahiliyyah. That is when the Word will be fulfilled against
      them.”
 The
      phrase ‘That is when the Word will be fulfilled against them’ is a
      reference to the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
 “And when the Word (of torment) is fulfilled against them, We
      shall bring out from the earth a beast for them, to speak to them because
      mankind believed not with certainty in Our Ayaat (Verses of the Qur’aan
      and Prophet Muhammad)” [al-Naml 27:82].
 Ibn
      Katheer said in his tafseer of this aayah:
 This
      beast will emerge at the end of time when mankind becomes so corrupt that
      they neglect the commandments of Allaah and change the true religion.
      Allaah will bring forth for them a beast from the earth – it was said
      from Makkah, or from elsewhere – and it will speak to the people
      concerning that. Ibn ‘Abbaas, al-Hasan and al-Qutaadah said – and it
      was also narrated from ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib – (may Allaah be pleased
      with them all): it will speak to them, i.e., it will address them.
      ‘Ataa’ al-Khurasaani said – and it was narrated from ‘Ali and this
      was the view favourd by Ibn Jareer: it will speak to them and it will say
      to them, ‘mankind believed not with
      certainty in Our Ayaat’. There are some reservations about this interpretation, and Allaah
      knows best.
 According
      to one report, Ibn ‘Abbaas said: the words tukallimuhum
      (to speak to them) means, it will wound them;
      according to another report he said: it will do both (i.e., speak to them
      and wound them). [The
      word Tukallim
      may mean either speak or wound. – Translator].
      This is a good point with no contradictions, and Allaah knows best.
 (Tafseer
      al-Qur’aan al-‘Azeem,
      3/375-378)
 Many
      ahaadeeth and reports have been narrated about the beast, such as the
      following:
It
      was reported that Hudhayfah ibn Usayd al-Ghiffaari said: The Messenger of
      Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw us from a room
      whilst we were talking about the Hour. He said: “The Hour will not come
      until you see ten signs: the rising of the sun from the west; the smoke;
      the beast; the emergence of Ya’jooj and Ma’jooj; the appearance of
      ‘Eesaa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him); the Dajjaal (“antichrist”);
      three landslides – one in the west, one in the east and one in the
      Arabian Peninsula; and fire which will emerge from the direction of
      ‘Aden and will drive – or gather – the people, stopping with them
      whenever they rest overnight or during the siesta hour.”

      of Allaah be upon him) said:
“There
      are three things which, when they appear, it will not benefit anyone to
      believe if he did not believe before: the Dajjaal, the beast and the
      rising of the sun from the west – or from the place where it sets.”
(Narrated by
      al-Tirmidhi, no. 3072; he said it is a saheeh hasan hadeeth).
 It
      was reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace
      and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
 “Hasten
      to do good deeds before six things come to pass: the rising of the sun
      from the place where it sets; the smoke; the Dajjaal; the beast; or
      personal calamities or general tribulations.”
(narrated
      by Muslim, no. 2947; Ibn Maajah, no. 4056, and others).
      There are many ahaadeeth which speak of the beast which will emerge at the
      end of time, but it would take too long to quote them all here. And Allaah
      is the Source of strength.
 Further
      evidence that the Qur’aan will be taken away at the end of time is to be
      found in the report narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Mu’jam
      al-Kabeer, no. 8698, according to which Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with
      him) said: 
“This
      Qur’aan will most certainly be taken away from amongst you.” He was
      asked: “O Abu ‘Abd al-Rahmaan, how will it be taken away when it is so
      deeply rooted in our hearts and is written in our mus-hafs?” He said:
      “Something will come to it at night, then there will be nothing left of
      it in people’s hearts or in the mus-haf, and the next morning the people
      will be like animals.” Then he recited the aayah (interpretation of the
      meaning): “And if We
      willed, We could surely, take away that which We have revealed to you
      (i.e. this Qur’aan). Then you would find no protector for you against Us
      in that respect” [al-Israa’ 17:86].
      Ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Baari
      (13/16): its isnaad is saheeh but it is mawqoof. Al-Haythami said in Majma’
      al-Zawaa’id, 7/329): its men are the men of saheeh, apart
      from Shaddaad ibn Ma’qil, who is thiqah. And it was classed as saheeh by
      al-Albaani.
 This
      hadeeth is to be regarded as marfoo’, because it deals with something
      which is not subject to opinion orijtihaad.
 Imaam Ibn
      Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo’
      al-Fataawaa (3/198): “At the end of time, something will come
      to it at night in the mus-hafs and in people’s hearts,then there will not be left one word of it in people’s hearts or
      one letter of it in the Mus-haf.”
 Allaah
      revealed the Qur’aan as a guidance to mankind and He guaranteed to
      protect it. It is the eternal miracle of the Prophet 
 (peace and
      blessings of Allaah be upon him) and it will remain, and people of earlier
      and later generations will learn from it and be guided by it, but at the
      end of time, just before the Hour comes, Allaah will take the souls of the
      believers, and there will be no one left on earth except the most evil of
      people. There will be no prayer, no fasting, no Hajj and no charity
      (zakaah). Then there will be no point in the Ka’bah being there or in
      the Qur’aan remaining among mankind, so Allaah will decree that the
      Ka’bah be destroyed at the hands of a kaafir from Ethiopia.Al-Bukhaari narrated in his Saheeh,
      no. 1519 that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
      him) said: “The Ka’bah will be destroyed by Dhu’l-Suwayqatayn from
      Ethiopia.” And Allaah will take the Qur’aan away from the earth, and
      not one aayah of it will be left in the mus-hafs or in people’s hearts.
      Allaah will not permit His Book to remain on earth if it is not
      benefitting anyone and no one is acting in accordance with it. So this
      thing will come to pass.
This
      frightening event makes the sincere Muslim hasten to pay attention to the
      Book of Allaah, to learn it, memorize it, recite it and ponder its
      meanings, before the Book is taken away.
This
      is one of the tribulations that will happen at the end of time, concerning
      which our Prophet 
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
“Hasten to do
      good deeds before tribulations come like patches of dark night, when a man
      will wake up as a believer and by evening he will be a kaafir, or in the
      evening he will be a believer and by morning he will be a kaafir, selling
      his religion for some worldly gains.” (narrated by Muslim, no. 169).
 We ask
      Allaah to make us adhere firmly to His religion and to protect us from
      tribulations, both seen and unseen.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
3098,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3098,It is not permissible for a woman to travel for Hajj except with a mahram,Is it possible for a women to go to hajj or umrah in a group of people or in a group of women if there is no mahram willing to go with her?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars, past and present, differed concerning this issue. Some of them said that it is permissible for a woman to travel for Hajj without a mahram if the road is safe and she is with a trustworthy group. 
Some of them said that it is not permissible for her to travel except with a mahram who can protect her, even if she is with a trustworthy group. This is the view of Abu Haneefah and Ahmad. They quoted the following as evidence: 
1 – It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No woman should travel except with a mahram, and no man should enter upon a woman unless there is a mahram with her.”  A man said: “O Messenger of Allah, I want to go out with such and such an army, and my wife wants to go for Hajj.” He said: “Go for Hajj with her.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (1763) and Muslim (1341). 
2 – It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to travel for the distance of one day and one night except with her mahram.” Narrated by al-Bukhari (1038) and Muslim (133). According to al-Bukhari (1139) and Muslim (827), from the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed: “The distance of two days.” 
Ibn Hajar said: 
In the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed it is limited to “the distance of two days” and in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah it is limited to “the distance of one day and one night.” There are also other reports. In the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar it is limited to “three days” and there are other reports too. 
Al-Nawawi said: The apparent meaning of this definition is not what is meant, rather everything that is regarded as travel is forbidden to a woman unless she has a mahram with her. The definition of the limits was in reference to specific incidents. Ibn al-Muneer said: The differences in the definitions arose because there was different questioners in different situations.

Fath al-Baari (4/75). 
Secondly: 
Those who say that a mahram is not required quoted the following as evidence: 
1 – It was narrated that ‘Adiyy ibn Haatim (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Whilst I was with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), a man came to him and complained of poverty. Then another came and complained about banditry. He said: “O ‘Adiyy have you seen al-al-Heerah?” I said: “I have not seen it, but I have been told about it.” He said: “If you live a long life, you will see a woman travelling from al-Heerah until she circumambulates the Ka’bah, fearing no one but Allah.” … ‘Adiyy said: And I saw a woman travelling from al-Heerah until she circumambulated the Ka’bah, fearing no one but Allah. 
Narrated by al-Bukhari (3400). 
This argument may be countered by noting that this was simply the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) foretelling this incident. Speaking of an incident does not mean that it is permissible. Rather it may be permissible or not, depending on the shar’i evidence. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also foretold that drinking alcohol, zina and a great deal of killing would become widespread before the Hour begins, and these are things that are forbidden and are major sins.
What is meant by the hadeeth is that security would become widespread, so that women would feel emboldened and one of them would travel without a mahram. It does not mean that it is permissible for a woman to travel without a mahram. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Not everything that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) foretold as signs of the Hour is haram or forbidden. If the shepherds compete in erecting tall buildings, and wealth becomes widespread, and there is one man to look after fifty women, these things are undoubtedly not haram. Rather these are signs, and a sign has nothing to do with whether it is halaal or haram. Rather a sign may be good or bad, permissible or haram or obligatory or anything else. And Allah knows best.

It should be noted that the difference of scholarly opinion regarding the necessity of having a mahram in order to perform Hajj applies to the obligatory Hajj only. As for naafil (supererogatory) Hajj, the scholars are all agreed that it is not permissible for a woman to travel except with a mahram or husband, as it says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (17/36). 
The scholars of the Standing Committee said: A woman who does not have a mahram is not obliged to perform Hajj, because having a mahram is part of being able for it, and being able for it is one of the conditions of Hajj being obligatory. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence)”[Aal ‘Imraan 3:97]
It is not permissible for her to travel for Hajj or anything else unless she has her husband or mahram with her. This is the view of al-Hasan, al-Nakha’i, Ahmad, Ishaaq, Ibn al-Mundhir and Ashaab al-Ra’y, and this is the correct view, because of the verse quoted above as well as the general meaning of the ahaadeeth which forbid a woman to travel without her husband or mahram. Maalik, al-Shaafa’i and al-Awzaa’i disagreed with that and they stipulated conditions for which they do not have any proof. Ibn al-Mundhir said: They ignored the apparent meaning of the hadeeth, and each of them stipulated conditions for which they did not have any proof. End quote. 
Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (11/90, 91). 
They also said: 
The correct view is that it is not permissible for her to travel for Hajj except with her husband or her mahram. It is not permissible for her to travel with trustworthy women without a mahram, or with her paternal aunt, maternal aunt or mother. Rather it is essential that she be with her husband or a mahram. 
If she cannot find someone to accompany her, then she is not obliged to do Hajj so long as that is the case.
