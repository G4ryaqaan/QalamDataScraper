41105,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41105,Ruling on working in a company that promotes satellite channels,"I am sending this message to you because I am so anxious about this problem, namely the place where I work. It is a satellite TV company, one of whose channels is the Iqra’ religious channel which broadcasts religious programming, but there are also other channels such as music channels and Arabic movies. What should I do? Praise be to Allaah, I am a religiously-committed and bearded young man and I follow the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). My work is in the switchboard of the company; I answer the phones and transfer calls to the employees, and vice versa. At the same time I am looking for other work, but I cannot find anything. In my heart I am worried because of this work. Every time I hear the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “The slave’s feet will not move on the Day of Resurrection until he has been asked about four things,” including his wealth, I get worried because of that. I hope that you will advise me.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    We ask Allaah to guide you towards that which is best for 
    your religious commitment and worldly affairs, and we ask Allaah to grant 
    you a goodly (halaal) provision and to bless it for you. 

    Your work in this company is not permissible, and it is 
    haraam earnings, because this company facilitates channels that promote 
    immorality, deviation and misguidance. 

    Allaah has forbidden us to commit sin and do haraam things 
    directly, and He has also forbidden us to help others in doing so. Allaah 
    says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Say (O Muhammad): (But) the things that my Lord has 
    indeed forbidden are Al‑Fawaahish (great evil sins and every kind of 
    unlawful sexual intercourse) whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of 
    all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in worship) with 
    Allaah for which He has given no authority, and saying things about Allaah 
    of which you have no knowledge”

    [al-‘Araaf 7:33] 
“Help you one another in 
    Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one 
    another in sin and transgression. And fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe 
    in punishment”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:2]
Anyone who thinks about 
    these immoral channels will be amazed by the audacity of these people in 
    spreading immorality and opposition to sharee’ah and decent morals. For 
    every deviation, temptation or misguidance caused by these channels to any 
    individual, those who produce and work for these channels have a share of 
    the sin. 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “That they may bear their own burdens in full on the Day 
    of Resurrection, and also of the burdens of those whom they misled without 
    knowledge. Evil indeed is that which they shall bear!”

    [al-Nahl 16:25]
It was narrated that Abu 
    Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “… whoever calls to misguidance will 
    have a burden of sin like that of those who follow him, without that 
    detracting from their sins in the slightest.” Narrated by Muslim, 2674. 

    Our advice to you is to leave this job, and look for other 
    work that is halaal and good. Be patient in bearing the problems that you 
    will encounter, for the reward of Allaah is precious. What matters is not 
    the work, rather what matters is that the work should be halaal. Beware of 
    nourishing your body on haraam food (earned through haraam work), and 
    remember that no soul will die until it has received its provision in full 
    and lived the time span decreed for it. Read the following hadeeth well and 
    think about it:

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “There is nothing that will bring you closer to Paradise but I have 
    enjoined it upon you, and there is nothing that will bring you closer to 
    Hell but I have forbidden it to you. The Holy Spirit (i.e. Jibreel) inspired 
    to me that no soul will die until it has been given its provision in full. 
    Fear Allaah and be moderate in seeking a living, and do not let the fact 
    that it is slow in coming make you seek it by disobeying Allaah, for that 
    which is with Allaah cannot be attained except by obeying Him.” See 
    al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 2866. 

    Remember that Allaah has commanded us to eat from that which 
    is good and permissible (al-tayyibaat) and He has told us that haraam wealth 
    is one of the things that prevent du’aa’s from being answered. 

    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “Allaah is Good and does not accept anything but that which 
    is good. Allaah has issued the same command to the believers as He issued to 
    the Messengers, when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 

    ‘O (you) Messengers! 
    Eat of the Tayyibaat [all kinds of Halaal (lawful) foods which Allaah has 
    made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, 
    vegetables, fruits)] and do righteous deeds. Verily, I am Well‑Acquainted 
    with what you do’

    [al-Mu’minoon 23:51] 

    ‘O you who believe (in the Oneness of Allaah — Islamic 
    Monotheism)! Eat of the lawful things that We have provided you with’

    [al-Baqarah 2:172].” 

    Then he mentioned a man who has traveled for a long time and 
    is disheveled and dusty, and stretches forth his hands towards heaven, 
    saying, “O Lord, O Lord,” but his food is haraam, his drink is haraam, his 
    clothing is haraam and his nourishment is haraam, so how could he receive a 
    response? Narrated by Muslim, 1015. 

    So seek the help of Allaah and seek reward from Allaah. We 
    ask Allaah to give you strength and guidance.

41114,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41114,Is the du`a of a sinner not answered?,The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that the one who eats or wears haraam things will receive no answer (to his du`a). Is the du`a of the sinner not answered?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Answer to the du`a of one who calls upon Allah is, in principle, an indication of the righteousness and piety of that person, but it does not always indicate that. A sinner’s du`a may be answered as a means of letting him get carried away or for a reason. Allah answered the prayer of the Shaytaan when he said: 
“ ‘O my Lord! Give me then respite till the Day they (the dead) will be resurrected.’
37. Allah said: ‘Then verily, you are of those reprieved’”
[al-Hijr 15:36-37]
This response was not an honour for him, rather it was a humiliation, to increase his sin so that his punishment would be greater – we seek refuge with Allah. 
And it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The prayer of the one who is oppressed is answered even if he is an evildoer, and his evildoing is upon himself.” Narrated by Ahmad. See Saheeh al-Jaami’, 3382. 
Similarly, the fact that a du`a is not answered does not always mean that the one who is praying is corrupt. There are some prayers which Allah did not grant our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I asked my Lord for three things, of which He granted me two…” Narrated by Muslim, 2890. 
Allah did not answer some of the prayers of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for an important reason, which was to teach mankind that he had no control over anything, rather everything was under the control of Allah.

41140,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41140,Is it permissible to wear a jacket in ihram if it is cold?,"Is it permissible for us to cover ourselves with jackets or something else when in ihram, if it is cold?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man said: “O Messenger of Allah, what garments may a muhrim (pilgrim in ihram) wear?” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The muhrim should not wear a shirt, pants, a burnous, or shoes, unless he cannot find any sandals, in which case he may wear something that comes below his ankles.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5458) and Muslim (1177). 
In this hadeeth the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade wearing things that are forbidden only for the muhrim, and are permitted to everyone else. By analogy with what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade, other things are also forbidden such as jackets and ‘abayas; if the pilgrim puts them on his shoulders then this is a garment that is forbidden, but it is permissible for him to wrap himself in them if he wants to keep warm without wearing them. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
Similarly it is permissible to wear anything that is akin to the izaar (waist-wrapper, lower garment) and rida’ (upper garment). So he may wrap himself in an ‘abayah, jubbah, shirt and so on, and cover himself – according to the majority of scholars – by wearing it sideways or upside down, and cover himself with a blanket and so on, but he should not cover his head with it except in the case of necessity. End quote. 
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (26/110). 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen said – discussing what male pilgrims are forbidden to wear in ihram – : He should not wear a shirt, turban, burnous, pants or shoes, unless he cannot find an izaar, in which case he may wear pants, or he cannot find sandals, in which case he may wear shoes. 
He should not wear anything that is similar to the things mentioned above, so he should not wear an ‘abayah, outer garment, hat, t-shirt and so on. End quote. 
Kayfa yu’addi al-Muslim Manaasik al-Hajj wa’l-‘Umrah (p.7,8). 
There is nothing wrong with wrapping a shirt around one's body without wearing it, and there is nothing wrong with wearing an ‘abayah as a rida’, so that it is not worn in the usual fashion. 
Manaasik al-Hajj wa’l-‘Umrah (p. 64). 
Based on this, if it is cold then the muhrim may wrap an ‘abayah or something else around himself, without wearing it in the usual manner. If he needs to wear a jacket because he cannot find anything else to keep the cold away, then there is no sin on him if he wears it, but he must pay the fidyah by sacrificing a sheep or fasting for three days, or feeding six poor persons. He may do any of these three things, because of the hadeeth of Ka’b ibn ‘Ujrah (may Allah have mercy on him): when he needed to shave his head when he was in ihram, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Shave (your head) and fast three days, or feed six poor people, or offer a sacrifice.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (4190) and Muslim (1201).

41143,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41143,Can You Do Hajj More Than Once?,Is it good to do more than one hajj or is it better to do only one hajj?,"With regard to what is obligatory, Hajj is only required once in a lifetime. With regard to what is preferable, the more a Muslim does of Hajj, the better, even if he can do Hajj every year.","Can you repeat the obligatory Hajj?


Hadiths on doing Hajj a great deal","Praise be to Allah.Can you repeat the obligatory Hajj?
With regard to what is obligatory, Hajj is only required once in a lifetime . Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) addressed us and said: “O people, Allah has enjoined Hajj on you, so perform Hajj.” A man said: “Is it every year, O Messenger of Allah?” He remained silent until (the man) said it three times. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If I said yes it would be obligatory and you would not be able to do it.” Then he said: “Be content what I leave with you, for those who came before you were destroyed because they asked too many questions and argued with their Prophets. If I tell you to do something then do as much of it as you can, and if I tell you not to do something then abstain from it.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1337)
Ibn 'Abbas narrated that al-Aqra’ ibn Habis asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “O Messenger of Allah, is Hajj every year or just once?” He said: “It is only once, and whoever does more than that, it is a voluntary (act of worship).” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1721; classed as sahih by al-Albani) 
Hadiths on doing Hajj a great deal
With regard to what is preferable, the more a Muslim does of Hajj , the better, even if he can do Hajj every year. There are reports which encourage doing Hajj a great deal, such as the following: 

Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked: which deed is best? He said: “Believing in Allah and His Messenger.” He was asked: Then what? He said: “Jihad for the sake of Allah.” He was asked: Then what? He said: “An accepted Hajj.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 26; Muslim, 83) 
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever does Hajj for the sake of Allah, and does not utter any obscenity or commit any immoral action, will go back (sinless) as on the day his mother bore him.” (Al-Bukhari, 1449; Muslim, 1350) 
‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Make the Hajj and ‘Umrah follow each other closely, for they remove poverty and sins as the bellows removes the dross of iron, gold and silver, and an accepted Hajj brings no less a reward than Paradise.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 810; al-Nasai, 2631. Classed as sahih by Shaykh al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Sahihah, 1200)

41199,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41199,Beating Wife in Islam,"To be honest, I was really astonished to read how you answer all the questions cleverly. I really want to know more about Islam but every time I know something new, I get suspicious about it bravely, I would like to know if it is correct that the Quran permits a man to beat his wife. If that’s true, how could you explain that?","There is nothing in the Quran that suggests that a husband is allowed to beat his wife. She is to be honored and treated kindly, even when one no longer feels love in one's heart towards her.",,"Praise be to Allah.We are very happy that you are reading our site and are keen to learn about Islam. We ask Allah to guide you to that which will bring you happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. 
There is nothing in the Quran that suggests that a man is allowed to beat his wife . 

The Quran enjoins good treatment of one's wife: she is to be honoured and treated kindly, even when one no longer feels love in one's heart towards her. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“and live with them honourably. If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a thing and Allah brings through it a great deal of good.” [al-Nisa 4:19] 

The Quran explains that women have rights over their husbands , just as their husbands have rights over them. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable, but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise” [al-Baqarah 2:228] 
This verse indicates that the man has additional rights, commensurate with his role as protector and maintainer and his responsibility of spending (on his wife) etc. 

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined kind treatment and honouring of one’s wife, and he described the best of people as those who are best to their wives. He said: “The best of you are those who are the best to their wives, and I am the best of you to my wives.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3895; Ibn Majah, 1977; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi) 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) spoke a beautiful word concerning kind treatment of one’s wife, stating that when the husband feeds his wife and puts a morsel of food in her mouth, he earns the reward of doing an act of charity. He said, “You never spend anything but you will be rewarded for it, even the morsel of food that you lift to your wife’s mouth.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6352; Muslim, 1628) 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Fear Allah with regard to women, for you have taken them as a trust from Allah and intimacy with them has become permissible to you by the words of Allah. Your right over them is that they should not allow anyone to sit on your furniture whom you dislike; if they do that then hit them but not in a harsh manner. And their right over you is that you should provide for them and clothe them on a reasonable basis.” Narrated by Muslim, 1218. 

What is meant by “they should not allow anyone to sit on your furniture whom you dislike” is that they should not allow anyone whom you dislike to enter your houses, whether the person disliked is a man or a woman, or any of the woman’s mahrams [close relatives to whom marriage is forbidden]. The prohibition includes all of them. (From the words of al-Nawawi) 
The hadith may be understood as meaning that a man has the right to hit his wife, in a manner that is not harsh and does not cause injury if there is a reason for that, such as her going against his wishes or disobeying him. 
This is like the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“As to those women on whose part you see ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (next) refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful); but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). Surely, Allah is Ever Most High, Most Great” [al-Nisa 4:34] 
If a woman rebels against her husband and disobeys his commands, then he should follow this method of admonishing her, forsaking her in bed and hitting her. Hitting is subject to the condition that it should not be harsh or cause injury. 
Al-Hasan al-Basri said: “This means that it should not cause pain.” 
‘Ata said: I said to Ibn `Abbas, what is the kind of hitting that is not harsh? He said, Hitting with a siwak and the like. [A siwak is a small stick or twig used for cleaning the teeth - Translator] 
The purpose behind this is not to hurt or humiliate the woman, rather it is intended to make her realize that she has transgressed against her husband’s rights, and that her husband has the right to set her straight and discipline her.
